President Joe Biden has decided to break with a longstanding tradition, opting not to file his name on New Hampshire’s Democratic presidential primary ballot for the upcoming 2024 elections. This move has sent ripples through the political landscape, as New Hampshire has proudly held the first presidential primary for both major political parties for a century.

The Biden 2024 re-election campaign, led by campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez, announced this decision on Tuesday, citing compliance with the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) new rules as the primary reason. The DNC is looking to shake up the traditional presidential nominating calendar, and as a result, has pledged to penalize candidates who participate in unsanctioned primaries. New Hampshire, planning to hold its primary ahead of South Carolina, is set to be non-compliant with these new rules.

While this decision aligns with the DNC’s strategic shift to empower minority voters and redistribute the influence of early voting states, it also breaks a century-old tradition that has been a point of pride for New Hampshire. New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan has made it clear that the state’s primary will proceed as planned, regardless of the DNC’s alterations to the nominating calendar.

This move by President Biden could potentially open the door for other Democratic candidates to gain traction in New Hampshire. The state’s primary has been a crucial stepping stone for presidential hopefuls, and Biden’s absence from the ballot could lead to a protest vote or boost the visibility of other candidates.

Among those considering a run is Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is reportedly mulling a primary challenge against Biden. Phillips' potential entry into the race could stir the political pot even further, introducing new dynamics to an already unconventional election cycle.

Despite these changes, top Democrats in New Hampshire are gearing up for a write-in campaign for Biden, demonstrating their continued support for the President. However, this does not negate the fact that Biden’s decision has left a mark on the state’s political tradition.

Biden’s strategy reflects a broader shift in the Democratic Party, emphasizing the importance of diversity and representation in the election process. The DNC’s new calendar positions South Carolina, a state with a significant African American voting bloc, as the first primary, followed by New Hampshire and Nevada.

While Republicans have opted to keep their nominating calendar largely unchanged, the Democrats’ strategic shakeup aims to better align the party’s values with its voter base. As the 2024 election approaches, all eyes will be on how these changes impact the race for the Democratic nomination and whether Biden’s unconventional move pays off in the long run.

In conclusion, President Biden’s decision to skip the New Hampshire primary marks a significant departure from tradition, reflecting the Democratic Party’s evolving strategy and the shifting dynamics of presidential elections.
