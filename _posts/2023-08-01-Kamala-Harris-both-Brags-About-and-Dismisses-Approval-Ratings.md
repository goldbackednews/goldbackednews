This week Vice President Kamala Harris played down the importance of approval ratings while also claiming polls show her having “great approval ratings.”

In a Monday interview on ABC, Harris was asked is she thinks “race and gender” are to blame with reports that she has “the lowest approval rating of any vice president.”

Harris responded “"Well, there are polls that also say I have great approval ratings. I think the point that has to be made is that there are attempts to create distractions away from the accomplishments of our administration.

We've created over 13 million jobs since we've been in office. Joe Biden and I have been responsible for 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in the United States, not to mention what we have done to restore America's integrity on the international stage."

Harris was also asked in her ABC interview about a statement by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) about launching an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden and his family.

"I don't really have much to say about, again, the kind of the — the cinema and the grand gestures that are political games," Harris responded.

Recent Fox News, Monmouth University, and Legler polls show VP Harris having a negative approval rating. RealClearPolitics shows Harris’ average job approval rating as 40.7% approval, 52.7% disapproval. FiveThirtyEight's polling average showed Harris with an average rating of 40.2% approval, 51.2% disapproval as of July 23.
