Elizabeth Polanco De Los Santos, a 21-year-old American college student, faced an unexpected twist during her travels. What was supposed to be a 10-hour layover in Dubai turned into a four-month-long legal challenge, landing her on the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) no-fly list and resulting in a year-long jail sentence. 

De Los Santos, after vacationing in Turkey, was returning home via Dubai International Airport. However, things took a turn on July 14 when she encountered issues with customs officials. The New York student's "waist trainer" corset, which she wore due to recent surgery, set off detectors, leading to further screening. In a private room, when asked to remove her garment, she tried explaining her medical condition, which required the corset. Feeling "violated" during this process, De Los Santos reportedly touched an airport official's arm, a gesture that escalated into accusations of "assault and insult."

The altercation's aftermath was swift and severe. Despite paying a fine of AED 10,000 ($2,722 USD), De Los Santos received a year-long jail sentence. Her original flight on July 15 came and went without her. Furthermore, the UAE's automatic appeal process implies she could be in the country for an indefinite period.

Radha Stirling, chief executive of "Detained in Dubai," emphasized the consequences of transiting through Dubai. The organization, which advocates for travelers stuck in such challenging situations in the UAE, is currently supporting De Los Santos. Stirling points out that government employees in Dubai could potentially exploit situations like these, seeking out-of-court settlements. She strongly believes that the reputation of UAE as a reliable transport and tourism hub is at stake due to incidents of this nature.

De Los Santos' next court appearance is slated for October 24. In the meantime, "Detained in Dubai" is tirelessly working to assist her. The organization, established in 2008, has previously aided US national Tierra Young Allen, known as "Sassy Trucker" on TikTok, who found herself in a similar predicament in the UAE.

For travelers, De Los Santos' experience serves as a cautionary tale about the unforeseen complications that might arise during international transit. As her ordeal continues, it also highlights the pressing need for transparency and fair treatment in international legal systems.
