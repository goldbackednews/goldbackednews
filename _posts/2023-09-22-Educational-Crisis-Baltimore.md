In a shocking revelation, state math exams have found that not a single student from 13 high schools in Baltimore, Maryland, demonstrated proficiency in math. This alarming statistic has triggered severe concern over the state of education in the region, with officials and experts calling it “educational homicide.”

### A Grave Scenario
The 13 schools in question, including renowned names like Patterson High School and Frederick Douglass, are part of 33 city schools in Baltimore. This implies a whopping 40% of the city schools are entangled in this educational crisis. Jason Rodriguez, deputy director of a local non-profit People Empowered by the Struggle, called out the rampant system, emphasizing a dire need for accountability rather than funding.

### Numbers Speak Volumes
Of the 1,736 students who took the test in these 13 schools, a staggering 1,295 students, making up 74.5%, scored one out of four— the lowest possible score. This situation is especially startling considering the substantial financial resources invested in the district. Last school year, Baltimore City Schools received a record $1.6 billion from taxpayers, and an additional $799 million in Covid relief funding from the federal government.

### A Recurring Issue
This isn’t the first time Baltimore City Schools have been under the scanner for such dismal educational outcomes. A comparable report by Project Baltimore in 2017 also highlighted zero math proficiency in 13 schools, some of which continue to struggle with the same issue.

### The Response
City Schools attribute these results to years of underfunding and the recent pandemic. They argue that recent increments in funds don't nullify the damage caused by chronic underfunding over the years, and that improvement in such a situation would require significant time and effort. 

### Beyond the Tests
This predicament goes beyond mere numbers and test scores, shedding light on deeper, systemic issues in education. The reality of these alarming scores opens up urgent discussions on the structure, functionality, and effectiveness of the educational systems in place and raises critical questions about the future of the students affected by it.

### Conclusion
The consistent educational crisis in Baltimore, marked by zero proficiency in math across several high schools, is a disturbing indicator of deep-rooted issues in the educational landscape. This situation demands immediate attention, thorough investigation, and robust reforms to ensure that every student has access to quality education, which is essential for shaping a prosperous and equitable future.
