In a country built on the ideals of freedom and individual rights, the Biden administration's latest act of perceived overreach has many conservatives sounding the alarm. The United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in its groundbreaking decision, has implied that President Biden and his team might have dangerously trampled upon the sacred First Amendment rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This isn't just about governance; it's about the very essence of our democracy. The court has pointed out how key figures in the administration, including those at the very top in the White House, the Surgeon General's office, CDC, and even the FBI, seem to have used their positions to unduly and coercively influence online content moderation decisions.

The three-judge panel didn't mince words: "We find that the White House, acting in concert with the Surgeon General's office, likely coerced the platforms to make their moderation decisions ... and significantly encouraged the platforms' decisions."

The FBI, long considered an impartial agency, was also not spared. The panel suggested that the FBI went far beyond its mandate, not only influencing platforms but also proactively inducing changes to moderation policies. Actions that, many argue, reek of constitutional infringement.

While the original lower court injunction was wide in its scope, the revised order now specifically targets and holds accountable these entities: the White House, Surgeon General's office, CDC, and FBI. It's a move that many see as the Fifth Circuit stepping up to defend the Constitution from executive overreach.

U.S. Senator Eric Schmitt didn't hold back in his response, labeling the decision a "massive victory for free speech." In a rallying cry to all freedom-loving Americans, he emphasized, "Because of Missouri v. Biden, the federal government is prohibited yet again from colluding with social media giants to censor freedom of speech online."

As the Biden administration scrambles to respond, their attempt at defense seems weak at best. While they review the decision and weigh their options, one thing is clear: the American people are watching. With the potential for this case to be elevated to the Supreme Court, it serves as a grim reminder of the need for vigilance in defending our freedoms against potential governmental overreach.

In a nation that champions liberty and freedom of speech, one must wonder: How did we get here, and how do we ensure our rights remain unassailable?
