Britney Spears, the beloved pop sensation, is opening up about her life in her new memoir, "The Woman in Me," set to be released on October 24th. One of the most shocking revelations from the excerpts released on Tuesday is the disclosure of her abortion during her relationship with pop icon Justin Timberlake.

Spears candidly writes, “If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,” referring to the abortion. She further elaborates, sharing that Timberlake "was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father." This personal revelation is set to provide readers with an intimate look into the singer's private struggles and decisions.

Their whirlwind romance began when both Spears and Timberlake were young performers on Disney’s Mickey Mouse Club. The duo later started dating in their late teens, swiftly becoming the talk of Tinseltown and one of the most-watched couples in the entertainment arena. Their high-profile relationship ended in 2002.

The "Baby One More Time" singer recalls Timberlake's reaction to her pregnancy, sharing he "definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy." Spears adds, "He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young." The heartbreak and emotional turmoil from the abortion are evident in her words, as she describes it as "one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life."

Britney's memoir doesn't stop at her relationship with Timberlake. She dives deep into the controversial conservatorship that dominated her life for 14 years. Under this legal guardianship, she felt her autonomy stripped away. Spears recalls the conservatorship's control over even her reproductive rights, sharing that she was prevented from removing a contraceptive IUD despite wanting another child. "The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child,” Spears remarks.

Reflecting on the extended period of control her father and his associates had over her personal and financial affairs, Spears writes, “I think back now... and it makes me feel sick.”

The pop sensation's memoir is also expected to touch upon her personal life after Timberlake. Spears had two sons with her second husband, Kevin Federline. Following a very public breakdown in 2008, Spears entered into the previously mentioned conservatorship led by her father, Jamie. Fortunately, this conservatorship came to an end in November 2021.

However, life hasn't been entirely rosy for the star since. In 2022, she announced a miscarriage and later, in August, her third husband, Sam Asghari, stated they were filing for divorce.

"The Woman in Me" promises to be a compelling read, providing fans with an unfiltered look into the life of a pop music legend.
