In an exclusive interview at the Iowa State Fair, former Vice President Mike Pence confirmed his intention to sign the Republican National Committee (RNC) loyalty pledge. This move solidifies his position among the eight Republican presidential candidates set to participate in the upcoming GOP debate on August 23 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But with Donald Trump's recent comments in mind, the political landscape becomes increasingly convoluted.

"I’m more than happy to meet the criteria," Pence told Fox News during his stroll through the State Fairgrounds. "I’m confident I’ll be able to support the Republican nominee, especially if it’s me."

## RNC's Loyalty Pledge

The RNC's loyalty pledge requests candidates to commit their support for the GOP's eventual presidential nominee, irrespective of who it might be. Additionally, the pledge necessitates candidates not to participate in any unsanctioned debates.

While Pence openly confirms his commitment, the spotlight turns towards Trump. How would Pence react if Trump, his former running mate and a current front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination, secures the ticket?

Despite their shared history, the two leaders have drifted apart following the events of January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters infamously stormed the U.S. Capitol. Pence, who was at the Capitol overseeing a joint session of Congress, faced threats from rioters and has since been a target of Trump loyalists.

Reflecting on the past and addressing the challenges of the present, Pence stated, "I’m very proud of the record of the Trump administration. But in the last two and a half years, the former president has insisted that I had the power to overturn the election, which I did not." 

## Trump's Stand

Trump, who currently leads in the GOP nomination race, expressed skepticism about the pledge. In a recent interview, he remarked, "Why would I sign a pledge if there are people on there that I wouldn’t have?" The former president is yet to decide if he will participate in the upcoming debate.

Pence, addressing Trump’s hesitancy, emphasized that every candidate should be on the debate stage. "Everyone willing to be considered in the upcoming primaries owes it to the American people to share their vision," Pence asserted.

With the stage set for the debate and the lines being drawn, the Republican party braces itself for an intense nomination race, one with potential reverberations far beyond the debate podium.
