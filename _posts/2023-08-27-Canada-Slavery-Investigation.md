In a significant development, the Canadian Ombudsman for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) has declared its intent to investigate potential connections between the Canadian branches of global brands - Walmart, Hugo Boss, and Diesel, and the alleged use of Uyghur slavery in their supply chains.

CORE, a potent human rights watchdog, has the authority to scrutinize human rights infringements linked to global supply chains of corporations that operate within Canadian territory. Their interventions can be a result of referrals or be self-initiated. 

The latest move from CORE arises from accusations made by human rights groups suggesting that Chinese suppliers, associated with the aforementioned companies, might have tapped into the oppressed Uyghur Muslim workforce from East Turkistan, commonly referred to as Xinjiang by China.

Given China's dominant presence in the cotton industry - supplying a significant portion of global cotton, the fact that Xinjiang alone contributes to almost 90% of the country’s cotton output raises pertinent questions.

The heart of the matter, Sheri Meyerhoffer, CORE’s primary spokesperson, highlights, revolves around the reluctance of the three giants, Walmart, Hugo Boss, and Diesel, to be part of a preliminary examination into reports of slavery. This impelled CORE to undertake a more comprehensive investigation. Meyerhoffer states, “We are hopeful that the investigation findings will provide the companies with information to support their ability to strengthen their due diligence practices.”

While all three entities have fervently denied sourcing goods tinged by forced labor, a spokesperson for Hugo Boss went on record to state that they have no direct supply links originating from the Xinjiang region. However, past ties with the Changji Esquel Group, a prominent Chinese cotton supplier known to camouflage its Xinjiang-sourced cotton, are hard to ignore. Hugo Boss’s relationship with the supplier came to a silent end in early 2022.

Furthermore, revelations from human rights alliances suggest evidence of intricate connections between Hugo Boss Canada and a subsidiary in Xinjiang, revealing a complex web of cotton sourcing and potential human rights infringements.

Diesel, known for its fashion-forward stance, also finds itself in the crosshairs. Allegations point towards its business ties with Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng, another supplier purportedly employing Uyghur slaves. Similarly, Walmart's dealings with multiple companies suspected of leveraging forced labor have come under the scanner.

In response, Diesel emphasized its commitment to ethical sourcing, vowing to adhere to global human rights standards across its supply chain. Walmart Canada mirrored this stance, underlining its zero-tolerance policy towards any form of forced labor within its supply chain.

However, CORE remains undeterred. Comments on Diesel's evasion from preliminary assessments raise “questions related to the degree of transparency in its human rights due diligence practices,” while Hugo Boss's approach is criticized for not acknowledging the intricate nature of garment supply chains.

The ongoing investigation underscores the importance of ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency in an increasingly interconnected global marketplace. As these big names await CORE's findings, the world watches with bated breath, hoping for a future where human rights triumph over corporate interests.
