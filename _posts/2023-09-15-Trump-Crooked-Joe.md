In a fiery denouncement, former President Donald Trump recently castigated the indictment of Hunter Biden on three gun charges, notably emphasizing their lack of connection to President Joe Biden, whom he infamously termed "Crooked Joe". This overt criticism not only underscores Trump's tenacious grip on conservative narratives but also showcases the deep-seated partisanship that continues to dominate American politics.

**Trump on Hunter's Charges: The Tip of the Iceberg?**

Trump's recent post on Truth Social succinctly encapsulated his stance on the matter: "This, the gun charge, is the only crime that Hunter Biden committed that does not implicate Crooked Joe Biden. One down, Eleven to go!" With this remark, the former President alludes to eleven other allegations made by Republican lawmakers concerning Hunter Biden's purported tax and money laundering crimes.

Further cementing his position, Trump lamented the Democrats' actions, equating them to opening a "Pandora's Box" that might spell doom for the very fabric of the country. In his words, "The Democrats, with all of their horrible, very unfair, and mostly illegal Witch Hunts, have started a process that is very dangerous for our Country... SO SAD!!!"

**Debunking the "Neutral" Prosecutor Narrative**

Adding another layer to this complicated saga, Trump highlighted the role of David Weiss, the Department of Justice special counsel who announced the indictment against Hunter Biden. Contrary to the mainstream media and Democrats' narrative that portrayed Weiss as a Trump-appointed neutral figure, the former President shed light on a deeper connection. "Prosecutor Weiss is appointed by the 2 Democrat Senators of Delaware under Blue Slip!" Trump revealed, thus exposing the longstanding Senate policy known as the "blue slip", which allows senators from the home state to greenlight presidential appointments of U.S. attorneys and judges.

It's worth noting that Weiss has been on Hunter Biden's case for alleged tax evasion and gun charges since 2018. A potential plea deal was once on the table, which would have granted Hunter immunity from jail time and further prosecution. However, this deal, which smells suspiciously of privilege and nepotism, foundered when Delaware U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika declined to endorse it. Following this, in a twist, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Weiss as special counsel in August.

**Unraveling a Political Web**

Hunter Biden's indictment brings to the forefront a plethora of unanswered questions about the Biden family's dealings, especially in the context of the former Vice President and current President Joe Biden. The murkiness surrounding these allegations, combined with the intense scrutiny and criticism from conservative quarters led by influential figures like Trump, calls for transparent investigations. If the Bidens have nothing to hide, they should welcome these inquiries. For now, all eyes are on what unfolds next in this politically charged drama.
