As the 2024 elections loom, the political landscape appears to be in flux, with GOP hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy making a startling prediction regarding the fate of current President Joe Biden.

In an engaging discussion on FNC’s "Jesse Watters Primetime", Ramaswamy posited that Biden, despite being the face of the Democratic Party, might soon be maneuvered "out of the way" by his very own political allies. Lending weight to this assertion, he hinted at a larger play at hand, labeling Biden as a potential "sacrificial lamb."

Jesse Watters, noting the fluctuating poll numbers and evident tension within the Democratic camp, probed Ramaswamy for his take. "Joe Biden, not looking so good,” Watters began, “how are things looking to you as a Republican?”

Ramaswamy, never one to mince his words, confidently stated, “I was happy to see that I’m beating Joe Biden in that poll and doing just fine.” However, it was his subsequent remarks that raised eyebrows. Diving into the heart of the matter, he contended, “Joe Biden is a puppet for the managerial class... he’s a figurehead for the deep state and the managerial class.”

Such statements, while audacious, frame the current state of U.S. politics in a new light. Ramaswamy's observations suggest that there might be more to Biden's presidency than what meets the eye. He believes that if Biden's use reaches its end, the powers that be will merely "trot out the next puppet."

Adding another layer of intrigue, he referred to the recent indictment involving Hunter Biden, calling it a potential "smokescreen" and hinting at its use to edge Joe Biden out.

Ramaswamy's revelations, if accurate, depict a complicated and evolving political gameboard, with strategies and ploys going well beyond traditional party lines. As the countdown to the 2024 election begins, one can only anticipate more political drama to unfold.
