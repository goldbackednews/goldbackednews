Sheryl Crow, the musician behind hits like "If It Makes You Happy," recently spoke candidly about how her move from Los Angeles to Nashville, Tennessee, became a lifesaving decision.

## A Breath of Fresh Air

At the 2023 Sea.Hear.Now Music Festival in New Jersey, Crow connected with her audience, many of whom might be navigating through their own challenges. "I know how hard it is for especially young people... but these are some tricky waters to navigate now," she voiced.

Revealing a deeply personal insight, she shared, "I'll just tell you that, for me, getting out in nature really saved my life." This shift towards a more natural environment led her to buy a farm in Nashville, where she'd sit among the trees, seeking solace and inspiration. It was in this setting that she wrote "Cross Creek Road."

## Finding Her Roots

Sheryl's relocation to Nashville wasn't a mere whim. In 2003, she told Rolling Stone that she felt a deep connection to the city, not just because of her friends in the music business, but because of the warmth and simplicity of the people there. The hustle of cities like New York and L.A. paled in comparison to the serenity she felt in Nashville.

Moreover, a significant turning point in her life was her breast cancer diagnosis. She revealed to the New York Times that she bought her farm just two weeks post-diagnosis. "I didn't feel like I had roots anywhere," Crow reminisced about the time leading up to her move.

## A Mother First

Apart from finding personal tranquility, Tennessee also provided an ideal environment for raising her two adopted sons, Wyatt and Levi. Living there, Crow shared the benefits of a community-centric upbringing for her kids. It's a place where they can grow without the constant flash of cameras, where they can understand the value of helping others, and where they won't be hounded by paparazzi.

In an industry often filled with fleeting glamour, Sheryl Crow's story is a testament to the healing power of nature, the comfort of community, and the enduring bond of family.
