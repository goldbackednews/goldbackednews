In a move that underscores its technological ambitions, Iran unveiled its newest armed drone on Tuesday, the Mohajer-10. Strikingly, this drone bears a close resemblance to America's renowned MQ-9 Reaper. Moreover, state media sources are asserting that this new addition to Iran's aerial arsenal has the operational prowess to reach as far as Israel.

### Showcasing the Mohajer-10

The debut of the Mohajer-10 took place during an event marking the Islamic Republic's Defense Industry Day. The drone's specs, as outlined by the state-run IRNA News Agency, are certainly impressive. It can continuously soar the skies for 24 hours and has an operational reach of approximately 1,200 miles. The Mohajer-10 is also capable of bearing a bomb load that weighs up to 660 pounds.

In terms of speed, this drone can hit a peak of 130 mph and, according to IRNA, is furnished with "electronic warfare and intelligence-gathering systems."

### The Iranian Stance

During the event, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi lauded the country's technological achievements, proclaiming on state television: "Today, we can firmly introduce Iran as an advanced and technologic nation to the world." Footage disseminated by IRNA illustrated the drone making its rounds on a moving platform, with subsequent visuals showing it allegedly taking off from an unspecified location.

However, the veracity of this footage is yet to be ascertained independently.

### Historical Context

The nomenclature "Mohajer" translates to "immigrant" in Farsi. The Mohajer-10 represents the newest generation in a drone series that Iran has been producing since 1985. Historically, Iran has managed to capture U.S. drones or parts of them. However, no proof currently indicates Iran's possession of a General Atomics' Reaper.

It's worth noting that in the past, North Korea had flaunted drones echoing the Reaper's design, presumably based on publicly accessible data about the aircraft.

### Looking Back

Iran's history with drones, particularly those of the U.S., has been marked by contentious incidents. In December 2011, the nation intercepted an RQ-170 Sentinel operated by the CIA, purposed to survey Iranian nuclear establishments. This drone had breached Iranian airspace from the adjacent Afghanistan. Subsequent to this event, Iran reverse-engineered the drone, crafting their indigenous versions. Additionally, in 2019, during escalating tensions over a defunct nuclear agreement with global superpowers, Iran brought down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk in the Strait of Hormuz.

The unveiling of the Mohajer-10 is a clear testament to Iran's growing technological might and its determination to be a significant player in global aerial warfare.
