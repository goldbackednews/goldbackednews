The rock world was met with a jolt of concern after legendary Aerosmith frontman, Steven Tyler, revealed that he had suffered from vocal cord damage during a recent concert in New York. This has subsequently led to the postponement of several shows from their much-anticipated "Peace Out" farewell tour.

Sharing his distress over the situation, Tyler took to the band's social media platforms, stating, "I’m heartbroken to say I have received strict doctor’s orders not to sing for the next thirty days... We’ll need to postpone a few dates so that we can come back and give you the performance you deserve."

Aerosmith's "Peace Out" tour, marking a capstone for the band's illustrious 50-year career in the industry, commenced earlier this month in Philadelphia. The tour was set to feature 40 shows, bringing the iconic band's journey to a close.

In light of Tyler's injury, concert dates in cities including Detroit, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Toronto, Raleigh, and Cleveland will be rescheduled. The band has assured fans that all previously acquired tickets will be valid for the rearranged dates. Additionally, for those fans unable to adjust to the new dates, refunds have been made available.

This isn't the first time concerns surrounding Tyler's health have come to the forefront. In December 2022, Aerosmith had to cancel the concluding shows of their Las Vegas residency. As per the band's statement at the time, "On the advice of doctors, Steven has to sit these out."

Furthermore, a few months ago, the band's Las Vegas residency shows scheduled for June and July were also canceled due to a concerning relapse by Tyler following a foot surgery. The band had then expressed their unwavering support for Tyler's focus on his health and recovery.

While the band grapples with the current setback, Steven Tyler is also presently contending with legal issues. He is dealing with a sexual assault lawsuit, an allegation he has vehemently denied.

For now, fans worldwide send their well wishes to Tyler for a swift recovery, hoping to see him back on stage, delivering those iconic performances that have made Aerosmith a global rock phenomenon.
