Two years have passed since a fateful day in Afghanistan. The nation remembers the 13 brave U.S. service members who lost their lives during a tragic suicide bombing amid what many call the Biden administration's "disastrous" and "botched" withdrawal from the country.

On the second anniversary of this devastating event, lawmakers from all sides took to social media platforms to commemorate the service and sacrifice of those who lost their lives in Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport. The attack not only took 13 American lives but also resulted in injuries to almost two dozen others. 

The tragedy saw 10 Marines, two Army soldiers, and a Navy corpsman fall victim to an assault that will remain etched in the nation's memory. The bombing was followed by a shootout initiated by Islamic State militants, exacerbating the chaos outside Kabul's airport. The preceding night saw nearly 5,000 Afghans, alongside potential Americans, trying to access the airport in a desperate attempt to flee.

U.S. Representative Rob Wittman pointed out the significance of the date, stating, "Two years ago today, we witnessed the deadliest attack on U.S. forces in over a decade." Adding fuel to the already heated topic, he highlighted that no member of the Biden administration has yet been held accountable for their handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Echoing this sentiment, House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik honored the brave 13, criticizing President Bidenâ€™s withdrawal strategy as the direct reason for the "deadliest attack on Americans in Afghanistan since 2011."

House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers took the criticism a step further, expressing it was "unfathomable" that no one from the Biden administration faced consequences for the mismanaged retreat. Rep. Steve Womack and several other leaders joined the chorus, emphasizing the importance of remembering the fallen heroes and ensuring accountability for the tragedy.

But amidst the political wrangling, it's essential to remember the sacrifice of these 13 brave souls. As the nation recalls the Kabul airport attack, it serves as a reminder of the cost of freedom and the sacrifice made by those who defend it. 

In the words of Rep. Cory Mills, the day is not just about holding leaders accountable, but also standing with the "Gold Star families" and demanding transparency. It's about remembering, honoring, and ensuring that such a tragedy is never repeated.
