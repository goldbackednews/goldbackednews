In a horrifying revelation, a woman's severed head was found in a London canal, not far from where dismembered body parts had been earlier discovered inside a suitcase. This grim tale was revealed in a British court on Friday.

33-year-old Arizo Nour was arraigned via video link at the renowned Old Bailey, London's central criminal court. Nour is charged with the murder of a 57-year-old woman, whose identity is being withheld due to legal constraints, as reported by The Sun.

Prosecutors described to the court the grisly series of events: earlier in the week, "human body parts" were retrieved from a canal near Bulls Bridge Lane. It was on Thursday that a severed head, believed to belong to the same victim, was found inside a bag within the canal.

Further unfolding the chilling narrative, it was stated that authorities had been called to a residence on August 6, only to find "large quantities of blood." Alerted by the discovery, the police marked Nour as a person of interest. The prosecutor, Louise Oakley, articulated the urgency of the situation, noting concerns raised about the victim's wellbeing, as she hadn't been in contact for over 24 hours.

The search eventually led to a suitcase in the canal, with its macabre contents revealing human body parts.

With the case sending shockwaves through the community, Nour remains in police custody. As of the latest report, no bail application has been made on his behalf.
