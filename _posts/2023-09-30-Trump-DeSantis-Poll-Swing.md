Former President Donald Trump appears to be strengthening his political influence, witnessing a remarkable 8-point swing in support among likely Republican primary voters, following the second GOP debate on Wednesday night, a debate he did not attend. This surge intensifies the anticipation surrounding potential candidates in the upcoming elections, with Trump now commanding a 51-point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

### Trump’s Gaining Momentum
Just two days before the debate, a Morning Consult’s poll revealed 58% support for Trump. Intriguingly, his absence from the debate didn’t deter his supporters. Post-debate, his backing surged to 63%, implying that his political maneuvers and strategies continue to resonate with a substantial segment of the GOP electorate.

### DeSantis Faces Setback
Conversely, DeSantis experienced a fall in the polls, dropping three points to 12%, a significant decline from his 15% on Monday. The sizable shift from Monday to Thursday, as highlighted by Morning Consult, is particularly noteworthy, considering there was no significant change in GOP electorate’s views after the first Republican debate in August.

### The Overall GOP Landscape
Vivek Ramaswamy also saw a decline, losing two points and resting at seven percent support post-debate. No other candidate in the fray managed to poll higher than five percent. The fluctuating support percentages reflect the ongoing dynamism and unpredictability within the GOP, emphasizing the need for candidates to refine their approaches and connect more effectively with the electorate.

### Declining Viewership
The second GOP debate marked a 26% drop in viewership compared to the first, attracting less than 10 million viewers according to Nielsen ratings. Trump’s deliberate avoidance of the debates, owing to his substantial lead in the polls, has potentially contributed to this reduced interest among viewers, underscoring his pivotal role in drawing public attention to GOP events.

### Trump’s Alternative Engagement
Opting out of the debate, Trump chose to address striking autoworkers in Michigan instead, demonstrating his knack for tapping into populist sentiments and maintaining a direct connection with his base, irrespective of the formal political stage.

### Conclusion
The significant shift in support towards Trump and away from DeSantis post-debate underscores the former President’s enduring impact on the Republican voter base. The continued shifts and realignments within GOP supporter preferences point to an evolving political landscape, where absence seems to make the heart grow fonder, at least in the case of Donald Trump. The unfolding scenario also raises questions about the effectiveness of debates in altering voter preferences and the broader implications for GOP dynamics moving forward.
