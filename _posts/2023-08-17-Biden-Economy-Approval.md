A significant majority of Americans have expressed their discontent with how President Biden has managed the U.S. economy, as revealed by a recent poll.

The poll, a collaborative effort by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, unveiled that a meager 36% of Americans feel positively about Biden's economic governance. Notably, this percentage trails his overall approval rate, which stands at 42%.

Despite persistent attempts by the White House to champion and amplify the "Bidenomics" agenda over recent weeks, Biden's economic approval ratings have remained consistent - and consistently low - echoing numbers from two months prior. Within his own party, more than half of the Democrats (55%) believe Biden shouldn't campaign for the presidency again. However, if he is chosen as the nominee, 82% expressed their willingness to cast their vote in his favor.

The methodological rigor of this poll, conducted from August 10-14, relied on a sample from NORCâ€™s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, curated to mirror the demographics and sentiments of the U.S. populace.

Another survey from Monmouth University in July corroborated these findings. A staggering 62% voiced their disapproval of Biden's approach to tackling inflation, a metric where only 34% extended their support. The inflationary cloud has lingered ominously, causing Americans to dig deeper into their pockets, with monthly expenditures surging considerably compared to a couple of years ago.

A surprising revelation from another poll last week highlighted that neither Biden nor former President Donald Trump, current frontrunners for the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries respectively, enjoy substantial popularity. Astonishingly, King Charles III of the United Kingdom garnered more American admiration than either political figure. Both Biden and Trump managed to secure nearly identical favorability scores, hovering around the 41% mark.
