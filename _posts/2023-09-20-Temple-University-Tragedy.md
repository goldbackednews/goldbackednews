In a deeply tragic turn of events, JoAnne A. Epps, the acting president of Temple University, collapsed on stage during a memorial service on Tuesday. She was immediately rushed to the hospital but was sadly pronounced dead upon arrival.

Epps, 72, was attending a service in honor of Charles L. Blockson, a significant figure associated with the Blockson Collection at the university. The unexpected incident has sent shockwaves through the Temple University community and beyond.

In a heartfelt statement released by the university, the extent of her impact was clear. "President Epps was a devoted servant and friend who represented the best parts of Temple. She spent nearly 40 years of her life serving this university, and her loss will reverberate through the community for years to come."

The exact cause of her demise has not been disclosed yet. Temple University Provost, Gregory Mandel, visibly shaken by the event, commented on Epps, saying, "We are all in deep grief and at a loss for words. To know Joanne is to be her friend. She was one of the most remarkably compassionate and caring individuals Iâ€™ve ever known."

Epps had a longstanding and influential role within Temple University. Prior to her position as acting president, she served as the dean of the university's law school and later as provost. Her rise to the role of acting president came in the wake of the resignation of Jason Wingard, Temple's first Black president. Reflecting on her journey, Epps had shared with local news, "I would never have imagined even becoming a professor at Temple, let alone being in this position."

Pennsylvania's Governor, Josh Shapiro, paid his respects by referring to Epps as a "powerful force and constant ambassador for Temple University for nearly four decades." Expressing his grief on X (previously known as Twitter), he mentioned how this loss deeply impacts not just the university, but the entire city of Philadelphia.

As acting president, Epps had been actively addressing vital concerns, notably focusing on the university's enrollment and challenges tied to rising crime near the campus.

As Temple University, Philadelphia, and the broader academic community grapple with this tragic loss, the legacy and contributions of JoAnne A. Epps will undoubtedly be remembered and cherished.
