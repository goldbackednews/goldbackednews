Hollywood has had a long-standing and complex relationship with Scientology. From its high-profile members to the drama surrounding its practices, the Church of Scientology often finds itself under the Tinseltown spotlight. 

## Danny Masterson and Scientology’s Trial Tangle

Actor Danny Masterson, best known for his role in "That '70s Show," recently faced a rape trial where his faith became a significant talking point. Found guilty on two counts of forcible rape, Masterson's sentencing shed light on the secretive world of Scientology. Though the Church was not directly implicated in the case, the trial proceedings painted a troubling picture.

Victims, all members of the Church at the time, were reportedly hesitant to come forward due to the organization's strict protocols against public involvement with member issues. Deputy District Attorney Ariel Anson told jurors, "The church taught his victims: ‘Rape isn’t rape, you caused this, and above all, you are never allowed to go to law enforcement.’"

In a counter-statement, the Church of Scientology stated, "The Church was not a party to this case and religion did not belong in this proceeding as Supreme Court precedent has maintained for centuries."

## Leah Remini - From Faithful Follower to Fierce Critic

Former Scientologist Leah Remini has been one of the Church's most vocal critics since she left in 2013. Celebrating Masterson's victims for their courage, she commented, "I am relieved that this dangerous rapist will be off the streets and unable to violently assault and rape women with the help of Scientology, a multi-billion-dollar criminal organization with tax-exempt status."

But Remini hasn't limited her criticisms to this recent trial. In her award-winning documentary series, she delves deep into the Church’s practices, sharing insights and exposing what she believes are its harmful activities. The Church, in response, has dismissed her claims as attempts "to appear relevant again."

## Tom Cruise - The Poster Boy of Scientology

No discussion of Scientology and Hollywood would be complete without mentioning Tom Cruise. One of the Church's most high-profile members, Cruise has remained largely loyal to his faith even as controversies raged around him.

However, his relationships, notably with Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes, have brought attention to the religion's influence in personal matters. Remini alluded that Scientology played a role in Cruise's split with Holmes, citing the Church's tendency to label detractors as suppressive persons.

## Scientology’s Other Celebrities and Controversies

Other celebrities, such as Kirstie Alley, have praised the Church for its positive impact on their lives. Alley, in particular, credited Scientology with helping her overcome her cocaine addiction.

On the other hand, filmmaker Paul Haggis, a former member, faced legal troubles connected to allegations of rape, with some speculating on the Church’s role in his life and actions.

## In the Spotlight

While it remains a divisive topic in Hollywood and beyond, Scientology's association with celebrities ensures it remains in the limelight. As more stories emerge, the relationship between Tinseltown and its most controversial faith continues to intrigue and baffle in equal measure.
