San Diego is currently grappling with a sharp rise in street prostitution, a disturbing trend following the recent implementation of California's controversial Senate Bill 357. This law, signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in July 2022, repealed an earlier law banning loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. Its primary aim was to protect transgender women and other vulnerable communities from targeted police harassment. However, it seems the bill may have led to some unintended consequences.

Local businesses have borne the brunt of this uptick in overt prostitution activities. Additional security measures have been implemented, with many installing lights to deter unwanted attention. Ironically, prostitutes are now using these very lights to attract customers. A long-time San Diego business owner lamented to Fox News Digital, "Costs for business, costs for security. We've had to put lights — at our cost — on the roof...the lights now help them when they want to come in front of my building to shake and do different things."

Crime related to the prostitution surge is also on the rise. Many business owners have reported break-ins, tire slashing, and thefts, which they believe to be retaliation acts by pimps or prostitutes.

At the center of the issue is the "Safer Streets Act" (Senate Bill 357). The law was designed to prevent the disproportionate harassment of Black and brown women and members of the LGBTQ community. While it doesn't legalize prostitution, it eliminates provisions that led to the said harassment. Nevertheless, its implementation has led to significant challenges for San Diego's streets.

Since the law took effect in January, many argue that it has empowered prostitutes and pimps, giving them the freedom to openly solicit customers without fear of legal repercussions. This visibility has caused discomfort for many residents, especially parents who must now explain to their young children the sight of near-naked women attempting to flag down vehicles during morning school commutes.

Despite the increasing issues, many feel that local politicians are not addressing the problem adequately. The business owner shared that no one from the city council's office has reached out to understand the gravity of the situation or discuss potential solutions. The business owner added, "I have yet to have anybody from the local city council's office contact anybody here in the neighborhood, come by, try to say, 'Hey, we're trying to help. How can we put some resources in like maybe some additional lights, maybe some additional cameras?'"

However, the mayor's office maintains that efforts are being made to tackle the problem. Mayor Gloria, who has spoken publicly about the issue, emphasized the police department's sting operations, which led to numerous arrests earlier this year.

With the challenges posed by SB 357 becoming increasingly evident, many hope for its repeal or at least a revisitation to address its shortcomings. As San Diego struggles, the need for a proactive approach becomes ever more critical to restore peace and security to its streets.
