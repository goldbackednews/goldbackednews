Amidst the whirlwind of political events, former President Donald Trump made headlines once again in an exclusive interview with Tucker Carlson. In what seemed to be counter-programming to the first Republican primary debate, Trump voiced his most pressing concern: the southern border.

**A Top Concern Amidst Global Issues**

When Carlson probed about his prime priority if re-elected, Trump was quick to spotlight the border. "Let’s say number one is a border and taking hundreds of thousands of criminals that have been allowed into our country and getting them out and bringing them back to their country,” he stated. This reveals Trump's consistent focus on border security, echoing his previous election's commitments.

**A Multinational Migration Concern**

Trump continued to detail the diversity of the migrants, mentioning, "Last month, we had 149 countries represented.” He emphasized the influx from regions some might find surprising, elaborating on the various origins and backgrounds of the immigrants. According to Trump, not only South American prisons but also mental institutions are being emptied out, resulting in a mix of individuals entering the US.

**A Promise for a Stronger Border**

Revisiting his previous term, Trump proudly stated the achievements on border control, highlighting the construction of nearly 500 miles of wall. Challenging the narratives that downplay his accomplishments, he emphasized, "I built 500 miles." He also alluded to plans for an additional 200-mile extension that was halted.

In his concluding remarks, the former president laid out a promise familiar to his previous election campaigns, with a renewed vigor: "The first thing I would do would be, I would seal up the border good and tight, except for people that want to come in legally,” assuring Americans of his undeterred focus on border security.
