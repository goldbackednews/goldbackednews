In a striking sign of the times, President Joe Biden appears to have united much of the nation, though perhaps not in the manner he would have anticipated. According to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, there's a sweeping consensus across party lines suggesting that Biden's age might be a hindrance to his capability of effectively serving another term.

A staggering 77% of the respondents in the poll agreed on the sentiment that Biden is perhaps too advanced in years to execute the office's responsibilities for another four. Breaking it down, while 89% of Republican respondents shared this view, even the Democratic base showcased significant reservations, with 69% echoing the same concerns. Importantly, this isn't an ageist perspective limited to the younger generation. Respondents from varied age groups expressed these concerns, although older Democrats were observed to be slightly more supportive of Biden's potential 2024 candidacy.

Drawing a parallel, roughly 50% of the surveyed U.S. adults opined that former President Trump might also be too old for the office. However, partisan lines were clearer here, with Democrats more inclined to emphasize Trump's age as a disqualifying factor compared to Republicans.

The AP-NORC poll, conducted from August 10 to 14, 2023, surveyed 1,165 adults and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. One significant takeaway from the poll is a possible shift in public sentiment, leaning towards younger leadership as opposed to the seasoned 80-year-old Democrat currently helming the White House.

This isn't the first time concerns regarding Biden's age have been raised. Being the oldest serving U.S. president, if Biden were to secure a reelection in 2024, he would exit office at the ripe age of 86 in 2029.

In a similar vein, a Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey for Newsweek earlier in August accentuated these concerns. Their findings showcased a prevailing apprehension among Democrats regarding Biden's ability to execute his duties. Interestingly, while most Biden voters acknowledged these concerns, there was even deeper division on whether his age should be a definitive factor against his candidacy.

In another related study in June, nearly half of the independent voters expressed reservations about Biden's age and health, suggesting that these could "severely limit" his capabilities as the President. An Economist-YouGov poll revealed that 45% of the adults surveyed were skeptical about the President's health and age impacting his ability to perform his duties.

As the 2024 elections loom, these age-related concerns are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the political narratives and campaign strategies.
