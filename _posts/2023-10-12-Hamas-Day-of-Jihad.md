In a significant political move, House Republicans have elected Majority Leader Steve Scalise, representing Louisiana, as their leading candidate for the esteemed role of House Speaker. This decision comes on the heels of an extensive, closed-door meeting that spanned more than two hours.

The GOP's decision-making process took the form of a secret ballot, wherein Scalise secured a notable 113 votes, outpacing Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, who managed to garner 99 votes. Prior to this vote, House Republicans had deliberated and eventually voted against a motion that proposed elevating the threshold for electing the House speaker to 217 votes, amounting to a majority of the conference.

This unfolding of events comes in the wake of the unanticipated ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. McCarthy's removal marked an unparalleled moment in American political history, as it was the first occasion the U.S. House of Representatives made the collective decision to unseat its leader. Eight members of McCarthy's party, in tandem with all House Democrats, catalyzed his fall from grace.

As the scramble to fill the speaker vacancy intensified, the spotlight inevitably narrowed down to two frontrunners: Scalise and Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio. Scalise, a seasoned political figure, has been recognized as McCarthy's right-hand man for a significant duration, notwithstanding the simmering rivalry that exists between the pair.

In contrast, Jordan, known for his closer ties to McCarthy, initially received an outpouring of support from influential conservatives within the GOP. Key figures like House Freedom Caucus Policy Chair Chip Roy, a Republican representative from Texas, openly endorsed Jordan. It's worth noting that Jordan's political career boasts of being a co-founder of the influential House Freedom Caucus group.

The political realm, as it stands, is rife with conjecture and anticipation regarding the future of the House's leadership. As tensions simmer and factions within the GOP rally behind their preferred candidates, the stage is set for a monumental showdown in the race for the House Speaker position.

In a chilling announcement, the Palestinian Hamas terror group, simply known as Hamas, has urged Muslims globally to mark a "Day of Jihad" on Friday, October 13th. Strikingly, this date is commonly associated with horror movies and the popular Halloween holiday, further deepening concerns about the group's intentions.

Dubbing the day as "Al-Aqsa Flood" Friday, Hamas recalls their past operation, which resulted in the death of over 1,200 Israelis, leaving approximately 3,000 injured and more than 100 kidnapped. 

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), in its report, cites Hamas stating: 

> "We declare next Friday, 'The Friday of the Al-Aqsa Flood,' as a day of general mobilization in our Arab and Islamic world and among the free people of the world. It is a day to rally support, offer aid, and participate actively. It is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation, isolate it, and foil all its aggressive schemes."

Hamas continues to stress the importance of the day as an opportunity to express profound love for Palestine, Jerusalem, and Al-Aqsa, urging it to be a day of sacrifice, heroism, and dedication.

Hamas has further beckoned Palestinians in the West Bank (which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria) to rise against Israeli forces. Moreover, they appeal to Arab citizens residing in Israel, referring to them as "our people within the occupied territories of 1948", to rebel against the state.

In popular culture, particularly in the entertainment sector, Friday the 13th has long been a day linked with horror, often chosen for the launch of horror film releases, captivating audiences with fictional tales of terror. However, the atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel paint a stark and grim reality, far from fiction.

It remains to be seen how the world will react to this ominous call to arms on a day already shrouded in superstition and horror. The global community must remain vigilant and united in the face of such threats, ensuring peace and security for all.
