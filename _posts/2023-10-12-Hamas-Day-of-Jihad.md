In a chilling announcement, the Palestinian Hamas terror group, simply known as Hamas, has urged Muslims globally to mark a "Day of Jihad" on Friday, October 13th. Strikingly, this date is commonly associated with horror movies and the popular Halloween holiday, further deepening concerns about the group's intentions.

Dubbing the day as "Al-Aqsa Flood" Friday, Hamas recalls their past operation, which resulted in the death of over 1,200 Israelis, leaving approximately 3,000 injured and more than 100 kidnapped. 

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), in its report, cites Hamas stating: 

> "We declare next Friday, 'The Friday of the Al-Aqsa Flood,' as a day of general mobilization in our Arab and Islamic world and among the free people of the world. It is a day to rally support, offer aid, and participate actively. It is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation, isolate it, and foil all its aggressive schemes."

Hamas continues to stress the importance of the day as an opportunity to express profound love for Palestine, Jerusalem, and Al-Aqsa, urging it to be a day of sacrifice, heroism, and dedication.

Hamas has further beckoned Palestinians in the West Bank (which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria) to rise against Israeli forces. Moreover, they appeal to Arab citizens residing in Israel, referring to them as "our people within the occupied territories of 1948", to rebel against the state.

In popular culture, particularly in the entertainment sector, Friday the 13th has long been a day linked with horror, often chosen for the launch of horror film releases, captivating audiences with fictional tales of terror. However, the atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel paint a stark and grim reality, far from fiction.

It remains to be seen how the world will react to this ominous call to arms on a day already shrouded in superstition and horror. The global community must remain vigilant and united in the face of such threats, ensuring peace and security for all.
