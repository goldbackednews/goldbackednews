Country music's rising star, Oliver Anthony, recently made waves not only for his music but also for taking a firm stance on affordable concert ticket prices. He cancelled an upcoming performance in Knoxville, Tennessee, in response to the venue's alleged sharp ticket price increase.

Last month, Anthony was catapulted into the spotlight after his politically-infused track, "Rich Men North of Richmond," became an internet sensation.

Addressing the issue, Anthony voiced his disappointment on Facebook, explaining his intentions for keeping his shows budget-friendly. "These are supposed to be affordable shows," he emphasized, adding, "It's also horses--- that they're charging extra for VIP meet and greet. Those are supposed to be free."

In an age of exorbitant concert ticket prices, Anthony's commitment to affordability is refreshing. Moreover, he shed light on allegations made by the venue, Cotton Eyed Joe, which claimed Anthony was demanding $120,000 for his performance. 

Setting the record straight, the singer detailed, "The most I've ever made on a show is $35,000. We've done two shows in NC that were completely free, and have another free show scheduled September 23rd in Kentucky for a cancer benefit."

While Anthony expressed his frustrations with the venue's alleged misleading claims, he also acknowledged his responsibility in the matter. "All the fault ultimately is with me. I should have been more thoroughly involved in the booking, and I should probably consider using a professional consultant in this area," he admitted.

But fans of the country sensation need not be dismayed. Oliver Anthony has already arranged an alternate venue for his performance in Knoxville. He recently announced a new concert date at the Knoxville Convention Center on September 29, promising an affordable and fun-filled evening for his supporters.

It's not every day that artists prioritize their fans over potential earnings, and Oliver Anthony's actions are a testament to his dedication to his fanbase. His genuine concern and proactive response are sure to earn him even more respect and loyalty in the country music community.
