President Joe Biden openly recognized on Thursday that the Democrats' flagship Inflation Reduction Act was not as much about curbing the country's then-record-high inflation as he had previously promoted.

In a candid revelation at a campaign fundraiser in Park City, Utah, Biden remarked, "I wish I hadn’t called it that. It has less to do with reducing inflation than it does providing for alternatives that generate economic growth."

Despite its nomenclature, the President highlighted the Act's pivotal role in lessening people's costs related to essential needs. "Even when there is inflation there is a way to provide breathing room," he said, exemplifying the negotiation of medical prices.

This stance is notably divergent from his previous comments in July 2022. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act's approval by Congress, Biden had described it as a robust solution to combat inflation. "The Inflation Reduction Act is the strongest bill you can pass. It will lower inflation, cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crisis, and promote energy security," he asserted then.

However, as the nation grappled with inflation rates approaching a 40-year peak, multiple analyses had already suggested the bill would not have the anticipated deflationary effect. The Congressional Budget Office predicted only a "negligible effect" of the bill on inflation in 2022, forecasting its impact in 2023 to range from a 0.1% reduction to a 0.1% increase.

As of now, the White House has not provided any comments to Fox News Digital regarding this matter.
