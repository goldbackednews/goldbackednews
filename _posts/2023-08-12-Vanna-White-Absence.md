In an unexpected twist for fans, Vanna White will be missing from five upcoming episodes of "Wheel of Fortune." It's noteworthy not just because she's a beloved figure on the show, but because this marks the first time she has missed an episode in 30 years.

The reason behind White's absence? Illness struck her during the recording of the show's special "Teachers Week." Logistical issues, particularly with the start of the new academic year, prevented the taping from being rescheduled. To uphold the show's teaching theme, the producers invited Bridgette Donald-Blue, named the 2023 California Teacher of the Year, to fill in for White while she recuperates.

Though White has been with "Wheel of Fortune" for 41 years, she's only been absent three times. The first instance was in 1986 due to the tragic passing of her boyfriend, John Gibson, in a plane crash. Susan Stafford replaced her then. The second time was in 1991 when she took a two-week honeymoon break with then-husband George Santo Pietro, with Tricia Gist stepping in. Gist filled in again later that same year when White fell ill.

White's upcoming episodes off-air come amid significant changes for the show. Longtime host Pat Sajak recently announced his retirement, with TV personality Ryan Seacrest being named his successor.

Contract renewal negotiations between White and "Wheel of Fortune" are ongoing. Reports suggest that White, who reportedly last received a pay hike almost 20 years ago, is asking for a pay raise. As of her last contract, White earns an annual $3 million, whereas Sajak's compensation was pegged at $15 million annually in 2016, as per Forbes.

White's dedication to "Wheel of Fortune" has been unwavering since 1982. She briefly assumed hosting duties in 2019 while Sajak underwent emergency surgery. Meanwhile, Maggie Sajak, Pat's daughter, took over White's duties during that period and later transitioned to a social media correspondent role for the show in 2021.

With Vanna White being such an iconic part of the show for nearly four decades, her brief absence will undoubtedly be felt by both her colleagues and dedicated viewers.
