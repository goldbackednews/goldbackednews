A flurry of criticisms and apprehensions have followed the recent appointment of U.S. prosecutor David Weiss as special counsel in the Hunter Biden investigation. The move has especially prompted a wave of condemnations from House Republicans, including from the moderate factions of the GOP.

This significant development was instigated by Attorney General Merrick Garland's decision to place Weiss at the helm of the “ongoing investigation” related to Hunter Biden. The remit of this investigation also encompasses "any other matters that arose or may arise" as a result.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) articulated a sentiment of cautious optimism by expressing hopes that Weiss will unveil the truth about the financial transactions of Hunter Biden and discern if any financial benefits were conferred upon President Biden. The Congressman remarked, “How many LLCs were formed to disguise the money flow? Despite the President's denial of involvement, evidence suggests he was part of approximately 20 phone conversations. It's crucial that the Special Counsel unveils the truth.”

Yet, the same Rep. Bacon also flagged his apprehensions, noting Weiss’s earlier recommendation of a "sweetheart deal" for Hunter, a proposal that was later overruled by the judge.

Drawing attention to this specific issue, Weiss's office was instrumental in crafting the plea deal for Hunter Biden in relation to his firearm and tax legal quandaries. Nevertheless, this plea was rebuffed by Judge Maryellen Norieka. Reports from NBC News intimate that this case is presumably heading towards trial, given the evident disconnect between federal prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal representatives.

Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY) voiced his skepticism more bluntly, denouncing Weiss’s appointment as “a manifest effort to obscure escalating evidence.” He cast aspersions on the motivations behind Attorney General Garland's decision and accused the Biden Justice Department of attempting to hinder congressional examination into perceived misconducts.

Amid these waves of criticisms, it's also highlighted that Weiss's prior solicitation to be named as a special counsel was declined, as per testimonies from an IRS whistleblower.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) mirrored the concerns of his GOP colleagues, questioning the integrity of Weiss’s appointment and emphasizing its potential to "obstruct congressional investigations."

Joel Pollak of Breitbart News pointed out a significant procedural anomaly. He asserts that the appointment of Weiss as a special counsel may be in violation of federal laws, primarily because he was not sourced from outside the governmental structure.

The repercussions of Weiss's appointment, both in the investigative domain and political arena, remain to be seen. But what's unequivocal is the mounting scrutiny and heated debates it has ignited.
