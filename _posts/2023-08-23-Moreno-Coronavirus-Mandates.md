Bernie Moreno, a pro-Donald Trump businessman and GOP Senate candidate, is staunchly opposing the resurgence of coronavirus mandates, terming them as “tyrannical” and clashing with core American values of freedom and liberty.

**Setting The Record Straight**

Moreno, aiming to challenge Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in the 2024 elections, used a video message to share his uncompromising stance on the matter. He emphasized the need for Republicans to draw a clear boundary against the return of these measures. Moreno boldly stated that any school reintroducing mask or vaccine mandates should face federal funding cuts, and corporations enforcing such guidelines should be deprived of government contracts.

>Highlighting the prolonged battle against the pandemic, Moreno expressed his exasperation at seeing the revival of mandates which he believed were things of the past.

**Resisting Mandates - A Core Reason for Entering Politics**

Recalling his consistent resistance against such impositions from the start, Moreno revealed that one of his primary motivations to run for public office was the fight against these mandates. He views them as fundamentally at odds with American values of freedom and liberty.

Moreno’s passionate plea is not just words. The businessman promises that if elected as a Senator, he will ardently oppose such mandates, including withholding funds from tertiary institutions enforcing student vaccination and masking. Corporate entities partnering with the federal government won’t be spared either, as Moreno plans to ensure that they don't get taxpayer dollars if they impose such mandates.

**The Larger Political Implications**

As the 2024 election year approaches, the Biden administration’s renewed emphasis on coronavirus measures is raising eyebrows. Speculation is rife about potential political motivations behind such a push, with many seeing parallels to the 2020 election year’s focus on Covid-19.

>Election dynamics further add to the intrigue. The upcoming election in Ohio is anticipated to be a turbulent affair, especially given that Brown is seen as one of the vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election. Out of the 33 Senate seats vying for re-election in 2024, Democrats or left-leaning independents currently hold 23, making the landscape particularly challenging for them.

**A Continued Commitment to Change**

Beyond the current controversy, Moreno's political journey has been noteworthy. Despite a halted bid in 2022 after consultations with former President Donald Trump, Moreno remains undeterred. His commitment to reshaping the political scene in Washington is evident. In a candid conversation with Breitbart News, he emphasized that he wasn't someone the Republican establishment could easily control or influence.

As the political scene heats up, Moreno's fiery stances are sure to stir debates and discussions, both within Ohio and across the nation.
