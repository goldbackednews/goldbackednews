The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of Johnny Hardwick, the acclaimed voice actor renowned for his portrayal of Dale Gribble in the popular animated series "King of the Hill." At the age of 64, Hardwick's demise has left many in shock.

The distressing news was confirmed by the Austin (Texas) Police Department, which attended a welfare check on Tuesday, leading to the tragic discovery of Hardwick's lifeless body. While the circumstances surrounding his death are still shrouded in mystery, the Austin police have categorically stated that it isn't a homicide case. Further details pertaining to the cause will be unveiled once the Travis County Medical Examiner finalizes their findings.

Hardwick's role as Dale Gribble began in 1997 with the show's premiere episode and lasted until its conclusion in 2010, spanning an impressive 259 episodes. His outstanding contribution to "King of the Hill" earned him an Emmy Award in 1999, followed by nominations in 2001 and 2002. The animated masterpiece was the brainchild of creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, with a cast ensemble including talents like Judge himself, Kathy Najimy, Stephen Root, and Pamela Adlon.

Earlier this year, fans rejoiced upon learning about a forthcoming revival of "King of the Hill," with Hardwick's involvement confirmed. Craig Erwich, the executive at the helm of ABC Entertainment, Hulu, and Disney Branded Television Streaming Originals, expressed enthusiasm about resuming the show's narrative to reflect on our contemporary world.

Beyond his notable voice acting career, Hardwick was also a gifted stand-up comedian, making a mark in the comedy circuits during the 1990s.
