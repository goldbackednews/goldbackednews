President Joe Biden has taken a definitive stance on discussions regarding his son Hunter Biden's legal challenges within the White House, according to recent reports. The president appears to be distancing himself from most aides who bring forth suggestions or insights about Hunter's legal predicaments.

The Delaware court, earlier this week, formalized the dismissal of the tax and gun plea deal concerning Hunter Biden. However, Special Counsel David Weiss, who was appointed recently, is determined to progress with the case by taking it to trial.

According to a [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com) article from Thursday, most White House personnel are cautious about bringing up Hunter's legal woes in discussions with the president. The sentiment stems from a belief that their input might not be warmly received. The report, based on inputs from multiple present and former officials from the administration, mentioned that only a select group of the president's longtime, trusted aides engage in dialogues concerning such family-related issues.

A previous report from NBC News in June suggested that President Biden was deeply involved with the scandals surrounding his son. It even reported instances where he curtly dismissed aides who hinted that Hunter Biden's contentious past might cast a political shadow over his presidency. One stark remark from the president to an aide was reported as, "Hands off my family."

An associate close to the president supposedly remarked, "This is the reality of their family ethos."

Hunter's plea deal, which allowed him to plead guilty to evading taxes on over $1.5 million of earnings from 2017 and 2018 in exchange for probation instead of incarceration, fell apart under judicial scrutiny. Additionally, Weiss had prepared a separate diversion agreement that promised Hunter immunity from probable future indictments.

On the day of the plea deal's disintegration, White House officials purposefully kept the president's calendar sparse, allowing him to closely follow his son's hearing. The Post detailed that there was palpable relief among the aides, given that the collapse of the plea deal meant an extension of Hunter's legal challenges.

Further emphasizing the closed-door nature of the matter, many White House aides were reportedly unaware that Hunter and his family had been residing in the White House for a fortnight earlier in the summer.
