In a glaring testament to President Biden's ineptitude on the immigration front, even Democrats from historically blue states are voicing their criticism. Notably, tensions between Biden and blue state Democrats have soared amidst the unyielding flow of migrants, largely exacerbated by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's migrant bussing program.

Leading the charge against Biden's immigration shortcomings, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has openly censured the Biden administration. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, evidently frustrated, has been consistently urging Biden for more action. As if this was not damning enough, other Democratic bastions such as Chicago and Boston are also struggling, imploring the administration for intervention.

It's alarming when stalwarts from the President's party, like Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., are reaching out, hoping for more action from the White House. "I wrote to him in May, so it's been like four months. But I hope to find out," Durbin revealed to Axios.

>Blue state leaders are essentially begging for more substantial federal support.

It's not just political figures. Business magnates from NYC, including influential figures from JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, penned an open letter to Biden and Congress. Their plea? More federal funds for migrant care. The message was crystal clear: local and state governments are bearing the financial brunt, with abysmally scant federal aid.

The primary ask from these Democrats? Expedite work permits to enable migrants to fend for themselves, alleviating the burden on city and state infrastructures. But Biden's response? A lukewarm attempt at streamlining permits for a fraction of migrants - an effort glaringly insufficient for cities like New York and Chicago.

Migrants, traditionally, are not allowed to work upon illegal entry. Work eligibility surfaces only after asylum applications, but even that process is lengthy. However, what Adams and Hochul are clamoring for goes beyond this. They seek a federal emergency declaration that would not only increase funding but also pave the way for widespread permitting.

Mayor Adams, voicing the sentiments of many, recently stated, "We need people to have the right to work... We need an emergency declaration." His words underscore the administration's sheer inadequacy in both preventing and intervening in the crisis.

In a nutshell, Biden's immigration policies (or the lack thereof) have not only infuriated the opposition but also those from his own party. It's high time the administration takes cognizance and acts responsibly.
