In the latest political drama to unfold, Former President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to take legal action against Pennsylvania's move towards automatic voter registration, initiated by Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro.

## Pennsylvania Joins the Fray
Governor Shapiro's attempt to position Pennsylvania among states with automatic voter registration has sparked considerable controversy. He asserts he can implement this without new legislation, claiming it is within the state’s current legal framework.

## Trump’s Strong Opposition
Trump, never one to shy away from vocalizing his opposition, took to Truth Social, expressing his vehement disagreement with the move. "Start suing now, & get the right lawyers this time!" he wrote, regarding what he perceives as a disastrous and unconstitutional act that threatens the election of Republicans, including himself.

Trump perceives this shift as a way for "Marxists, & Fascists," to cheat on elections, and potentially detrimental to the Republican hold in key battleground states.

## The Political Tug of War
Twenty-three states, including Washington, D.C., already have automatic voter registration. This new methodology being adopted by predominantly blue states or key battleground regions seems to be a new strategy by Democrats, causing a shift in traditional voter registration norms.

In Pennsylvania, Shapiro’s administration is making voter registration more accessible, tying it to obtaining or renewing a driver's license. This move means individuals are presented with the opportunity to register to vote more directly when they interact with driver's license centers.

## The Crux of the Matter
States have been obligated to offer voter registration at driver's license centers since 1993 when the National Voter Registration Act was passed. The bone of contention, therefore, isn’t about offering registration but about the method of offering it. The contention arises from the transition to automatic prompts for voter registration, compared to the previous method where individuals were first asked if they wanted to register.

## The Larger Picture
Trump’s call for legal action is similar to his 2020 opposition to mass mail-in ballots. He views this as another attempt by Democrats to alter election dynamics in their favor. The former President’s remarks aimed at his chief GOP primary rivals, including former Vice President Mike Pence and others, show the internal and external battle lines being drawn over this issue.

## In a Nutshell
This dramatic development in Pennsylvania is a sign of the continuous political tension and the constant struggle between Republicans and Democrats over voter registration and election fairness. It opens a new chapter in the ongoing debate over the integrity and accessibility of the voting process in America, with each side accusing the other of attempting to manipulate the system for their advantage.
