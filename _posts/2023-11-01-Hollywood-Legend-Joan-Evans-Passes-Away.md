Joan Evans, a luminary of the Hollywood's Golden Age and star of classics such as "On the Loose" and "Skirts Ahoy!," has passed away at the venerable age of 89. The actress's son, John Weatherly, confirmed her passing, which occurred at her home in Henderson, Nevada on October 21.

Evans’ journey in the entertainment world was nothing short of remarkable. As the goddaughter of the legendary Joan Crawford, she was destined for stardom from a young age. Her parents, Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert, were both well-established screenwriters, penning the script for "On the Loose," one of Evans' most memorable films.

The 1950s saw Evans rise to prominence, starring alongside Esther Williams in the 1952 musical hit "Skirts Ahoy!" and delivering compelling performances in "Edge of Doom," "Our Very Own," "Column South," and "No Name on the Bullet." Her acting prowess and on-screen charm captivated audiences, making her a household name and a beloved figure in Hollywood.

Born in New York in 1934, Evans' mother served as a Hollywood reporter for Photoplay magazine, often covering Crawford’s rising career. This close-knit relationship between Evans’ family and Crawford played a significant role in shaping her life and career. "They were best friends," Evans recalled in a 2013 interview with Foster Hirsch.

Evans’ journey, however, was not without its trials. She shared a harrowing experience from the set of "Roseanna McCoy" in 1948, where she was accidentally shot in the arm, requiring emergency surgery and a hospital stay. This incident, while traumatic, showcased Evans' resilience and determination, traits that defined her both on and off the screen.

Evans' personal life was as captivating as her film career. At a dinner party hosted by Crawford, she and Kirby Weatherly decided to tie the knot, a spontaneous decision that resulted in a midnight wedding officiated by a judge Crawford had called over. Evans and Weatherly’s marriage stood the test of time, lasting until his death on January 1, 2023.

Reflecting on her relationship with Crawford, Evans spoke warmly of the star, remembering her as a “wonderful, darling friend” and debunking the myth of the diva actress. The bond between Evans and Crawford remained strong until Crawford’s death in 1977, a testament to their enduring friendship.

Joan Evans leaves behind a legacy of cinematic excellence, personal resilience, and a life well-lived. She is survived by her son, John, daughter, Dale, and grandson, Chris. As we bid farewell to this Golden Age icon, we celebrate her contributions to the world of film and remember her as a shining star in Hollywood's illustrious history.
