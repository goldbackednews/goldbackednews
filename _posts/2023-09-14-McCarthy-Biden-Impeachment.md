In a significant political move, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is set to advocate for an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Labeling it as the “logical next step”, McCarthy aims to rally the GOP's support in a formal investigation into the numerous allegations against the Biden family.

**Leadership Meeting to Decide the Path Forward**

During an 8 AM closed-door leadership session scheduled for Thursday, McCarthy will brief fellow House Republicans on the findings by House Oversight Committee Chair Jamie Comer (R-KY) and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH). These findings, as reported by Punchbowl News, are believed to be substantial enough to warrant a formalized impeachment inquiry to secure the Bidens’ bank records and other pivotal documents.

However, gaining the necessary 218 House Republicans' support for this inquiry might be a tall order. Several moderate Republicans, such as Reps. Ken Buck (Colo.) and Don Bacon (Neb.), have voiced their doubts regarding the necessity of an impeachment inquiry. Buck, speaking to MSNBC, stated, “The time for impeachment is the time when there’s evidence linking President Biden — if there’s evidence linking President Biden — to a high crime or misdemeanor. That doesn’t exist right now.” Furthermore, Bacon told Politico, “As of now I don’t support [an impeachment inquiry]. An inquiry should be based on evidence of a crime that points directly to President Biden..."

**Growing Support and Allegations**

Contrarily, many GOP members appear to be in favor of an impeachment inquiry. As Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) pointed out to CNN, the primary purpose of the inquiry would be to gather more evidence. She emphasized the need for transparency, stating, "Any piece of evidence, right or wrong, I want the American people to see all of it, whether it backs us up or not.”

The myriad of accusations against Joe Biden range from photographs, texts, videos, audio recordings, and various testimonies. These include:
- Biden family suspicious activity reports regarding wire transfers.
- Numerous pieces of communication, including emails, texts, and WhatsApp messages.
- Allegations from former business partners, including references to Joe Biden as the “big guy.”
- A multitude of whistleblower testimonies.
- Video clips showcasing Joe Biden discussing the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor.
- Allegations related to Biden family's financial transactions.

Recent CNN survey data illustrates a split perception among Americans. 61% believe Joe Biden was involved in his family’s business dealings with China and Ukraine, while only 38% consider him uninvolved. A meager 1% believe he was involved but acted without any wrongdoing.

The proposed impeachment inquiry, if green-lighted, is poised to significantly shape the political landscape. Whether it unearths groundbreaking revelations or serves as another political maneuver remains to be seen.
