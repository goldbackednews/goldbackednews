San Cristobal, a city near one of the busiest airports in the Dominican Republic, was plunged into chaos following a catastrophic explosion at a bakery. The incident, which occurred on Monday, led to the tragic death of at least three individuals, including a 4-month-old infant. Reports indicate that another 39 people sustained injuries as they frantically attempted to escape the unfolding disaster.

Dominican Republic President, Luis Abinader, expressed his sorrow over the incident on X, the platform formerly recognized as Twitter. He stated, "Sorry about what happened in San Cristóbal. From the first moment, we are attending to the victims and their families. In coordination with the local authorities, we will work on the total recovery of the area."

The precise cause of the afternoon explosion remains unknown. However, it has been confirmed that the blast set off a substantial fire that spread swiftly, engulfing a neighboring hardware and furniture store. The location, popularly termed the "Old Marketplace," witnesses large gatherings of locals shopping for a variety of goods, from fresh produce to apparel.

Among the deceased were a 4-month-old child who succumbed to a severe head injury, and two adults with 90% of their bodies burned. The National Health Service's Dr. Mario Lama disclosed these details. Additionally, a local bank has verified the death of a female employee in the explosion's aftermath.

Pictures captured post-explosion reveal firefighters combating the blaze amidst vast rubble, engulfing dust, and billowing smoke. Burned-out vehicles were also spotted lining the street where the explosion took place.

Joel Santos, the Minister of the Presidency, during a press conference on Monday, emphasized, "Our main objective here has been to safeguard the greatest number of human lives."

According to The Associated Press, the death toll might escalate, prompting authorities to evacuate the vicinity, fearing additional building collapses. "These buildings are very weak," was the warning sounded by legislator Franklin Rodríguez.

Local representative, Eddy Montás, in a conversation with Noticias SIN, revealed witnessing a few bodies in the area, over and above the three officially announced casualties.

With the weight of this tragedy pressing down, the community grieves their loss, apprehensive of the aftermath yet to unfold.
