Amid the rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, a bipartisan panel appointed by Congress has sounded the alarm: the United States must bolster its defense mechanisms in readiness for potential simultaneous conflicts with Russia and China.

The findings, presented by the Strategic Posture Commission, come in the wake of escalating tensions. With China's assertiveness over Taiwan and Russia's controversial invasion of Ukraine, the international scene is heating up. Although no clear evidence indicates active nuclear cooperation between China and Russia, there are concerns of potential strategic coordination.

This report's implications are immense. It essentially challenges the current US national security strategy, which revolves around deterring one conflict while winning another. Implementing the recommended changes would mean a considerable uptick in defense expenditure, the feasibility of which remains to be seen given the constraints of the congressional budget.

Acknowledging the financial implications, the report's preface, penned by Democratic chair Madelyn Creedon, and vice-chair Jon Kyl, underscores the nation's need for these investments. During the report's release, Kyl further emphasized the importance of rallying public support for increased defense spending, arguing that it's a minimal price for potentially averting a full-blown nuclear war involving the major players: the US, China, and Russia.

These findings starkly contrast with President Joe Biden's stance, which leans towards the sufficiency of the current US nuclear arsenal in deterring combined threats from Russia and China. Responses from advocacy groups like the Arms Control Association echo this sentiment, suggesting that the existing arsenal already surpasses deterrent needs.

However, the Strategic Posture Commission remains firm: to uphold the values of the U.S.-led international order, the nation and its allies must be adequately equipped to deter and overcome both adversaries.

Created in 2022, this panel of equal Democratic and Republican representation set out to evaluate long-term threats and suggest modifications in the US's defense approach. Their evaluation warns of the acute threats from China and Russia, especially between 2027-2035. As China expands its nuclear arsenal – projected to reach 1,500 warheads by 2035 – the US faces the challenge of contending with two primary nuclear adversaries.

The 145-page report is comprehensive, advocating for the complete funding of the 30-year US nuclear arms modernization program initiated in 2010. Among the many recommendations, it pushes for the deployment of increased tactical nuclear weapons across Asia and Europe, more B-21 stealth bombers, new Columbia-class nuclear submarines, and consideration for deploying reserve US nuclear warheads.

The ultimate takeaway? The US needs to amplify the "size, type, and posture" of its conventional forces in collaboration with allies. Without these enhancements, the nation might find itself leaning heavily on its nuclear arsenal – a situation the world would be better off avoiding.
