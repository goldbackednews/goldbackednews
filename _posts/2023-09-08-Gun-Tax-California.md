The winds of change are blowing on Capitol Hill as freshman House Republican, Rep. John James of Michigan, proposes a groundbreaking resolution. Aimed at establishing an upper age limit for holding federal elected offices, the proposal calls for constitutional amendment considerations.

Presently, there are age criteria to meet to run for president, vice president, or Congress. However, these are minimum age requirements. Rep. James's resolution addresses the other end of the spectrum, stipulating that no one could run for these roles if they would turn 75 or older during their term. The rationale? Adapting to an ever-changing world.

>"The world's not getting slower, it's getting faster. The world's not getting safer, it's getting more dangerous," James shared with Fox News Digital. "We have a lower bound; it just makes sense to have an upper bound."

This proposal comes amid rising concerns regarding the age and health of some prominent politicians. Top names like Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and even President Biden have faced public scrutiny regarding their fitness to serve.

James took a direct stance, expressing concerns not just for internal governance but also for how the nation is perceived externally. "You can't watch a video of Feinstein or McConnell or Biden and tell me that everything's OK," he commented. "America has lost a step."

While many might view this as a controversial move, James points out that the Founding Fathers never envisioned lifetime tenures in the legislature. His perspective echoes a need for periodic refreshment and rejuvenation of the political landscape.

It's worth noting that implementing such a significant change won't be easy or swift. Constitutional amendments require broad consensus, needing two-thirds approval from both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.

James's resolution forms part of a broader government accountability package he's championing. Other propositions include service time caps in Congress and withholding congressional pay during government shutdowns.

While the future of these resolutions remains uncertain, they surely underscore a fresh wave of thought, emphasizing adaptability, accountability, and the nation's future preparedness.

**California's Unsettling Move: Taxing the Right to Bear Arms**

In a move many see as an affront to the Second Amendment, the California Senate audaciously approved an 11% tax on guns and ammunition. This legislation, which now returns to the state assembly for another vote, may soon find its way to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for final approval.

**A Masked Deterrent to Gun Ownership?**

Proposed by Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, this tax appears to be more than a mere revenue-generating endeavor. On the surface, it is touted as a mechanism to enhance "school safety." However, the specifics on how this tax directly ensures such safety remain conspicuously ambiguous. The underlying message seems clear: make gun ownership more expensive, thus discouraging citizens from exercising their constitutionally protected right.

**Concerns Overreach**

While California prides itself on being progressive, there's a thin line between progression and overreach. The state's already rigid gun laws restrict K-12 educators from bearing arms for the protection of their students. Additionally, concealed carry permit holders face prohibitions against arming themselves on college campuses. With this tax, is California subtly trying to price out the average citizen's access to their Second Amendment rights?

California Rifle and Pistol Association President, Chuck Michel, emphatically voiced his concerns, dubbing the move a “poll tax” and likening it to taxing a fundamental constitutional right. Highlighting the gravity of the issue, Michel declared, “We’re going to have to file a lawsuit to challenge it.”

**A Future Under Threat?**

As the legislation makes its final journey through the state assembly, it serves as a stark reminder of the continuous challenges faced by the Second Amendment. This isn’t merely a debate about a tax; it’s a dialogue about the sanctity of our constitutional rights. If a foundational right can be taxed, what does that spell for the future of our freedoms?
