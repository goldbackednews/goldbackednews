House Republicans are in a heated debate, introducing competing amendments to the House GOP rules, underlining the division within the party as they gear up to elect their new speaker.

At the heart of the matter, Rep. Chip Roy proposed an amendment that raises the bar for nominating a speaker candidate, setting the requirement at 217 votes â€“ equivalent to a House majority. This initiative comes in light of the memory of Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's lengthy 15-round election journey to acquire the gavel earlier in the year.

Supporters of this amendment argue its merit, suggesting that it's a pivotal step towards preventing future internal battles from taking the center stage, and ensuring greater unity within the House GOP.

However, the rule hasn't been met with unanimous approval. Rep. Tom McClintock, another significant Republican figure, labeled Roy's proposal as "an absurdity on its face." He emphasized the flaw in the existing process of ousting a speaker, which allows for the removal of the chosen speaker by merely a handful of disgruntled members. McClintock voiced his concern in strong terms, stating that such a system amounts to "childish despotism and utter nonsense."

In response, McClintock proposed an alternative: any member going against the collective decision of the conference on procedural matters, including speaker votes and rule changes, should face expulsion. To readmit such an expelled member, a two-thirds majority of the conference would have to vote in favor.

Interestingly, amidst these swirling controversies, there have been calls to bring back McCarthy as the speaker. However, the chances of that happening seem slim, given McCarthy's own expressed disinclination to reclaim the position.

As of now, all eyes are on Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, the two major contenders for the speaker's position. House Republicans are geared up to hear their pitches and are expected to convene again to finalize their decision on the next speaker.

The ongoing disagreements underscore the challenges that lie ahead for the GOP as they attempt to showcase unity and strength in these politically tumultuous times.
