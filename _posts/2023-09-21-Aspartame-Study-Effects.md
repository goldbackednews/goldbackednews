Aspartame, a widespread zero-calorie sweetener, is making headlines again. A study from Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine indicates potential links between the sweetener and memory or learning challenges.

## Unpacking the Study

Researchers from FSU carried out a 16-week experiment on mice. Three groups were set up:

1. One consumed 15% of the FDAâ€™s daily recommended maximum intake of aspartame (like drinking four 8-oz. sodas).
2. The second group had 7% of the recommended maximum (equivalent to two 8-oz. sodas daily).
3. A control group only drank water.

Throughout the experiment, the mice underwent maze tests. The results? Mice that consumed water found their way out much quicker than their aspartame-drinking counterparts. Those consuming aspartame did finish, but they struggled and often needed extra assistance.

## Findings and Concerns

The study's co-author, Pradeep Bhide, shed light on the emotional connection between memory and learning. He emphasized the unique nature of the findings, pointing out that only the children (and not the grandchildren) of the male mice showed these effects. This suggests epigenetic changes in the sperm might be responsible.

With these results in mind, Bhide proposed a more in-depth, multi-generational investigation of aspartame by the FDA.

Earlier in June, the World Health Organization made waves by categorizing aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic to humans". While industry experts refuted this claim, the WHO hasn't touched on the cognitive implications highlighted by FSU's recent findings.

Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a Washington, D.C.-based medical toxicology physician, weighed in. She remarked on the study's implications: potential hereditary memory and learning problems stemming from even minimal aspartame consumption. But she also added a note of caution, stating more research is necessary to firmly establish this connection.

## To Drink or Not to Drink?

Industry leaders have stepped forward to defend aspartame. The Calorie Control Council's president, Robert Rankin, emphasized that the study's results should not be generalized to humans. He cited the vast body of evidence and global health organizations that deem aspartame safe after rigorous evaluations.

While the debate rages on, the FSU study has certainly added a new layer to the conversation surrounding artificial sweeteners and their potential effects. As research continues, consumers might consider limiting their intake or staying updated with the latest findings to make informed choices.
