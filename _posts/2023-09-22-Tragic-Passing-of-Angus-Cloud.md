Angus’s family released a statement expressing their profound grief and shared their hope that Angus's battle with mental health would serve as a reminder to others that they are not alone in their struggles.

He had discussed the complexities of playing such a role and had been open about bringing a lot of his own experiences and emotions to the character of Fezco. The show’s casting director, Jennifer Venditti, remarked that Angus did not "get enough credit" for the work he put into his role.
