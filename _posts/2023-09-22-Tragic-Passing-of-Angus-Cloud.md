The entertainment world is still coming to terms with the tragic loss of Angus Cloud, who shot to fame with his breakout role in the hit HBO series 'Euphoria'. Angus, also known as Conor Hickey, passed away on July 31 at the tender age of 25, leaving fans and fellow cast members grieving.

### Accidental Overdose and Unanswered Questions

Fox News Digital has confirmed that Angus's untimely death was the result of an accidental overdose.

Angus’s family released a statement expressing their profound grief and shared their hope that Angus's battle with mental health would serve as a reminder to others that they are not alone in their struggles. "Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence," the statement read.

### A Star with a Special Presence

Angus Cloud’s portrayal of Fezco, a high school dropout and drug dealer, was praised for its depth and authenticity. Despite the character’s rough exterior, Angus imbued Fezco with a sense of vulnerability and relatability, earning him adoration from fans and respect from colleagues.

Cloud's sudden rise to fame began when he was "plucked off the street" and cast in 'Euphoria'. He had discussed the complexities of playing such a role and had been open about bringing a lot of his own experiences and emotions to the character of Fezco. The show’s casting director, Jennifer Venditti, remarked that Angus did not "get enough credit" for the work he put into his role.

### Tributes Pour In

Angus’s passing saw an outpour of grief and love from co-stars, especially Zendaya, the lead actress of 'Euphoria'. Zendaya, in a heartfelt Instagram post, described Angus as a person of "infinite beauty" and expressed her gratitude for having known him. "I’m so grateful I got the chance to know him in this life, to call him a brother, to see his warm kind eyes and bright smile, or hear his infectious cackle of a laugh," she wrote.

### Remembering Angus

Angus Cloud leaves behind a legacy marked by talent, resilience, and an undeniable presence. His struggles underscore the pressing need for open discussions surrounding mental health and substance abuse, especially among young people in the limelight.
