In an effort to champion a more inclusive and diverse workspace, President Joe Biden's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rolled out a new mandate. The latest guidance instructs the department's considerable workforce of 80,000 to address transgender colleagues using their preferred pronouns.

The "Gender Identity and Non-Discrimination Guidance" disseminated recently emphasizes the respect and recognition every employee is entitled to, regarding their gender identity. A reported HHS communication to its personnel specified that coworkers must be referred to by the names and pronouns they personally identify with.

Complementing this, HHS Secretary Andrea Palm unveiled an “unlisted” video on YouTube emphasizing the essence of the policy. She underscores the department's commitment to fostering an environment where everyone feels valid, appreciated, and can present their genuine selves, irrespective of their gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability status. Yet, the stance on accommodating employees with religious objections to this new mandate remains ambiguous.

Admiral Rachel Levine, HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, who identifies as a transgender woman, is an ardent supporter of the policy. Levine stresses its pivotal role in ensuring all HHS personnel, inclusive of transgender and nonbinary individuals, experience a workplace devoid of discrimination. The onus of upholding and implementing this inclusive directive also rests on the department's supervisors and managers, Levine added.

However, this move has not been without its detractors. Roger Severino, who led the HHS Office for Civil Rights during Trump's tenure, censured the department, asserting that they are imposing "compelled speech" and supplanting scientific evidence with gender ideologies. Severino, currently serving as the vice president of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation, fears that this policy might be weaponized against Christian employees. He ardently argues that the First Amendment is under threat as the new policy seems to infringe on free speech and religious liberties.

The newly instituted policy goes beyond just pronoun usage. It allows employees the freedom to choose clothing and access restrooms aligning with their gender identity. Moreover, the policy advises overhauling the department's IT systems to reflect an employee's transgender status accurately.

While the new directive is hailed by many as a significant step toward fostering inclusion and diversity, questions remain. The primary concerns are the potential implications for free speech and the religious freedoms of employees. The HHS's future course of action and its response to these concerns will be pivotal in shaping the discourse on inclusivity, freedom of speech, and religion in the workplace.
