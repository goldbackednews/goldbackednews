Maryland's Circuit Court Judge Andrew Wilkinson from Hagerstown was brutally gunned down outside his home on Thursday evening. This tragic incident is believed to be a retaliatory act following a judgment in a divorce hearing.

Authorities from the Washington County Sheriff's Office quickly identified the prime suspect, Pedro Argote, who had a direct link to the judgment. Earlier that day, Judge Wilkinson had granted child custody to a woman amidst Argote's divorce proceedings. Interestingly, Argote was absent during the hearing.

"This wasn't random. It was a targeted attack on Judge Wilkinson," declared Washington County Sheriff Brian K. Albert in a press briefing on Friday. The sheriff's office has warned the public that Argote, 49, is still on the loose, armed, and could be dangerous. Notably, he is a legal owner of a firearm.

The violent episode took place post 8 p.m. on Olde Waterford Road in Hagerstown. Judge Wilkinson, 52 at the time of his death, was ambushed in his driveway while his wife and son were inside the house. He was rushed to Meritus Medical Center but was pronounced dead on arrival.

Records revealed that authorities had been previously called to Argote's residence on two separate occasions in response to "verbal domestic assaults." However, Pedro Argote had managed to maintain a clean slate, with no prior criminal record in Washington County.

Wilkinson's association with the 4th Judicial Circuit began in 2020. Born in Guam in 1971, the judge earned his credentials from the prestigious University of North Carolina and later, the Emory University School of Law.

While the hunt for Argote intensifies, Washington County court records have provided an intriguing insight: Judge Wilkinson had been overseeing Argote's divorce case since 2022. The next scheduled hearing was set for October 31st.

The alarming nature of the assassination raises concerns over the security of judiciary officials. However, the sheriff's office has clarified that there seems to be no ongoing threat to other judges in the vicinity.

This incident serves as a brutal reminder of the dangers public servants might face, emphasizing the need for heightened security measures and precautions.
