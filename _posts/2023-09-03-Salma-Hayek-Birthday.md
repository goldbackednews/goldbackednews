Salma Hayek, the renowned actress and beauty icon, showcased her ageless charm as she marked her 57th birthday on a sun-kissed beach, radiating positivity and gratitude. Adorning a striking red bikini with a fashionable hat and sunglasses, Hayek's exuberance was infectious.

Taking to Instagram, the star expressed her heartfelt feelings, saying, "I’m so happy to be alive and so profoundly grateful for all the blessings!!!!" Her sentiments encapsulated her appreciation for family, friends, her health, and her deep connection with nature.

Among the flood of well-wishers were A-list celebrities, with Oscar winners Viola Davis sending the "Happiest of birthdays" and Sir Anthony Hopkins extending a warm "Feliz Cumpleaños Salma. We love you." Priyanka Chopra-Jonas also chimed in, complimenting the birthday girl with, "Happy birthday gorgeous."

Behind the glam and the glitz, Hayek enjoys a beautiful personal life. She is married to the French businessman François-Henri Pinault, and together they share a 15-year-old daughter, Valentina. Hayek also plays a pivotal role in the lives of Pinault's other children.

Hayek's affinity for bikinis is no secret. Earlier in July, she took to social media to commemorate National Bikini Day, sharing a stunning photograph and commenting on the relatively short history of the bikini. Her caption resonated with her fun spirit, "Happy #NationalBikiniDay! Can you believe the bikini has only been around for 77 years?! Let’s hope they don’t ban them too."

Beyond her captivating photos and her accomplishments on screen, including her role in "Eternals," Hayek finds solace in the embrace of the ocean. Sharing her sense of renewal, she noted in April, "Every time I need to feel renewed I jump into the ocean."

As Salma Hayek celebrates another year around the sun, her zest for life, gratitude, and vivacity shine brightly, proving age is but a number.
