A somber Labor Day dawned for the city of Atlanta, as a tragic accident claimed the lives of five teenagers and left three others seriously injured.

**Grim Discovery on I-85**
Just as the city began to stir in the early hours of Labor Day, a devastating event unfolded on Interstate 85. At about 4 a.m., a 911 call alerted authorities to a horrific accident near Pleasant Hill Rd in Duluth, Georgia. A vehicle had plummeted "over the wall of the raised ramp," crashing into traffic lanes below.

Emergency personnel, upon arriving at the scene, were met with a harrowing sight. Five teenagers, ranging in age from 16 to 19, were pronounced dead at the spot, while three others suffered injuries and were immediately rushed to nearby hospitals.

**Victims Identified**
The hearts of many were heavy upon learning the identities of the deceased â€“ Katy Gaitan (17), Ashley Gaitan (16), Coral Lorenzo (17), Hung Nguyen (18), and Abner Santana (19). Tragically, three of them attended the same school, Lakeside High School in DeKalb County.

**Reconstructing the Events**
As investigators pieced together the tragic sequence of events, it emerged that two vehicles initially collided on the ramp. This crash sent one of the vehicles soaring over the wall, where it tragically landed on the interstate and was subsequently struck by another car, as per FOX 5 Atlanta.

Following this heartrending incident, traffic diversions were in place, with portions of the interstate, including the SR 316 WB ramps to I85 SB and Pleasant Hill Rd, being closed off.

As the city mourns the loss of its young souls, questions about ramp safety and vehicular accidents loom large, reminding everyone of the preciousness of life and the unpredictability of fate.
