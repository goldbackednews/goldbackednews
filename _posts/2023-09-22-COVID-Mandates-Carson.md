Ben Carson, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, raises the alarm on what he perceives as attempts by the U.S. government to control the American populace through mandates related to COVID-19. In a discussion on Newsmax's "American Agenda," he voiced concerns over the significant influence and control exercised by the authorities during the pandemic.

## The Impact on Education
Carson criticized the sweeping measures, such as school shutdowns, arguing they have had severe and long-lasting impacts on the learning and development of children. He believes it could take years, if not decades, for the educational setbacks experienced during the pandemic to be reversed. 

## Allegations of Manipulation
The former HUD Secretary accuses the government of not prioritizing the welfare of the citizens and focusing instead on controlling and manipulating people. He fears the grave implications if such practices continue and calls for a critical examination of the repercussions of the mandates imposed during the pandemic.

## Funding for At-Home COVID Tests
In response to the Biden administrationâ€™s recent announcement of a $600 million funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests, Carson emphasized the importance of not succumbing to fear and manipulation. This funding initiative is aimed at averting possible shortages during an anticipated rise in coronavirus cases during the colder months and resolving supply chain issues experienced during past surges.

## Carson's Clarion Call
Carson's strong message to the American people is to not be "manipulated and terrified by COVID." He urges rationality and an understanding of the facts surrounding the virus, such as its evolving, typically weaker variants. He warns against unnecessary fear due to increased positive test results and calls for resistance against any attempts to impose further business and school shutdowns which could lead to economic distress.

## We, The People
In conclusion, Carson's plea is for vigilance and a unified stance by the people against government overreach and control. He emphasizes that it is the collective responsibility of the citizens to assert their rights and safeguard their freedoms against any perceived attempts to disrupt lives and livelihoods under the guise of public health measures. He argues that a repeat of the stringent controls and mandates witnessed during the pandemic could have devastating and lasting impacts on the society and economy, making it imperative for the people to be informed, rational, and resolute in their response.
