Late into the night, in a quiet Georgia neighborhood, an ordinary family found themselves in a harrowing situation. A man, wanted in Ohio for murder, had broken into their home. Little did he realize, the homeowner was prepared and determined to protect his loved ones.

### The Invasion

Michael James Brooks II, known for his involvement in a series of crimes including a fatal stabbing in Ohio, broke into a residence in Georgia. However, the family man of the house was ready. Armed with a firearm and keen instincts, he confronted Brooks, who was wielding a knife, in his basement.

Upon spotting the intruder, the homeowner didn't immediately resort to force. He issued a warning to Brooks. But as events escalated, he had to fire two shots to defend himself and his family. This quick thinking and bravery potentially saved multiple lives.

### Prompt Police Response

The Fayette County Sheriff's Office (FCSO) was alerted to the situation by a security alarm triggered at the house. With deputies just three minutes away, the homeowner made a strategic move. He took a defensive position on the second-floor staircase, preparing for any possible confrontation as Brooks made his way upwards. By the time the police arrived, Brooks had sustained two gunshot wounds.

Brooks is currently in medical care. Once released, he is set to face a series of charges including burglary, home invasion, and theft in Georgia, along with murder charges in Ohio.

### Connecting The Dots

The connection between Brooks and the crime scene was made clear when a Ford truck, reported stolen from Kettering, Ohio, was found outside the burglarized home in Georgia. It was this lead that confirmed Brooks' involvement. The vehicle had plates different from the original, indicating a possible attempt to conceal his tracks.

Investigators also believe that Brooks might have approached several homes in the Georgia neighborhood before zeroing in on the residence he invaded.

### A Glimpse into Brooks' Past

The Columbus Division of Police identified Brooks as the main suspect in another home invasion that resulted in the tragic death of 77-year-old Emily Foster. This invasion took place in the city's University District on September 9. 

The exact motivations and means by which Brooks moved from Ohio to Georgia remain a matter of investigation.

### The Importance of Preparedness

This incident, though harrowing, stands as a testament to the importance of being prepared. The homeowner's swift action and dedication to safeguarding his family underscore the value of personal safety and the right to defend one's home and loved ones.
