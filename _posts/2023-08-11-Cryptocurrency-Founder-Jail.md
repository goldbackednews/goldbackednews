In a startling development, the bail of FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been revoked by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. This decision was based on probable cause, suspecting Bankman-Fried of tampering with witnesses on at least two occasions.

The 31-year-old, once a billionaire, now stands accused of misappropriating billions from FTX customer accounts to cover losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. Notably, his trial, centered on fraud allegations, is slated for October.

Despite the looming trial, Bankman-Fried's plea remains not guilty. The gravity of the situation became palpable when he was escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs by the U.S. Marshals Service after a routine security check. The poignant scene was witnessed by his parents, both Stanford University law professors. Their visible anguish underscored the dramatic turn of events.

Since his arrest in December 2022, Bankman-Fried had been largely restricted to his family's Palo Alto home under a $250 million bond. The surprise motion to incarcerate him came after allegations that he shared personal writings of Caroline Ellison, Alameda's Chief Executive and a former romantic partner, with a New York Times reporter. Ellison, along with two other former close associates of Bankman-Fried, has pleaded guilty to fraud. Ellison is anticipated to be a key witness against him in the October trial.

Judge Kaplan, known for his strict courtroom demeanor and who recently presided over defamation suits against former U.S. President Donald Trump and a sexual abuse lawsuit against Britain's Prince Andrew, expressed concerns over Bankman-Fried's attempts to "cover his tracks."

Defending his client, attorney Mark Cohen contended that the sharing of Ellison's writings was a move to defend Bankman-Fried's reputation, highlighting his right to interact with the press under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

While a gag order has already been implemented, preventing Bankman-Fried from publicly discussing his case, the New York Times has petitioned for this restriction to be limited only to comments that could jeopardize a fair trial.

Bankman-Fried's detention venue remains uncertain. While many awaiting trial in NYC are confined at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, notorious for its poor conditions, Prosecutor Danielle Sassoon has proposed the Putnam County Correctional Facility. This facility is equipped with internet-enabled laptops, allowing Bankman-Fried to review evidence ahead of his trial.
