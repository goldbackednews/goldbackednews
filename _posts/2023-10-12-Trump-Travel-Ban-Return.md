In the wake of the recent conflict in Israel, former President Donald Trump has asserted his intention to reestablish the travel ban on "terror-afflicted countries," stirring support among his base and reviving debates on the matter.

Addressing Republican voters in New Hampshire, Trump was unequivocal in his commitment to revive the travel ban that he had previously put into effect in 2017. This executive order had restricted most legal immigration from nations like Iran, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, among others, on account of their alleged links to terrorism.

“During my presidency, we took decisive actions like the TRAVEL BAN to ensure Radical Islamic Terrorists were kept away from American shores,” Trump confidently remarked. He further added, “We’ll halt funding to Palestinian terrorists immediately and reinstate the travel ban, ensuring the horrors we’ve seen recently will never touch American soil.”

The Trump-era travel ban, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a tight decision, targeted countries that either withheld vital national security information or were identified as havens and patrons of terrorism. Renowned agencies like the State Department identified multiple nations, including North Korea and Iran, as "state sponsors of terrorism."

The effects of the travel ban were palpable and significant. Breitbart News reported a marked decline of around 80% in legal immigration from the affected countries by February 2019, compared to figures from 2016.

However, in a move that contrasted Trump's stringent approach, President Joe Biden nullified the travel ban in late January 2021, enabling the resumption of legal immigration from the previously barred countries.

Trump's strict stance on immigration, particularly from terror-afflicted countries, found significant resonance among Americans, even amidst criticism from several quarters. A survey conducted in November 2018 revealed that over four in nine U.S. voters endorsed the travel ban. Furthermore, by January 2019, a significant 80% of American voters expressed support for "tough" restrictions on legal immigration, similar to the travel ban, from countries associated with terrorism.

With the 2024 elections on the horizon, Trump's renewed call to bring back the travel ban could well shape the discourse and debates on national security and immigration in the coming months.
