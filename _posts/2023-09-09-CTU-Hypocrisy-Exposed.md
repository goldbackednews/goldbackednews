In a revealing twist of irony, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) president, Stacy Davis Gates, who has staunchly opposed school choice and private education, has enrolled her own child in a Catholic high school. The CTU's rhetoric has long positioned private schools and school choice as mechanisms of segregation and racism. Yet, the choices of its leaders seem to belie their public stance.

## Union Leader Talks the Talk, but Does She Walk the Walk?

Gates, having been elected CTU president in 2022, has frequently voiced her opinions on the matter. In a past post on X (previously Twitter), she had mentioned, "*School choice* was actually the choice of racists." Furthermore, she had equated private schools to "segregation academies." Yet, recent revelations by NBC Chicago have shown that her son has been enrolled in a private Catholic high school.

The Union Leader's defense? She claims that quality education is a dream for Black families, not a reality. In a passionate statement, she outlined the struggles Black and Brown communities face, from food and healthcare deserts to a lack of quality options close to their homes. However, this reasoning seems to only strengthen the argument for school choice - giving parents the ability to choose the best environment for their child's education, irrespective of socio-economic constraints.

## Advocates Weigh In

The revelation about Gates's choice of education for her child has been met with stern criticism. Corey DeAngelis, a renowned school choice advocate, labeled Gates a "school choice hypocrite." He commented, "She tried to defend her hypocrisy by pointing to a supposed ‘disinvestment’ in public schools. But that flimsy defense is a pile of garbage, because Chicago Public Schools spend over $27,000 per student per year, whereas her son’s private school tuition is less than $15,000 per year." He highlighted the lack of accountability in public schools, leading to inefficiencies in utilizing the vast resources at their disposal.

## The MAGA Takeaway

To our MAGA crowd, the story underscores what we've been saying all along - individuals, not unions or governing bodies, should be making decisions that best serve their interests and that of their families. If Gates believes in the public school system and its efficacy, why not let her child be a testament to its success?

The Union Leader's actions expose the growing chasm between what's preached by the elites and their actual choices. It's time for proponents of school choice to drive the narrative and ensure that every child, irrespective of their background, has access to quality education.

As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. It's time for the Union Leader to either walk her talk or step aside and let families make the choices they deem best for their children.
