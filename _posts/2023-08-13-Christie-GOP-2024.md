In a candid conversation, former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) acknowledged a strategic blunder made by the GOP in the 2016 election race - not challenging then-candidate Donald Trump robustly enough. He also expressed how this past experience shapes his approach to the upcoming 2024 nomination race.

## Revisiting the 2016 Elections

On ABC’s “This Week,” Christie revisited the 2016 Republican primary race. After the host, Jonathan Karl, played a clip showing Christie confronting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), he was prompted with a question: whether, in hindsight, Christie wished he had directed his criticisms towards Donald Trump instead of Rubio.

In response, Christie expressed a broader regret, not only for himself but also for other GOP candidates of that time. "I wish that I had taken swings at both of them," Christie commented, implicating both Trump and Rubio. He lamented the collective misjudgment made by himself and other notable candidates like Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich, in not being more aggressive towards Trump.

## "It Should Inform Everybody’s Approach This Time"

The crux of Christie's regret stems from an underestimation of Trump's appeal to the public. He noted, “I think we all were under the illusion that somehow what was obvious to us at the moment, that there were better candidates on the stage than him, would be obvious to the public.”

Clearly, the assumption proved incorrect as Trump secured the nomination and eventually the presidency. Christie’s remarks can be seen as both a reflection on past misjudgments and a warning for future races. The former NJ Governor highlighted the importance of recognizing and acknowledging the public sentiment, hinting at a more informed and adaptable strategy for his 2024 presidential campaign.

## A New Era in GOP Politics

Christie's introspective comments signal a shift in the GOP's internal dynamics. As the 2024 race looms, candidates will be wise to consider the lessons from 2016, ensuring they are in tune with public sentiment and prepared to address strong contenders head-on. While Christie has clearly signposted his intent for a different approach in 2024, it remains to be seen how other GOP contenders will adapt their strategies in the race for nomination.
