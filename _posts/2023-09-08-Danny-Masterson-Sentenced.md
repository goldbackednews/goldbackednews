In a case that has caught the attention of the entertainment industry and beyond, 'That '70s Show' star, Danny Masterson, has been sentenced to a substantial 30 years in prison after a conviction on charges of rape.

Court sketches depicted an emotional scene as actor and model Bijou Phillips, Masterson's wife, looked on. Masterson was seen blowing a kiss to her just moments before being escorted away. The verdict came after an eight-day deliberation, where a jury found him guilty of two counts of forcible rape.

## Maximum Punishment Meted Out

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo handed down the 15 years-to-life imprisonment for each count to be served consecutively. This verdict ensures that Masterson will only be eligible for parole after 25 1/2 years, keeping the possibility open for a lifetime sentence.

District Attorney George Gasc√≥n lauded the verdict, citing the challenging journey faced by the victims. In his words, the case against Masterson highlights the often-uneven playing field victims face when challenging influential figures. He hopes the verdict brings solace to the victims and serves as a deterrent to others who might exploit their position of power.

## A Glimmer of Hope for Masterson?

Despite the severe sentencing, Masterson's legal team remains optimistic. They've voiced concerns about what they perceive as "substantial" errors during the trial and intend to appeal the court's decision. Shawn Holley, Masterson's attorney, stressed their respect for the justice system but emphasized that they believe an incorrect verdict was reached in this case. They are confident in their hopes to overturn the convictions.

## Scientology in the Spotlight

The trial has not only shone a spotlight on Masterson but also on the Church of Scientology. Accusations flew regarding the Church's role in the aftermath of the alleged assaults. Victims claimed reluctance in filing charges, pointing fingers at the Church's strict internal handling of such issues. The Church, however, refuted these claims, stating their clear policy on adhering to the laws of the land and dispelling rumors of harassment of the accusers.

## An Emotional Turmoil

As statements flowed in from various parties, the impact on the victims became evident. Impact statements delivered in court painted a picture of the trauma and emotional scarring these events have left behind. One of the victims stated, "When you raped me, you stole from me," describing rape as a "theft of the spirit."

Masterson, once a beloved figure on 'That '70s Show', now faces the reality of his actions. As the entertainment industry reflects on another one of its own falling from grace, the broader conversation around power dynamics, consent, and the role of institutions in such cases continues to evolve.
