The House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer (R-KY), has issued a demand to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The committee seeks access to all documents and communications wherein then-Vice President Joe Biden used several pseudonyms, notably "Robert Peters," "Robin Ware," and "JRB Ware."

This demand stems from a concern over Biden's possible communications, under these pseudonyms, that relate to official duties which may have coincided with his son, Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine.

An intriguing email, already in the committee's possession, reveals an attachment detailing the vice president's schedule. This schedule indicates a telephonic conversation between then-Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President, Petro Poroshenko. What raises eyebrows is that this email, addressed to "Robert L. Peters," also cc's Hunter Biden.

Drawing on historical context, during the Obama administration, Joe Biden was the foreign policy focal point for Ukraine. Controversy swirls around Biden's alleged threat of withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine back in 2015, pressuring the Ukrainian president to dismiss prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Shokin, at the time, was responsible for an investigation into Burisma Holdings, an energy company that compensated Hunter Biden with a monthly sum of $83,000 for a board position. The rationale, as described by Biden business associate Devon Archer, was to leverage the Biden "brand."

Fast forward to 2018, Joe Biden publically spoke about his instrumental role in the firing of Shokin during a 2015 official visit to Ukraine. In a bold declaration, he recounted telling Ukrainian officials, "I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money." Indeed, Shokin was dismissed.

NARA received a specific request from Comer on Tuesday, demanding all unredacted materials that feature then-Vice President Biden using a pseudonym, especially concerning his ties to Ukraine. A particularly emphasized email has been highlighted, titled, "Email Messages To and/or From Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden related to Burisma and Ukraine."

Comer seeks transparency, expressing concerns over the perceived merging of Biden's official duties and his family's foreign business ventures. He states, "Joe Biden has said there was 'an absolute wall' between his family’s foreign business schemes and his duties as Vice President, but evidence suggests that access was unrestrained for his family’s influence peddling."

With evidence already suggesting the intersection of then-Vice President Biden's official duties and Hunter Biden's business pursuits, Comer's insistence on revealing the full story is clear. The deadline set for NARA to provide the necessary material is August 31, 2023.
