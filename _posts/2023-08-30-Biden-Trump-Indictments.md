As political tensions rise, a recent poll unveils that a staggering 60% of voters believe that President Joe Biden might be directly interfering with the 2024 electoral scene by playing a role in the indictments against former President Donald Trump. This notion could signify a worrying trend where elections are not won based on policies or leadership but through underhanded tactics and political games.

**Growing Mistrust Towards Biden**

New York and Georgia officials, complemented by Special Counsel Jack Smith, have slapped Trump with four indictments within a span of just five months. Trump staunchly views these actions as a blatant attempt at election interference. The McLaughlin & Associates poll asked voters about the extent of Biden's involvement in these indictments against Trump. A dominant 60% felt Biden was somehow involved, while only 29% believed he wasn't. A meager 11% were unsure.

This growing mistrust is not limited to Trump supporters or the Republican voter base alone. Independent voters, often seen as the barometer of public sentiment, are echoing similar doubts. A significant 55% of independent voters sense Biden's hand in these indictments, with 31% thinking he had a significant role in the matter.

**A Dangerous Precedent?**

Such sentiments, if accurate, could lead the U.S. down a precarious path. Many legal experts and media personalities are voicing concerns that indicting a former president based on potential political motivations could pave the way for a future where political vendettas override the essence of democracy, pushing the nation towards the alarming thresholds of a banana republic.

**Trump Speaks Out**

Never one to shy away from expressing his thoughts, Trump labeled these indictments as sheer "election interference." He stated, "What they're doing is election interference. They're trying to interfere with an election. There's never been anything like it in our country before. This is their way of campaigning."

It's clear that Trump perceives these indictments as deliberate obstacles erected by Biden, especially as the 2024 election nears. His assertions are not without merit. With CIVIQs polling indicating that only a mere quarter of Americans feel the country is on the right track, Biden's tactics might be a desperate attempt to deflect attention and tarnish Trump's image.

Moreover, it's disheartening for many to see that among independent voters, just 17% believe that under Biden, the nation is on a righteous path. A whopping 75% feel it's veering off course.

**In Conclusion**

While the political arena has always been rife with contention, it's crucial that any actions, especially those involving legal consequences, are driven by genuine concerns and not political one-upmanship. As the 2024 elections approach, one hopes for a contest of policies and visions, not political vendettas.
