As the spotlight shone brightly on the Spanish Women’s World Cup victory over England, it wasn't the triumphant team that stole the headlines but rather a controversial act by Spanish Soccer Federation (RFEF) President, Luis Rubiales. His unsolicited kiss on star player Jennifer Hermoso’s mouth post-victory has elicited outrage from the global soccer community, emphasizing a need for change in the sport’s culture.

Former U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) powerhouse, Megan Rapinoe, never one to shy away from a battle for justice, was among the most vociferous of critics. She took the opportunity to reflect on the broader issues plaguing women's soccer in Spain, stating, “It made me think about how much we are required to endure.” 

Last year, the Spanish women's team became a focal point of controversy when 15 senior members sent an ultimatum letter, demanding significant changes within the coaching staff. This plea was brushed off by the federation, amplifying the apparent disconnect between the players and the administration.

Rapinoe was direct in her criticism of Rubiales' actions, calling it a clear representation of the “deep level of misogyny and sexism” evident in the Spanish side. More so, she didn't mince her words labeling the act as a form of “assault.” 

Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, too joined the chorus of voices demanding more accountability. He critiqued Rubiales’ apology as inadequate and called for introspection into the systemic sexism prevalent in Spanish sports. 

In response to the spiraling controversy, the RFEF will convene a general assembly to discuss the future of Rubiales and potentially broader reforms. 

As the world of soccer continues to evolve and fight for equal rights and representation, incidents like this serve as poignant reminders of the underlying battles that persist off the field. The hope is that the global outcry will serve as a catalyst for positive change, ensuring that future victories can be celebrated without the overshadowing specter of prejudice.
