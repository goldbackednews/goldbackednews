The United States is grappling with an unprecedented number of asylum seekers. According to recent data, under President Joe Biden's administration, more than 1.6 million border crossers are currently residing in the country with unresolved asylum claims. This number eclipses the populations of 11 U.S. states.

The majority of these claims, based on historical federal data, are poised to be denied.

### A Bursting Asylum System

Detailed data, as reviewed by Andrew Arthur from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), has shed light on the extensive catch and release network implemented by the Biden administration. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is reported to be releasing an escalating number of border crossers into the U.S. interior monthly, many with questionable asylum claims.

Arthur accentuates that the present number of applicants is a staggering load for the adjudicators. The Biden administration, he asserts, has effectively destabilized the asylum system, while appearing to downplay the profound implications.

He goes on to remark that almost every alien encountered by the Customs and Border Patrol at the southwest border has been allowed entry by Bidenâ€™s DHS. The massive backlog suggests that hundreds of thousands won't see their claims resolved for almost a decade.

### Historical Highs and Concerning Trends

Elizabeth Jacobs, the CIS Director of Regulatory Affairs and Policy, pointed out the alarming rate of increase in unresolved asylum cases. The current 1.6 million border crossers with unresolved claims mark a drastic surge from Fiscal Year 2012, when only 100,000 pending cases were recorded. This, she highlights, is the highest in American historical records.

Past reports from Breitbart News align with this trend, noting how a significant fraction of border crossers released within the U.S. had unsupported asylum claims, confirming years of analogous findings.

Drawing from data, in Fiscal Year 2022, 52 percent of asylum seekers had their claims invalidated. This increased to 60 percent in Fiscal Year 2021, and in Fiscal Year 2020, 70 percent were denied the right to stay.

The ongoing issue poses questions about border control policies, the effectiveness of the asylum system, and the potential long-term societal and economic implications for the country.
