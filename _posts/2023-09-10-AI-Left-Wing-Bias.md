The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in journalism is not devoid of controversy. At the recent Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson dropped a bombshell, warning of the growing left-wing bias embedded within AI's content generation.

In today's fast-paced media environment, the objectivity and quality of news are of paramount importance. However, Thomson raised concerns, painting a picture of an industry where AI's "rubbish in, rubbish out" approach could further entrench existing biases, especially the left-leaning slant observed in certain media giants.

AI, with its capacity to sift through and regenerate vast amounts of pre-existing content, can inadvertently proliferate and magnify any inherent biases. The CEO's vivid depiction of the potential fallout is that of an "ever-shrinking circle of sanity surrounded by a reservoir of rubbish." In essence, instead of embracing the potential insights AI could bring, the media landscape is at risk of turning into what he evocatively described as "maggot-ridden mind mold."

But beyond the bias, Thomson shed light on the broader implications of AI in journalism. He highlighted the disturbing decline in newsroom employment, indicating a drop of nearly 57% between 2008 to 2020. With AI poised to take a more substantial role, the livelihoods of thousands more are under threat.

Thomson's solution? Accountability. He asserted that companies training generative AI using archived materials should compensate the original publishers appropriately. "If you derive benefit from our content, we should derive a benefit or else youâ€™re in danger of undermining the creation of that content," he stated.

The discourse around AI's role in journalism, especially its political bias, is a pressing concern. As the lines between human-led journalism and AI-generated content blur, Thomson's cautionary note is a clarion call for the industry to tread carefully, ensuring technology enhances rather than skews the narrative.
