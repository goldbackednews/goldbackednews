When iconic moments and Hollywood's brightest stars collide at events like the MTV Video Music Awards, the internet doesn't stay silent. This year, all eyes (and lenses) were on Justin Timberlake and Megan Thee Stallion.

A backstage video, making its rounds on social media, captured Timberlake and Stallion deep in conversation, with Megan's hand gestures making it a particularly animated chat. This led the rumor mill to spin tales of a possible feud between the two artists.

But were these speculations accurate?

Insiders quickly debunked the feud theory. A close source clarified to news outlets, "Meg loves Justin. She was excitedly saying they'd never met before." A simple conversation turned misconstrued, it seems.

In the age of social media clarity, both artists hopped onto TikTok, where Stallion shared a video of their interaction. Her caption? A light-hearted "I just talk with my hands lol. See ya next time @JustinTimberlake."

The VMAs were not just about this fleeting moment, though. Megan Thee Stallion had two nominations, but the awards evaded her this time around. 

But perhaps the most nostalgic and electrifying segment of the night was Timberlake's reunion with NSYNC, as they presented the best pop video award. Memories of their first VMA win for 'Bye Bye Bye' flooded back, as JC Chasez reminisced, "Over 20 years ago, we were just kids when we won."

The evening culminated with Taylor Swift snagging the coveted Moonman statuette for her track "Anti-Hero."

In the glam and glitter of the VMAs, one thing's for sure: whether it's addressing rumors or celebrating old memories, music always finds a way to bring people together.
