As the remnants of what was Tropical Storm Hilary batter the American Southwest, residents brace for even more torrential downpours and resulting havoc.

After having been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, Hilary continues its tempestuous course, primarily affecting Southern California and Nevada. The National Weather Service, in an urgent advisory, warned of an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain, with some areas potentially witnessing a whopping total of 12 inches.

Tragic scenes unfolded as water rescues were carried out, particularly in vulnerable areas. A heart-wrenching incident involved at least 13 individuals, who had to be rescued from knee-high water levels at a homeless encampment along the San Diego River. Water rescue operations were also reported in Palm Springs and Cathedral City's Canyon Mobile Home Park.

With Hilary moving on to Idaho later in the day, an expected 1 to 3 inches of rain is anticipated, with isolated pockets receiving as much as 5 inches. 

Gov. Gavin Newsom, acutely aware of the situation, interacted with impacted communities on Sunday evening, right when Hilary made its presence felt. In an eerie coincidence, the storm's arrival was preceded by a 5.1 magnitude earthquake.

In a move to ensure utmost safety and support for the communities, Newsom expanded the state of emergency to encompass more counties. His additional orders aim to provide care facilities with greater adaptability to tend to patients during this tumultuous period. Keeping the lines of communication open, Newsom has been in constant touch with local leaders, emergency response teams, and even President Biden to address Hilary's ongoing impact.

The State Operations Center, under the governor's directive, remains operational around the clock. Officials are not only monitoring the immediate impacts of the storm but are also preparing for potential aftershocks from the earlier earthquake.

To combat Hilary's devastation, California has pooled its resources, activating the Medical and Health Coordination Center, distributing over 300,000 sandbags for flood containment, pre-positioning the California National Guard, and deploying fire and rescue teams across impacted zones.

In a spirit of unity, the state is collaborating with giants like Target, Wal-Mart, CVS Health, and other essential suppliers to ensure necessary supplies are readily available. Fuel suppliers, utility providers, and telecommunication companies are also on board, ensuring the continuity of vital services.

Furthermore, in a commendable gesture, a partnership between Newsom's office and Uber is offering discounted transport to shelters, making it a bit easier for residents to find refuge.

While Hilary's full impact is yet to be determined, the combined forces of community support, emergency services, and government interventions are testament to the resilience and unity of the affected regions.
