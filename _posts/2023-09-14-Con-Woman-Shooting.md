In a chilling account of trust betrayed, Yasmine Hider, 21, has admitted guilt to the tragic murder of a Florida college student who, along with his girlfriend, had altruistically stopped to aid her under the pretense of car trouble.

The tragic event unfurled at Alabama's Cheaha State Park, when Adam Simjee, 22, and his girlfriend, Mikayla Paulus, heeded Hider's fabricated plea for help with her supposedly broken down XB Scion. The innocent students were unaware that Hider's car issue was an elaborate ploy; the Scion had malfunctioned weeks prior. The unsuspecting couple were drawn into a sinister plot of robbery.

As detailed in the plea agreement, a chilling confrontation ensued when Hider suddenly brandished a firearm at Simjee and Paulus, demanding their belongings. In an effort to defend both himself and Paulus, Simjee revealed his own gun. A fierce gunfight erupted between Hider and Simjee, culminating in injuries to both parties. 

Drenched in shock and despair, Hider, with bullets in her abdomen and leg, expressed her regret, muttering, "It wasn't supposed to be like this." As the reality of the calamity became clear, an alleged associate of Hider's, Krystal Pinkins, briefly made an appearance from the thicket, only to quickly vanish.

Paulus, in the face of abject horror, frantically dialed 911, attempting to resuscitate her critically wounded boyfriend. Despite her best efforts, Simjee tragically succumbed to his injuries.

In a poignant online tribute to her fallen partner, Paulus lamented, "The rest of my life will be a love letter to him. I'll miss you and love you forever sweet boy."

Law enforcement's investigations illuminated a darker, more convoluted narrative. Both suspects, Pinkins and Hider, had been leading an "off-the-grid" lifestyle in the Talladega National Forest, adjacent to the crime scene. Startlingly, they were found to have affiliations with notorious cult leader Rashad Jamal White.

The drama further intensified when, during Pinkins' arrest, her five-year-old son emerged brandishing a loaded firearm. The child eventually surrendered the weapon, facilitating Pinkins' arrest. 

According to FBI interrogations, Pinkins disclosed that they had entrusted Hider with the gun. Furthermore, they had attempted a similar deceit on an older woman just a day prior, which, fortunately, did not proceed as the lady declined their beckoning.

The chilling case serves as a somber reminder of the unpredictability of life and the lurking shadows behind innocent facades. Pinkins awaits her day in court, as the community mourns the loss of a young life taken too soon.
