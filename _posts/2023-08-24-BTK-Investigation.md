In a recent revelation exclusive to Fox News, law enforcement officials have discovered "items of interest" during a two-day search operation at the erstwhile Park City, Kansas, residence of the infamous BTK serial killer, Dennis Rader.

### Digging Deeper into Cold Cases

While investigating unsolved murders and chilling disappearances, authorities were drawn to Rader's former property. Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden expressed to Fox News Digital: "Through the investigation, we developed information of some possible trophies of Dennis Rader's. Following up on those leads with Park City, we did recover some items of interest."

The current probe specifically throws light on the mysterious 1976 disappearance of Cynthia "Cyndi" Dawn Kinney in Osage County, Oklahoma. Given the proximity to Rader's activities during that period, investigators are delving into potential connections between him and other unresolved cases.

### Kinney's Disappearance and Rader's Denial

Kinney's last known whereabouts trace back to her aunt and uncle's laundromat in Pawhuska, a mere two-hour commute from Rader's residence at the time. While Rader confessed and was convicted for 10 murders following his 2005 apprehension, he vehemently denies any association with other crimes.

Referring to the recent findings, Sheriff Virden commented, "We werenâ€™t looking for bodies, we were looking for items. We did find some items. We can't release what they are." It remains ambiguous whether this evidence ties back to Rader's confessed crimes or unveils new skeletons in his closet.

### Trophies Buried in the Past?

Rader's proclivity for "trophies" from his victims came into sharp focus as his daughter, Kerri Rawson, hinted at the possibility of concealed evidence on the property. "The theory is he could have placed evidence of cases under stone pavers under the metal shed he built early to mid '90s, like drivers licenses in jars," she mused.

As anticipation builds, authorities are gearing up to share more insights later today.

### Treading with Empathy

While the investigation progresses, authorities are mindful of the trauma revisited by the victims' families. Sheriff Virden empathetically remarked, "Our concern is more for the families. I hate tearing open old wounds, but we've still got to follow the leads we've got, where they go, and we'll try and be as respectful as we can to everybody involved and still do our job."

As the world watches, the hope remains that these findings provide closure to families and unravel the remaining mysteries surrounding the BTK killer's dark legacy.
