In a triumphant move for American freedoms and rights, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman declared on Saturday that he would not enforce New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s (D) 30-day ban on concealed carry. 

This shocking, yet commendable act of defiance came swiftly in response to the ban which had only taken effect on Saturday, September 8, 2023. The hastily-imposed prohibition not only prevents the concealed carrying of handguns but also bars open carry, effectively disarming lawful citizens in places such as Albuquerque, located in Bernalillo County.

Governor Grisham’s rash directive targets even licensed concealed carriers. In an era where citizens are encouraged to be more self-reliant for their safety and well-being, such decrees seem wildly out of touch with the core values upon which the nation was founded.

D.A. Bregman, standing as a beacon for constitutional rights and the Second Amendment, stated, “As an officer of the court, I cannot and will not enforce something that is clearly unconstitutional.” He further emphasized that his office would remain dedicated to pursuing actual criminals who misuse firearms for illegal endeavors, rather than infringing upon law-abiding citizens' rights.

Echoing this sentiment of upholding foundational American rights, New Mexico state rep. John Block (R) fired back at Grisham’s order, rallying for her impeachment and receiving vocal support: “Impeach and remove Lujan Grisham. We even have Elon behind us on this!”

Adding weight to the collective rejection of this ill-conceived ban, Albuquerque police chief Harold Medina unequivocally stated that he would not be enforcing the governor’s order. 

The overarching message? The people of Albuquerque, their representatives, and their law enforcement, stand united against what they see as tyranny and infringement on their constitutional rights.

Furthermore, the National Association of Gun Rights is taking the fight directly to the courts, having already filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in New Mexico against the ban. The battle for Second Amendment rights is alive and well, with Albuquerque at its forefront, championing the cause.
