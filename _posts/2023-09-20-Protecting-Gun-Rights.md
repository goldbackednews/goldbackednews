In response to what some are calling aggressive moves by the left, Texas Representative Michael Cloud is stepping up to safeguard the rights of gun owners. On Tuesday, he reintroduced the "Protecting the Right To Keep and Bear Arms Act". This legislation, if passed, would restrict the president and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using public health emergencies as a means to enforce gun control measures.

## Second Amendment Under Fire?

Vice President Kamala Harris recently expressed her support for the Second Amendment on "The Jennifer Hudson Show". However, her endorsement for an assault weapons ban in the same conversation has raised eyebrows among conservatives.

Meanwhile, Michael Cloud has expressed concern over the strategies of the 'radical left'. "For a long time, radical left politicians have been open about their willingness to use executive authority and rob Americans of their Second Amendment rights," Cloud stated, pointing out the need for his reintroduced bill.

The catalyst for such statements and actions is clear. Last week, New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, declared gun violence as a public health crisis and attempted to implement a 30-day prohibition on carrying firearms in public spaces and on state-owned properties in Albuquerque. Cloud did not hold back in his criticism, "The Biden administration, Gov. Grisham, and others have exercised extraordinary executive power to push their liberal agenda and expand the power of the government."

## The Response

Grisham's bold move faced swift resistance. A judge promptly blocked the proposed 30-day gun ban. In turn, Grisham adjusted her rule to limit firearms at public parks or playgrounds, specifically mentioning areas "where we know we have high risk of kids and families."

Many, including Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, have voiced their concerns. Johnston noted that Grisham's utilization of a 'public health emergency' to suspend the Second Amendment is a troubling instance of officials potentially misusing 'emergency powers' to infringe on constitutional rights.

In light of these concerns, Rep. Pete Sessions and Rep. Mary Miller have also shown their support for Cloud's bill, emphasizing the importance of preserving the rights of gun owners.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't the first time gun violence has been referred to as a "public health crisis." Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra used the term after a mass shooting in Atlanta. Prior to that, officials in California had made similar appeals to label gun violence as a public health emergency.

In a polarized political climate, the debate over gun rights and gun control continues to intensify. With representatives like Michael Cloud taking a stand, the future of the Second Amendment remains a fiercely contested topic in the United States.
