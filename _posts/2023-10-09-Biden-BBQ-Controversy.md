In a surprising turn of events, President Joe Biden and his administration have come under heavy criticism for reportedly hosting a barbecue at the White House. This criticism is deeply intertwined with the grave news of Americans being killed or taken hostage during Hamas’ unexpected attack on Israel.

On Sunday, the White House National Security Council made an official announcement confirming the unfortunate loss of multiple American lives during this assault. The timing of this announcement is particularly poignant, as a memo about a scheduled White House barbecue surfaced the very next day.

According to the memo, "The President and First Lady are hosting a barbecue for White House Executive Residence staff and their families." 

The confluence of these two events — the barbecue and the news of the Hamas attack — ignited a storm of outrage. Critics and commentators from various political backgrounds voiced their concerns, with many pointing out the seemingly inconsiderate juxtaposition.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for instance, took to his platform to express his dismay, stating, “While Hamas holds Americans hostage, Joe Biden is enjoying a picnic with a live band.” Similarly, reporter Jennie Taer commented on the disconcerting situation, citing that a war was unfolding in the Middle East involving US citizens, all while the president and the First Lady were hosting a BBQ.

Political commentators and former White House officials also voiced their opinions. Katie Pavlich, a conservative commentator, and Brilyn Hollyhand, a political commentator, both highlighted the tragedy of American citizens being impacted by the conflict and juxtaposed it with the president's decision to host a BBQ. Karoline Leavitt, a MAGA Inc. spokeswoman, contrasted Biden's actions with those of former President Trump, suggesting the latter would've been more responsive.

Several other individuals, from journalists to commentators, also expressed their deep concerns and frustrations, with some using the tagline, "BBQ First, America Last" to summarize their sentiments.

In the backdrop of this controversy, it's important to note that the Hamas attack over the weekend resulted in the tragic loss of American lives. Confirmations from the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Mike Herzog, and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, further highlighted that American citizens were among the hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas.

As the situation continues to evolve, the decisions and actions of the Biden administration remain under intense scrutiny by both the American public and global onlookers.
