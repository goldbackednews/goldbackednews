A blow was dealt to Alec Baldwin's legal defense today as a judge rejected the motion to dismiss the civil lawsuit filed against him and the "Rust" production companies by three crew members. 

The action was compounded when Judge Bryan Biedscheid also declined a request to stay civil proceedings pending the outcome of associated criminal matters. Notably, Baldwin's defense team had raised concerns that the actor may still face new charges related to the tragic shooting incident on the set of "Rust."

Despite Judge Biedscheid acknowledging worries surrounding Baldwin's Fifth Amendment rights, he held firm, hinting at possible future protective orders or the potential assertion of the actor's rights down the line.

Baldwin's attorney, Robert Schwartz, expressed his discontent, labeling the ruling as both a "real injustice" and "unnecessary." Schwartz pointed to the plaintiffs' 16-month wait after the incident to file, while now pushing for a swift progress into the civil case discovery phase, even as the actor faces the looming cloud of criminal charges.

Ross Addiego, Doran Curtin, and Reese Price, the three crew members who initiated the lawsuit, are seeking compensatory and punitive damages for injuries they assert were sustained on the set. These injuries ranged from hearing loss and temporary deafness to vibrational shock. They allege that Baldwin and the production team acted negligently and recklessly, which culminated in the unfortunate death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in October 2021.

The plaintiffs' allegations against the production are grave, underscoring a rushed shooting schedule, frequent safety complaints, and inadequate safety protocols â€“ especially concerning the handling of firearms.

Further adding to Baldwin's woes are other pending civil lawsuits, including one filed by the family of the deceased cinematographer. Previously, Baldwin had faced involuntary manslaughter charges for the fatal shooting of Hutchins. Although these were dropped in April, special prosecutor Kari Morrissey indicated that new charges against the actor are under consideration, following the emergence of fresh evidence in the case.

As the net tightens, the entertainment community and the public at large await the next steps in what has become one of Hollywood's most talked-about legal battles.
