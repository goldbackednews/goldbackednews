With the rise of technology, industries across the globe are adapting and evolving. However, in Hollywood, a sector built on human emotion and connectivity, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is causing concern, particularly among background actors.

## A Flashpoint in Union Negotiations

As negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) continue to be gridlocked, one central issue has emerged: the use of AI to replace background actors with digital replicas. Notably, some actors have been scanned by productions but remain unaware of how or if their digital likeness will be used, leading to anxieties about the trajectory of their careers.

A seasoned background actor from Atlanta revealed to Fox News Digital that he had been scanned for three major projects. This involved a process with hundreds of cameras capturing his image from every conceivable angle. Despite assurances that the scan was exclusively for the project at hand, the actor expressed concerns that his digital twin could be utilized in other productions without his consent or compensation.

## Actors' Perspectives on AI Integration

Sandra Miska, a background actor with a decade's experience, echoed similar sentiments. Having been scanned for "The Call of the Wild," she confessed uncertainty about whether she'd consent to such a process again, especially considering the broader implications on the industry. 

Hollywood's longstanding use of Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) isn't new. Productions such as "Avengers: Endgame" and "The Lord of the Rings" series have extensively employed CGI to create massive armies and large crowd scenes. The technology at the heart of the current debate, however, involves scanning real people and replicating them—raising profound questions about consent, compensation, and the future of acting itself.

Chris Mack, a non-union actor from Los Angeles, captures this sentiment perfectly: "I would refuse because I want to actually have a career as an actor."

## An Industry at a Crossroads

Jeff Olan, owner of Jeff Olan Casting, shared his concerns about the lack of informed consent for background actors regarding AI and its implications. He foresees a significant shift in the industry, where the majority of background actors, especially those not in close proximity to main actors, will likely be replaced by their AI counterparts. 

The ongoing debate isn't just about technology but ethics and fair compensation. Olan asserts that if actors are scanned, they deserve to be duly compensated, especially if their digital likeness is used in multiple projects.

SAG-AFTRA's stand on the issue is clear: the union believes that actors should have control over their images and be adequately compensated for their use. This sentiment was underscored by SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, who emphasized the union's commitment to a fair contract.

However, the AMPTP refutes some of the union's claims, arguing that their current proposal only permits the use of a digital replica of a background actor for the specific movie they were employed for. Any other use would necessitate the actor's consent.

## A Balanced Approach to AI?

While AI's potential impact on the film industry is undeniable, some experts believe the concerns may be slightly exaggerated. Marva Bailer, an AI advisor, suggests that while AI will play a role, it won't replace the creativity and emotions that only humans can bring to the cinematic canvas.

Daniel R. Gutenplan, a partner with EPG Lawyers, concurs, stating that while 'digital doubles' might be on the horizon, fully replacing actors with AI-generated likenesses remains a distant reality.

As the world of cinema stands at the intersection of technology and human creativity, the future trajectory remains to be seen. One thing is certain, though: the role of AI in Hollywood is a debate that's here to stay.
