The state of Maine and the nation exhaled a collective sigh of relief as law enforcement officials announced the discovery of Robert Card’s body, bringing an end to the intense manhunt following the horrific mass shooting in Lewiston. The Maine State Police tactical team made the discovery in an overflow parking location, concluding days of tireless work by hundreds of officers.

Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck shared insights into the manhunt and the recovery of the suspect's body during a press conference. "This is a tractor trailer style — you know, you picture that 18-wheeler. This is what the trailer would look like. A box trailer is where he was located. Right in the back of that," Sauschuck explained.

Robert Card, the primary suspect in Wednesday’s mass shooting at Schemengees Bar and Grille and the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley, left 18 dead and 13 injured in his wake. The shocking violence sent waves of fear and grief through the community, putting law enforcement on high alert as they searched for the armed and dangerous suspect.

Officials highlighted the crucial role of Card's family during the manhunt, praising their cooperation. “I was asked about cooperation of the family at one point, and this family has been incredibly cooperative with us,” Sauschuck stated. “Truth be told, I think the first three people that called us to positively identify this individual based on the photos that were released were family members.”

In response to the tragedy, state officials are establishing a “family assistance center” to support the victims’ families. This center aims to be a centralized location providing comprehensive assistance, reducing the need for families to visit multiple agencies during their time of grief.

The conclusion of the manhunt marks the beginning of a new chapter for Lewiston and the affected families. As the community starts to process the events and seek closure, the support and resources provided will be crucial in helping them heal and move forward.

The events in Lewiston have also reignited national conversations about gun violence and public safety, with leaders and citizens alike reflecting on the necessary steps to prevent such tragedies in the future.
