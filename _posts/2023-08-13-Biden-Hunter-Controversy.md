President Biden, despite mounting legal challenges surrounding his son, Hunter, has consistently defended him. With Attorney General Merrick Garland recently appointing U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel to intensify the Hunter Biden probe, the narrative around the investigation has intensified.

While Weiss has been the federal prosecutor who investigated Hunter's business engagements and proposed charges in Delaware, his new title as special counsel suggests the investigation is far from completion. Notably, a previous plea agreement brokered by Weiss, viewed by many Republicans as overly lenient, was rejected by U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika.

The GOP has labeled this agreement as a "sweetheart" deal and has been keen to delve deeper into the Biden family's business dealings, hinting at possible impeachment strategies. President Biden, who began his term in January 2021, has always expressed confidence in his son's innocence. Responding to queries regarding Hunter's prior activities in Ukraine, the President iterated, "My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong."

When the subject of his son's legal challenges was raised in various interviews, Biden responded with unwavering support for Hunter. In an interview on "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert in 2020, Biden commented, "I am not concerned about any accusations against him. It's used to get to me. I think it's kind of foul play, but look, it is what it is."

The wording used in the Department of Justice's press release regarding Weiss's appointment as special counsel suggests the investigation's scope may encompass other Biden family members, potentially even the President. On being questioned if President Biden is a part of this probe, an official from the Department of Justice opted not to comment.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Chairman of the House Judiciary, voiced his concerns about Weiss's new role. Through a statement by his spokesperson, Russell Dye, Jordan said, "David Weiss can’t be trusted, and this is just a new way to whitewash the Biden family’s corruption."

As the investigation continues and political tensions rise, the nation watches closely, anticipating the unfolding of further events in this ongoing saga.
