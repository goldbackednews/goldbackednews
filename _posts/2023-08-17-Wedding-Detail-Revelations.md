A look into the glamorous yesteryears, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s star-studded Malibu wedding in 2000 remains etched in the annals of Hollywood's iconic moments. As time unfolds, certain details of the grand affair emerge, reflecting the luxury and opulence that marked their union.

**Caviar Dreams and Showbiz Reality**

Michael Rapaport, an actor known for his collaboration with both Pitt and Aniston, recently unveiled a lavish detail from the wedding on "Watch What Happens Live" with Andy Cohen. "They had a wall of caviar," Rapaport reminisced, jesting about how he still has some preserved from the wedding.

This decadent detail is just a snippet of the grandeur that the event embodied. As Rapaport further disclosed, "Billy Preston performed," hinting at the high costs that would have been associated with hiring such notable performers.

**From Nuptial Bliss to Amicable Ties**

Despite their split in 2005, the two A-listers have often been spotted sharing warm moments, renewing their bond of friendship over the years. Their reunion backstage during the 2020 Screen Actors Guild Awards set the internet abuzz, with multiple photos capturing their friendly interactions. The warmth was further highlighted when they participated in a virtual table read of the 1982 teen drama, "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" in September 2020. Clips from the reading showed the duo enjoying light moments, sparking further speculation about their rapport.

As time moves forward, these past events become cherished memories. While Pitt and Aniston have moved on with their personal lives – Aniston married Justin Theroux in 2015 and separated in 2018, while Pitt married Angelina Jolie in 2014, with their union ending in 2016 – the aura of their 2000 wedding remains fresh, a testament to the allure of old Hollywood romances.

Looking back, it's these moments of extravagance, love, and camaraderie that remind us of the glitz and glamour that comes with Hollywood fame. The legacy of Pitt and Aniston's relationship, from their marriage to their amicable interactions post-divorce, continues to captivate fans and media alike, solidifying their place as one of Hollywood's most iconic couples.
