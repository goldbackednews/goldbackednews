Saint-Tropez, often revered for its luxurious ambiance and upscale clientele, is now at the center of a brewing scandal. Some of the town's premier restaurants have reportedly employed "wealth screening" to segregate customers into "big spenders" and "small fry."

### The Tip of the Iceberg

Mayor Sylvie Siri, in a press briefing, confirmed these shocking practices, emphasizing her and the town council's staunch disapproval. "Such despicable practices ruin the town’s image," she lamented.

An inside source exposed the procedure to local news agency Var-Matin. Restaurants would delve into customers' past visits, evaluating prior bills and menu choices. This insidious categorization determined the establishment's treatment of the patron. Those classified as "small fry" would be falsely informed that reservations were booked solid for months, often being redirected to different eateries.

### "Minimum Spending" and Other Controversies

The insider further revealed that even luxury concierge services frequently emphasize "minimum spending." Patrons are coerced into making reservations at exorbitant rates, sometimes as steep as 5,000 euros ($5,400). This flagrant practice means reservations are sold to the highest bidder, leaving those unwilling or unable to pay such exorbitant fees out in the cold.

Siri vehemently denounced these actions, drawing parallels with racketeering. More alarmingly, she indicated potential infringements on personal data protection laws, questioning the legality of retaining such detailed customer spending data without explicit consent.

### Tipping Turmoil

Forced tipping is another controversy Siri highlighted. While the customary tipping rate in France is around 5-10% of the total bill, some establishments in Saint-Tropez have audaciously demanded tips upwards of 20%. One particularly egregious account involved a waiter pursuing a customer to their car, demanding extra gratuity over the already substantial 500 euros ($540) they had given.

### The Road Ahead

Although the exact establishments involved remain unnamed, repercussions are imminent. Siri is slated to meet with the restaurant owners and stakeholders in September. She is expected to reiterate their communal responsibilities. Meanwhile, she is exploring immediate measures, like potentially revoking late-night operation licenses.

For residents and visitors to Saint-Tropez alike, these revelations might prompt a reconsideration of where they choose to dine and spend their hard-earned money. Only time will reveal the long-term ramifications for the town's once unblemished reputation.
