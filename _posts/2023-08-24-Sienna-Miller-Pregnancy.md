Acclaimed actress Sienna Miller is gearing up for another chapter in her journey of motherhood. Currently vacationing in Ibiza, Miller was spotted joyfully displaying her baby bump.

### A Second Bundle of Joy

Miller, 41, known for her role in "American Woman", is presently in a relationship with Oli Green, 26, and is expecting their first child together. She already has an 11-year-old daughter, Marlowe, with her ex, actor Tom Sturridge.

### The Pressure to Conceive

In an intimate chat with Elle magazine in 2022, Miller discussed the societal pressure she felt to expand her family throughout her late 20s and 30s. Describing the urge and anxiety she felt about having another child as a "really loud noise," she shared her decision to freeze her eggs when she turned 40. This significant step provided her with a sense of relief and changed her perspective from a fervent desire to a more relaxed, "if it happens, it happens" attitude.

### A New Outlook on Relationships

Oli and Sienna's relationship began in February 2022. Speaking with British Vogue, Miller revealed how her relationship with Green rejuvenated her perspective on love and commitment. Reflecting on her past relationships, she mentioned, "I'd invested what felt like the important years in something that was just a bucket with a hole in it of a person." While she had initially envisioned a different family life, Miller takes immense pride in her role as a mother. "It's what I do best," she asserts.

### Past Relationships and Art Imitating Life

Sienna's personal life has been riddled with its fair share of ups and downs. Notably, her broken engagement with actor Jude Law in 2004 made headlines after his affair with their children's nanny. Her 2022 role in Netflix's "Anatomy of Scandal" bore an uncanny resemblance to this chapter of her life, where she portrayed a woman married to a politician embroiled in an affair.

### Motherhood Reflections

In a 2019 interview with People magazine, Miller gave a candid view of motherhood, discussing the challenges and rewards that come with it. Speaking of her daughter Marlowe, she revealed how the young girl "challenges" her, acting as a true reflection of herself. "She knows me, I know her," Miller expressed, emphasizing the profound bond they share.

As Sienna Miller embarks on this new phase of motherhood, fans and well-wishers from around the world extend their congratulations and best wishes.
