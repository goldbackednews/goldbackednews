In yet another glaring example of Washington D.C.’s spiraling crime problem, a 12-year-old has been charged following a botched carjacking that left a 13-year-old dead. This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the surging violence plaguing our nation's capital, highlighting the dire need for immediate action to protect law-abiding citizens and hold criminals accountable.

The attempted carjacking occurred around 10 p.m. Saturday in the 600 block of D Street, NW. A 12-year-old, together with 13-year-old Vernard Toney, Jr., menacingly approached an off-duty federal security officer, demanding he exit his vehicle while intimating possession of a firearm.

Faced with what appeared to be a life-threatening situation, the officer, acting in self-defense, discharged his weapon, fatally wounding Toney. The 12-year-old accomplice fled the scene, leaving behind a scenario that is becoming all too common in D.C.

Police were able to track down and arrest the 12-year-old thanks to surveillance footage, and he now awaits his day in court. But this incident is just the tip of the iceberg in a city that has seen a disturbing increase in violent crime, particularly among minors.

Critics are pointing fingers at the city’s lenient crime policies, which have created an environment where lawlessness prevails and criminals operate with impunity. The soft-on-crime approach, championed by liberal politicians and activists, has utterly failed the citizens of Washington D.C., leaving them to bear the brunt of escalating violence.

The tragic death of a young boy and the criminal involvement of another are clear indicators that the current system is not working. It is a call to action for leaders at all levels of government to step up, reject failed policies, and implement stringent measures to curb crime and ensure public safety.

Washington D.C. residents deserve to live in a city free from the fear of violence. They deserve leaders who prioritize their safety, support law enforcement, and are committed to restoring law and order. The time for talk is over; it’s time for action. We cannot afford to lose another life to the senseless violence that has taken hold of our capital.

Our nation's capital is in crisis, and it’s up to us to demand change, hold our leaders accountable, and work together to reclaim our city from the clutches of crime.
