Vice President Kamala Harris has once again captured headlines, this time not for her diminishing approval ratings, but her comments about potentially assuming the presidency if President Biden were to be incapacitated.

Harris’ claim of readiness comes as a shock to many, especially when juxtaposed against her waning popularity; a staggering 49% of registered voters hold a negative view of her, with 39% of them harboring a "very negative view."

During an interview in Jakarta, Indonesia, Harris addressed President Biden's age and health, stating she was prepared to fulfill her constitutional duty should he become unable to govern. While Harris deemed such a scenario as "hypothetical," she emphasized that every Vice President must acknowledge the responsibility of possibly taking over the presidential role.

Many critics argue that Harris' comments underscore a lack of confidence in President Biden’s fitness to serve, given his advanced age. President Biden, at 80 years old, is the oldest serving president in U.S. history. A recent AP/NORC poll revealed that a significant 77% of Americans, including 69% of Democrats, deem him too old for a second term. Such findings make Harris' remarks all the more contentious.

Harris' history as a presidential candidate, which saw her campaign fizzle out post-Democratic primary debates in 2020, is also cited by critics as a testament to her lack of widespread appeal and leadership potential. She earned fewer pledged delegates than Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or even Tulsi Gabbard.

Despite the evident public reservations about her competence, Harris continues to assert her authority on multiple fronts, even holding former President Trump accountable for the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This is seen by some as an attempt to bolster her standing as a firm leader and capable presidential successor.

With the 2024 election season heating up and potential competitors like Trump gaining momentum, Harris’ remarks about her readiness to take the presidential reins have not only reignited debates about Biden's capability but have also led many to question whether Harris herself possesses the leadership qualities the country needs in these turbulent times.
