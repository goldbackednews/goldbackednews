Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has taken a firm stance against antisemitism, deciding to withdraw from two esteemed fellowship programs at Harvard University. Hogan, a Republican and a notable figure in American politics, had accepted fellowships at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health months earlier.

Hogan's decision is a direct response to what he describes as "anti-Semitic vitriol" permeating the campus, following the deadly attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7. In a candid letter to Harvard, which Hogan shared on his social media platforms, he expressed his initial excitement about joining the Harvard community and his eagerness to impart leadership lessons to the next generation of leaders.

However, Hogan's enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment as he witnessed the university's reaction—or lack thereof—to the surge of antisemitic sentiments on campus. Over 30 Harvard student organizations openly blamed Israel for the Hamas-initiated attack, prompting Hogan to reassess his association with the prestigious institution.

"I cannot condone the dangerous anti-Semitism that has taken root on your campus," Hogan stated in his letter, highlighting the severity of the attack as the "greatest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust." He called for universal condemnation of the attack, emphasizing its fundamentally evil nature.

The student statement, released on the day of the attack, held the Israeli regime entirely responsible for the violence, outlining the longstanding tensions and challenges faced by Palestinians in Gaza. The statement quickly ignited national backlash, with business leaders pledging not to employ the students involved and some even rescinding job offers.

Harvard's administration, led by President Claudine Gay, was quick to denounce Hamas' violence and clarify that student groups do not speak on behalf of the university. However, Hogan argued that this response was not sufficient, stating that while students have the right to free speech, they should not be allowed to propagate hate speech without challenge.

Hogan's withdrawal from the Harvard fellowship programs sends a powerful message about the importance of standing against antisemitism and holding educational institutions accountable for their response to hate speech. As Hogan concludes his letter, he expresses his hope that his decision will prompt Harvard to take meaningful action against antisemitism and uphold the values it should represent to the world.
