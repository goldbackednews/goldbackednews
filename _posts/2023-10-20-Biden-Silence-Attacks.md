In a shocking display of seeming negligence, President Joe Biden has failed to publicly address a series of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Within the past 48 hours, our troops have faced at least seven targeted aggressions, and the nation's Commander in Chief has been eerily silent.

Reports confirm that U.S. officials have been aware of the continued attacks in the region, particularly with the ongoing tensions sparked by the Israel-Hamas conflict. A drone strike resulted in minor injuries for U.S. forces stationed in Syria. Another alarming incident involved a false alarm at the Al-Asad airbase in Iraq, during which a civilian contractor tragically succumbed to a cardiac arrest.

Despite dispatching naval reinforcements to the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, warships, and approximately 2,000 Marines, Biden has yet to comment on the situation or offer a strategic response. The pressing question is: Why the conspicuous silence?

The Ain al-Asad airbase, hosting U.S. and other international forces, has been at the epicenter of these attacks. The base experienced a barrage of drones and rockets, with multiple explosions reported within its confines. Another U.S. military base near Baghdad's international airport has also been targeted.

Pentagon spokesperson, Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, refrained from speculating about potential reactions to these onslaughts. However, he assured that the U.S. would take all necessary steps to protect its forces and coalition allies. Ryder emphasized that any potential response would occur "at a time in a manner of our choosing."

As tensions flare in the region, it's essential to underscore the considerable civilian casualties. Since Hamas's assault on southern Israel, approximately 1,400 individuals, primarily civilians, have lost their lives. The Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip has faced nonstop bombardments, resulting in significant Palestinian casualties.

While Ryder has stated that there isn't a direct connection between the increase in attacks on U.S. troops and the Israel-Hamas conflict, the correlation is hard to ignore. Tensions in Iraq regarding the war in Gaza have notably surged, with influential figures condemning Israel's actions and calling for global intervention.

Iranian-backed militias, known for targeting U.S. forces in Iraq and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad in the past, might be behind these recent drone strikes. Such militias had previously adhered to a truce, allowing Iraq to experience a period of relative calm. But the current circumstances and heightened sentiments could easily disrupt this fragile peace.

With U.S. forces enduring consistent attacks and mounting regional tensions, President Biden's silence is concerning. The nation looks to its leader for reassurance, strategy, and action during times of crisis. But as our brave soldiers stand their ground overseas, they await a word from their Commander in Chief.
