As the GOP candidates gear up for the second debate, Former President Donald Trump is once again pivoting away from the spotlight of party politics. Instead, he's heading to Detroit, showing his support for the striking members of the United Auto Workers (UAW).

**Trump’s Unwavering Support for the Working Class**

Multiple sources, including Breitbart News and The New York Times, have confirmed Trump's forthcoming appearance with UAW members, as they strike against automotive giants — General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. This bold move is seen as a counter to the GOP debate scheduled at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.

The main focus of the union's strike centers around higher wages amidst rising inflation and ensuring job security in President Joe Biden's shifting vehicle agenda. Trump is slated to deliver a prime-time speech to current and former union members, highlighting these concerns.

**A Strategic Move With A Broader Goal?**

This isn't the first time Trump has opted for such a strategy. Instead of attending the first GOP debate, he chose a one-on-one with Tucker Carlson, the host of the "Tucker on Twitter" show. This move generated significant attention, underscoring Trump's distinctive style.

Many believe Trump's approach is centered less on the GOP primaries and more on a potential general election rematch against President Biden. Historically, union workers, traditionally aligned with Democrats, played a crucial role in electing Trump in 2016.

**A Clear Message for the UAW and Biden’s Policies**

In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump made his feelings clear about Biden’s electric vehicle strategy, suggesting it adversely affects UAW members. "AUTOWORKERS, VOTE FOR TRUMP – I’LL MAKE YOU VICTORIOUS & RICH," Trump emphasized, urging workers to reconsider any allegiance to leaders who do not prioritize their interests.

Trump's message is clear: he stands firmly with the American working class. As the former President champions the cause of auto workers in Detroit, it becomes evident that his commitment to the everyday American remains undiminished.
