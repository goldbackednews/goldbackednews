In a growing scandal that could have wide-reaching implications, Arabella Advisors, the largest Democratic dark money network in the U.S., is being accused of financial improprieties. The IRS complaint alleges that its founder, Eric Kessler, a former appointee of President Clinton, may have illicitly benefited from its complex configuration.

On the front lines of this expose is the Americans for Public Trust (APT). This organization, on Tuesday, brought forward an IRS complaint against entities under the Arabella Advisors umbrella. This Washington, D.C. consulting firm is notorious for overseeing several nonprofits that act as fiscal sponsors for myriad left-wing dark money groups. Its purported connection to Kessler and its subsequent financial practices have now been cast into the spotlight.

Caitlin Sutherland, APT's executive director, didn't mince words, stating, "Eric Kessler created one of the most complex and sophisticated dark money networks influencing U.S. politics and policy today. The IRS must investigate whether he misdirected nonprofit funds back into his own coffers through Arabella Advisors."

Arabella Advisors plays a central role in the administration of four major nonprofits, which in turn host a multitude of liberal organizations. Among them is one that collaboratively works on policies with the Biden administration. Due to the nature of Arabella's setup, many of these nonprofits bypass filing tax records to the IRS. This conveniently obscures their financial details and donor information, effectively leaving the public blind to the extent of the network's operations.

Interestingly, both Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and George Soros are known to have channeled money into the Arabella network. Confidential documents from the Democracy Alliance, a covert donor club for the left, have also revealed financial transactions with the network.

The complaint by APT is a clarion call for the IRS to delve into the tax-exempt status of the Arabella-managed nonprofits. Over the years, these entities have compensated Arabella Advisors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The central figure, Kessler, has played a foundational role in each of the four funds.

As per the complaint, "There are serious questions as to whether the Kessler-Affiliated Nonprofits have directly diverted substantial portions of their income and assets for the personal benefit of Mr. Kessler."

The APT is urging the IRS to meticulously inspect the activities and practices of the Kessler-Affiliated Nonprofits. If these allegations prove accurate, regulatory actions and potential criminal prosecution could be on the horizon.

Arabella Advisors' spokesperson, Steve Sampson, has countered these claims, branding the complaint as "meritless." He asserts that Arabella Advisors remains a dedicated business that accentuates philanthropic efficiency and effectiveness.

In his words, "We are compensated in exchange for a series of robust administrative and operational services... We remain committed as ever to helping our clients achieve their impact goals; frivolous allegations won’t deter us."

Only time will reveal the truth, as this financial web continues to unravel.
