A 31-year-old freelance model and real estate agent, Maleesa Mooney, was found dead inside her refrigerator last month. Her wrists and ankles were bound, and her body bore the brutal marks of a violent altercation. This gruesome discovery has sent shockwaves through the community, as authorities and loved ones alike scramble for answers.

Maleesa Mooney, a shining star with a promising career in both modeling and real estate, was last seen alive on surveillance footage in her apartment complex on September 6. Six days later, her lifeless body was discovered by the police, responding to a welfare check requested by her distraught family. They had been unable to reach Mooney for over 24 hours, sparking concerns for her safety.

When the police and building management accessed her residence at the Bunker Hill Towers Apartments, they were met with a horrifying scene. Mooney's body was wedged inside her refrigerator, severely beaten, and with a gag made of clothing stuffed in her mouth. Electrical cords and clothing bound her extremities. Blood was found outside the refrigerator, and the apartment bore signs of a violent struggle.

The autopsy report, released last Friday, confirmed the brutal nature of Mooney’s demise. She had suffered from blunt force trauma, evidenced by abrasions, lacerations, contusions, and a fractured rib. While none of the injuries were acutely life-threatening on their own, the examiner noted that they indicated a violent physical altercation prior to her death. Suffocation may have played a role, and traces of cocaine were found in her system.

Despite the intensive ongoing investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, the man seen entering Mooney’s apartment remains unidentified, and no arrests have been made. The authorities have not publicly named any suspects, leaving the community and Mooney’s family in a state of anguish and uncertainty.

Maleesa Mooney is remembered by her sister, Jourdin Pauline, as “the most amazing girl ever,” a sentiment echoed by all who knew her. Mooney, who was in the process of closing deals on million-dollar homes, is described as kind-hearted, intelligent, and genuinely caring. Her tragic and untimely death has left a void in the hearts of her family, friends, and the community.

In these trying times, the call for justice grows louder. Mooney’s family and friends have taken to social media, using the hashtag #JUSTICEFORMALEESA, to demand answers and action. The community stands united in their grief, urging anyone with information to come forward and assist in solving this heinous crime.

In the wake of this tragedy, it is vital to remember Maleesa Mooney for the vibrant life she lived, and ensure that every effort is made to bring her killer to justice. The authorities must relentlessly pursue the truth, ensuring that justice is served and that Mooney’s family can find some semblance of peace.
