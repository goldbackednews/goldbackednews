**China’s Footprint on American Soil Raises Red Flags**

The Chinese companies buying up land on American soil are not just any companies; they have strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Rep. John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan, sees this as a ticking time bomb for U.S. national security. His warning? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen needs to recognize the grave implications of these purchases.

**The Threat in Michigan**

Earlier this year, Gotion Inc., a company deeply linked to the CCP, acquired a sizable plot of 270 acres in Michigan. Their intention is to build a $2.4 billion battery plant. Alarmingly, this location is just a stone's throw (about 100 miles) from Camp Grayling, America's most expansive National Guard training facility. 

What's even more startling? Michigan is set to offer Gotion a whopping $175 million in grants and tax exemptions that would save them a staggering $540 million over 30 years. This is taxpayer money potentially aiding a national security risk.

**Demand for Tighter Scrutiny**

Rep. Moolenaar, being a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, is urging for a thorough review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). This body exists to vet foreign investments in the U.S., particularly when there's a whisper of national security risk. "National security is at stake," Moolenaar emphasizes.

Together with Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Moolenaar penned a letter to Yellen. Their clear-cut request? Block companies affiliated with the CCP from benefiting from the tax incentives outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Gotion, attempting to circumvent full oversight, has requested a CFIUS review—but solely on the land buy, excluding their actual plans for the acquired territory.

**A Pattern of Concerns**

This is not an isolated incident. Last year, the Fufeng Group, another firm tied to the CCP, had intentions to acquire 300 acres near the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. Though CFIUS claimed a lack of jurisdiction to scrutinize the deal, the U.S. military rightly intervened to halt the transaction.

Rep. Moolenaar fervently hopes for the Treasury Department's proactive engagement this time. In his words, "This isn't mere business. It's about the very heart of our national security."
