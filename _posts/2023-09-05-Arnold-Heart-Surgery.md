Arnold Schwarzenegger, the iconic star known for his legendary roles and unparalleled zeal, recently shed light on the nightmarish, near-death experience following a severely botched heart operation in 2018.

This unnerving revelation came during a candid conversation with Fox News Digital where Schwarzenegger recalled waking up to the shocking news that what was intended to be a non-invasive surgery had inadvertently turned life-threatening. "I was in the middle of a disaster," Schwarzenegger lamented.

The actor and former governor of California had initially been set for a routine procedure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to replace a pulmonic valve. A complication during the procedure meant that surgeons had to act quickly, leading to emergency open-heart surgery.

A symbol of resilience, Schwarzenegger, despite being amid a health crisis, shifted his focus toward recovery and reclaiming his life. Mere weeks away from shooting "The Terminator's" sixth installment at the time, he recounted the urgency he felt to recuperate. "So you have to shift gears. You collect yourself, shift gears and say okay, ‘What I need to do now is, I got to get out of this hospital, number one,'" the actor described.

At 76, Schwarzenegger's undying spirit became evident as he took on the challenge of walking post-surgery, calling on friends to cheer him on. The motivation to get moving was two-fold; while it was integral to his recovery, the looming threat of pneumonia — which can be fatal after such procedures — further propelled him.

Not one to be subdued, Schwarzenegger dove back into training within three months, ready to take on his action-packed role in "Terminator 6." "We did it, because I had a positive attitude. I knew exactly how I'm going to get there, I had the support system...," he reflected on his journey.

Yet, the trials for the "FUBAR" actor wouldn't conclude in 2018. Come 2020, Schwarzenegger was again in the operation theatre, this time for an aortic valve replacement. Thanking his medical team at the Cleveland Clinic post-surgery, he revealed on Instagram that he felt "fantastic."

Arnold Schwarzenegger's story stands as a testament to his unyielding spirit, proving that even in the face of daunting adversities, with the right mindset and support, one can make a roaring comeback.
