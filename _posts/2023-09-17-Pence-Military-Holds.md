The Pentagon's abortion policy has stirred controversy, and now it's influencing military promotions. Former Vice President Mike Pence, eyeing the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, showed his backing for Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who's actively blocked multiple military appointments. Why? He's protesting the Pentagon's abortion policy which was introduced earlier this year.

Pence firmly stated his views during a speech on Friday. "Sen. Tommy Tuberville is right, and the Pentagon is wrong," Pence declared, committing to halt taxpayer dollars from undermining pro-life laws if he takes office. Tuberville's stance, however, has led to a six-month holdup in the Senate, affecting over 300 pending military promotions.

The protest also means that Army, Marine Corps, and Navy leaders are currently in interim positions, which curtails their authority. This occurs because of the Senate's delay in confirming them.

So, what's the Pentagon's policy that's causing this ripple? They've pledged to cover the travel costs for service members either seeking abortions or supporting their spouses during such procedures. This policy allows up to five months, or 20 weeks into a pregnancy, for service members to inform their departments and ask for travel assistance for these purposes.

Yet Pence is not alone in his support for Tuberville. Other Republicans have also echoed similar sentiments. Nevertheless, there's also criticism from both sides of the aisle and the military. For instance, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, critiqued Tuberville's strategy, saying, "holding these non-policymaking career military [officials] is a mistake." Similarly, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, pointed out the national security risks, stating Tuberville’s holds are “paralyzing the Department of Defense.”

Pence, who's been vocal about his anti-abortion stance, was the first 2024 presidential candidate to back a 15-week national abortion ban. He stated, "I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it," emphasizing his commitment to the cause.

However, the hold on promotions doesn't sit well with many. Inside sources claim it compromises national security and might even push those awaiting promotions to look for jobs outside the military. A joint op-ed by the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force emphasized the negative impact, stating, "Any claim that holding up the promotions of top officers does not directly damage the military is wrong."

With mounting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, recent polls among Alabama voters suggest that the majority would prefer Tuberville to end his block on military promotions.
