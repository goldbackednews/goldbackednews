The **battle over birthright citizenship** is intensifying within the Republican party as the majority of GOP Presidential candidates have rallied behind the idea of abolishing the policy of awarding citizenship to all children born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

### **Anchor Babies - A Central Issue**
Every year, approximately 400,000 children are born in the United States to parents who are illegal immigrants. These children, often referred to as "anchor babies," receive U.S. citizenship by birthright, anchoring their families to the United States for generations. This practice has sparked controversy and debate, especially among Republicans, with some viewing it as a magnet for illegal immigration and a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment.

During recent debates, prominent GOP candidates such as Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump have explicitly stated their intentions to **end birthright citizenship**, a policy that seems to resonate with a significant number of Republican voters. A 2021 Cato Institute survey revealed that more than 60% of GOP voters oppose birthright citizenship, and a 2018 Rasmussen Reports poll showed 72% opposition within the party.

### **GOP Candidates Stand United**
Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy emphasized that he would abolish birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. He highlighted the importance of reading and interpreting the 14th Amendment correctly, stating, "What it says is that ‘all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the laws and jurisdictions thereof are citizens.’"

Former President Donald Trump, consistent with his stance since 2015, proclaimed that he would sign an executive order to abolish the policy on the first day of his term, if re-elected.

Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has included ending birthright citizenship as part of his presidential bid's official immigration platform, pledging action against the “major driver of illegal migration.” Nikki Haley and other Republican personalities have also expressed their opposition to the policy, although not outlining explicit plans to end it.

### **Differing Interpretations and Implications**
The 14th Amendment was originally drafted concerning slaves, not illegal immigrants, but over time, it has been applied to illegal immigration. The ongoing debate centers around whether individuals who enter the U.S. illegally are truly under the jurisdiction of U.S. laws and whether their U.S.-born children should automatically receive citizenship.

Ending birthright citizenship would align the United States with several other developed nations like Australia, France, and New Zealand, which reserve citizenship for children with at least one citizen parent. However, any moves to end this policy are likely to face stiff resistance and legal battles, with opponents arguing such changes would violate the Constitution.

### **Conclusion**
The united front presented by GOP candidates on the birthright citizenship debate reveals a significant shift in the party's stance, echoing the sentiments of a majority of Republican voters. However, despite the newfound consensus within the party, any concrete moves to abolish birthright citizenship are bound to stir controversy and ignite fierce legal and constitutional battles, with the Supreme Court possibly having the final say in this contentious issue. Whether this shared stance will translate into actual policy change remains to be seen, but it’s clear that the debate over birthright citizenship is far from over.
