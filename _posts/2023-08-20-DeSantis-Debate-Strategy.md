MANCHESTER, N.H. – **Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis** is gearing up and assuring he's "ready to do what we need to" at the anticipated GOP presidential debate this Wednesday.

Brushing off the leaked debate strategy memo from his aligned super PAC, Never Back Down, DeSantis clarified to Fox News Digital, "the memo is not mine. I haven’t read it." The memo had made waves in the media and political circles, particularly after the New York Times reported its existence, which hinted at DeSantis's possible debate strategies.

The leaked document had several eyebrow-raising recommendations, most notably advising DeSantis to defend former President **Donald Trump** if the latter comes under fire during the debate. It also signaled an intention to challenge rising GOP candidate **Vivek Ramaswamy**. But for DeSantis, this leak is merely a distraction, stating, "It’s just something we have put off to the side."

Following a string of challenges that saw his campaign grappling with overspending, leadership changes, and staff layoffs, DeSantis is eager to rewrite the narrative. And while Trump's lead has widened over the summer, DeSantis still holds his ground as a top contender, ranking second in numerous polls.

DeSantis's campaign shed light on the imminent first debate hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, emphasizing that every participant would likely target the Florida Governor. A confident DeSantis remarked, "I know from the military, when you’re over the target, that’s when you’re taking flak." Drawing attention to the frequent criticisms he's faced in recent times from various quarters, he said, "And there’s a reason for that, because people know that I’m the biggest threat."

When asked about his potential debate tactics, the governor's response was clear: he plans to defend his position and showcase his vision for America. "Yes, that means defending ourselves but more importantly showing why we are the leader to get this country turned around," DeSantis affirmed.

In another twist, a new memo distributed to donors and supporters by **James Uthmeier**, the newly appointed campaign manager, indicated that DeSantis is primed for the "center of attacks" during the debate. However, the Governor is not fazed.

Amidst the political turmoil, DeSantis remains on the ground, engaging in grassroots campaigning. His recent participation in Londonderry, New Hampshire's annual Old Home Day Parade, and interactions with popular Republican governor **Chris Sununu** of New Hampshire, show his commitment to retail politics, a method he believes is pivotal in narrowing the gap with Trump.

Sununu, having collaborated with various Republican presidential hopefuls, commented positively on DeSantis's prospects. "Of course, Gov. DeSantis can turn it around in New Hampshire," Sununu noted, pointing out the impressive crowd DeSantis gathered, "he’s working it on the ground, doing the retail politics."

With the debate nearing, all eyes are on DeSantis and how he will navigate the political chessboard amidst the mounting pressures and challenges.
