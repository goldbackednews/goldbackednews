Amidst the chaos of the cartel battles brewing near the Texas border, a critical arrest was made. One of the Gulf Cartelâ€™s top enforcers in Reynosa, Roque "Rocky, Metro 58 or Comandante Roque" Cruz Fuentes, known for his leadership in the Metros faction's security forces, is now behind bars.

On an early Thursday morning, Mexican Navy's elite force, popularly referred to as Marinos, established strategic perimeters across the Las Fuentes and Olmitos neighborhoods. This was the backdrop for the meticulously executed raids targeting Roque and his operations. 

Throughout the operation, three helicopters, armed with sharpshooters, blanketed the skies, providing invaluable air support. Simultaneously, a diversionary raid was underway, a strategic move to distract and deter any gunmen attempting to intervene and rescue their leader. 

However, the arrest wasn't the only significant outcome of this operation. Authorities, during their mission, successfully liberated a woman kidnapped and held by El Roque in his hideout.

Following the arrest, El Roque, along with eight of his armed associates, was swiftly transported to Matamoros. There, at the local Mexico Attorney General's Office, the processing began. Post-processing, they were then moved to Mexico City, where El Roque is slated to face a federal judge.

Breitbart Texas' law enforcement sources have disclosed that El Roque, as a high-ranking member of Los Metros, was implicated in an extensive list of violent acts. From orchestrating shootouts to commissioning a slew of kidnappings and murders, his actions were part of a larger ongoing feud with the Matamoros faction of the Gulf Cartel, known as Los Escorpiones.

This arrest marks a significant step in curbing the violence and dominance of cartel factions in the region. But as history has shown, the ever-resilient cartels often bounce back, potentially escalating the tension in the already volatile borderlands.
