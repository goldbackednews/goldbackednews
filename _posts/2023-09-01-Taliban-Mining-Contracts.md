In a significant move towards tapping Afghanistan's vast mineral resources, the Taliban has reportedly inked deals worth over $6.5 billion with Chinese, British, and Turkish corporations. This move, announced at a press conference on August 31, grants these international companies access to seven of Afghanistan's major mines, known for their reserves of gold, iron, and lead.

### A Geopolitical Gamble

This move by the Taliban indicates a growing confidence in their capacity to govern and engage with foreign corporations, even as they remain a non-recognized governing body on the international stage. Afghanistan, believed to house approximately $3 trillion in untouched mineral riches, has been under the complete control of the Taliban since August 2021.

While the global community condemned the Taliban's sudden return to power, their actions, particularly in signing billion-dollar contracts with corporations from nations like China, reflect an unexpected shift. This shift undermines calls from allies to release Afghan government funds held internationally and to lift sanctions, all in the name of offering humanitarian support to Afghanistan's populace.

### Digging Deeper

Among the notable deals:

- China-Afghanistan Company has taken over gold mines in Takhar province with an investment of $310 million.
- The British firms GBM and AD Resources, in partnership with Afghan corporation Shamsh, have invested $572 million into a section of the iron mine in Ghoryan. Meanwhile, another part of the Ghoryan mine will now fall under Turkish control through the corporation Epcol.
- Iran's Ehya Sepahan and Parsian corporations have earmarked a whopping $1.17-billion investment into a different section of the expansive Ghoryan mine.

The Taliban’s own news agency, Bakhtar, highlighted the initiative of the Mines and Petroleum Industry to invite various foreign investors to partner with the Taliban and make profits from Afghanistan's mineral resources.

### The China Connection

China's continuous support of the Taliban stands out starkly. This support was evident when they celebrated the two-year fall of Kabul in August, praising the jihadists for their efforts in sectors like "economic development" and "improvement of people's livelihoods."

Post their conquest of Kabul, the Taliban had identified China as a prime economic ally, continuously showcasing the Communist Party's burgeoning economic clout in the country. Agreements with China to extract Afghan oil, erect vast factories on Afghan land, and deploy advanced surveillance systems for better control over the Afghan population are just the tip of the iceberg.

Furthermore, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a strategic infrastructure initiative targeting poorer nations with hefty loans for infrastructure projects, has found a supporter in the Taliban. The terrorist group officially joined BRI in May.

### Concluding Thoughts

With these mining contracts, the Taliban is not just aiming to exploit the nation's mineral wealth but is also signaling its readiness to play ball on the international economic field. Whether this will translate into more countries recognizing and engaging with the Taliban remains to be seen.
