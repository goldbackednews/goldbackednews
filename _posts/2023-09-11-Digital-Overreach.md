European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent push for global digital ID systems, akin to coronavirus passports, at the G20 Summit's "One Future" session has ignited fierce debates. While she touts them as the future of global digital infrastructure, many view these initiatives as a grave step towards omnipresent surveillance, eroding personal freedoms and privacy.

The digital era, although prosperous and convenient, comes with significant challenges. One of the most alarming is the potential to turn tools meant for connectivity into tools of control. Von der Leyen's endorsement of a global regulatory body for Artificial Intelligence (AI) — mirroring the structure of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — raises the question: who gets to set the standards, and how will they be enforced?

von der Leyen praised the European Union's development of a coronavirus digital certificate, pointing out its adoption by 51 countries across four continents. While she sees this as a testament to its functionality and trustworthiness, many fear that such widespread adoption of a single digital ID system puts immense power in the hands of few and reduces the anonymity and privacy of individuals.

The European Union’s ongoing effort to introduce a "digital identity" app, aiming to consolidate a citizen's essential data, including passport details, driver's license, and credit cards, has added fuel to the fire. Given that such information is a treasure trove for cybercriminals, the security implications alone are staggering. But more so, the app's existence could provide governments with unprecedented access to personal information, raising the specter of an Orwellian future.

Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes’s warning earlier this year resounds even more today. He termed the digital ID system push as potentially leading to the "Chinafication" of Europe. Drawing parallels with Communist China's surveillance mechanisms, Terhes’s statement underscores concerns that Europe might be on a similar trajectory, sacrificing privacy at the altar of supposed convenience.

The EU’s plan to potentially introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) further intensifies these apprehensions. Beyond the economic implications, a CBDC could provide an infrastructure for governments to monitor, and possibly control, individual financial transactions, curtailing financial freedom.

While digital transformation and global standardization have undeniable merits, the cost of personal freedom and privacy should be paramount. As the line between connectivity and control blurs, one must ask: are we inadvertently laying the foundation for a digital dystopia?
