Under the ostensibly ineffective leadership of Mayor Brandon Johnson, Chicago faced a harrowing weekend where at least 19 individuals became victims of gunfire, with two succumbing to their injuries. This surge in violence serves as a distressing testament to the city's deteriorating safety conditions.

On Friday evening, the ABC 7 / Chicago Sun-Times shed light on the beginning of the tragic weekend spree. Around 6:30 p.m., in an alley in the "10200 block of South Carpenter Street," a 43-year-old man was ruthlessly shot in the chest and head, leading to his immediate death.

Saturday didn’t bring any reprieve. By 10:45 a.m., in the "1500 block of East 74th Street," a group targeted a young couple, a 23-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, resulting in the tragic death of the woman. The man, although wounded, refused medical aid.

The alarming frequency of these incidents brings to the forefront the pressing questions about Mayor Johnson's capabilities. A database from the Sun-Times underscores this dire scenario, highlighting that from January 1, 2023, to date, 455 individuals have lost their lives to gun violence in Chicago.

The overwhelming spike in crime under Mayor Johnson's watch is not just a statistic—it's an alarming reality for the city's residents. These continual violent outbreaks are prompting both local and national discussions, questioning Mayor Johnson's strategies and effectiveness in addressing the escalating gun violence.

As the Windy City yearns for safety and stability, there is a rising demand for better leadership, one that can offer tangible solutions and restore peace to the beleaguered streets of Chicago.
