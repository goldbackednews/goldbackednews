While age limits for politicians are gaining traction in public discourse, former President Donald Trump has a different take. Instead of focusing on age, he believes competency tests would be more beneficial.

In a recent interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," Trump, at age 77, shared his views. He responded to host Kristen Welker's questions about age limits, especially since Trump and current President Joe Biden, who's 80, are potential opponents in the 2024 elections.

Recalling a test he took a few years ago at Walter Reed, Trump said, "I aced it. I get everything right. I’m all for testing. I frankly think testing would be a good thing." But is it constitutional? The former president believes some might see it that way, though he isn't certain.

Trump added, "[You] know, some of the greatest world leaders have been in their 80s. I’m not anywhere very near 80, by the way." He emphasized that it's not about Biden's age but his competence, which he sees as a bigger concern.

But what about Trump's age? If he wins the 2024 elections, he'll be nearing 80 in his term. Biden, if re-elected, would be 82 at the beginning of his next term. Biden's age has been a frequent topic of discussion due to occasional lapses in memory and stuttered speeches.

Another vocal advocate for competency testing is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. She's been proactive in pushing for cognitive tests for politicians, particularly for those over 75. Notably, she hasn't supported age limits. Mockingly referring to the U.S. Senate as "the most privileged nursing home in the country," she called for legislation that would require competency tests for both presidential candidates and Congress members.

Haley's comments came in the wake of health concerns involving Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Discussing their health episodes, she remarked, "It's sad. No one should feel good about seeing that."

In the upcoming 2024 Republican Presidential Primary, Haley is set to challenge Trump. However, current polls indicate Trump's lead over other candidates remains significant. Despite this, Trump voiced his appreciation for the idea of a female vice president, assuring that he would "pick the best person."

The debate around age and competence is unlikely to subside, especially as the 2024 elections approach. But one thing is clear: the need for efficient and competent leadership is paramount, no matter the age.
