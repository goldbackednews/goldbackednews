Amidst ongoing global tensions, President Joe Biden's administration is said to be weighing a substantial assistance package for two key allies: Ukraine and Israel. A trusted source revealed on Wednesday that Biden is considering $60 billion in aid for Ukraine and an additional $10 billion for Israel.

The motivation behind this potential aid stems from recent international incidents. Israel, on one side, is recovering from the October 7 attack led by Hamas militants. On the other, Ukraine continues to confront the challenges posed by a Russian invasion. The U.S., as a longstanding supporter of both nations, seeks to bolster their positions during these difficult times.

While Biden's commitment to these allies is evident, he is also believed to be exploring a broader supplemental request of approximately $100 billion. This would not only fortify Israel and Ukraine but also extend defense aid to Taiwan. Moreover, part of this funding aims to enhance security measures along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Sen. Jim Risch, a leading Republican voice on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed unfamiliarity with the $100 billion figure outside of news coverage. However, he acknowledged hearing rumors of the administration's $10 billion consideration for Israel.

As of now, it remains uncertain what the final figures will look like, as Biden has yet to settle on definitive numbers. Furthermore, the administration has not shared a detailed breakdown with Congress.

However, it's crucial to note that, under U.S. legislation, Congress holds the purse strings and controls expenditures, not the executive branch. This means that, irrespective of Biden's proposals, Congress will have the final say on the distribution of these funds.

As the world watches closely, the forthcoming days will shed more light on how the U.S. plans to back its allies in their hour of need and the role Congress will play in these pivotal decisions.
