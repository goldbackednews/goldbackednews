In a fierce rebuke of California's recent legislative move, Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott labeled a bill penalizing parents who do not affirm their transgender children as "evil."

The contentious bill, AB 957, freshly passed by the California State Assembly, has come under intense scrutiny. This legislation obliges judges in child custody cases to evaluate if a parent has recognized and affirmed their child’s transgender identity. The core proposition of the bill originally intended courts to see whether parents were gender-affirming. A subsequent amendment further tightened these stipulations. It laid down that to be adjudged as fit parents in a court of law, acknowledgment and affirmation of a child's gender identity become essential.

Tim Scott, a stalwart defender of parental rights, voiced his profound dismay at this measure. He articulated, "_The radical Left is on a mission to make parents less important. They believe your kids belong to them._" He further pledged his unwavering commitment to reversing this narrative by emphatically stating, "_I will fight back, put parents back in charge, and shield the next generation of children from such overreach._"

Previously, Senator Scott unveiled an extensive plan aimed at safeguarding children and empowering families. Central to his "Empower Parents Plan" is the establishment of a robust family-first culture. Scott, the Senate's only Black Republican, is resolute in championing traditional values. He stresses the significance of allowing children to grow naturally, free from societal pressures about their gender identities.

In addition to this, Scott demands that parents be granted unrestricted access to their children’s educational content, ensuring they are privy to all materials their children are exposed to in schools. A fervent advocate for school choice, Scott envisions weakening the stranglehold of teachers' unions. He ardently supports granting parents a more substantial say in choosing the educational path best suited for their children, whether that's public, private, charter, STEM schools, or homeschooling.

In a succinct summation of his educational vision, Scott declared his intent to "_replace indoctrination with education. ABC, not CRT._" With unwavering dedication to parental rights and a clear vision for America's educational future, Senator Tim Scott continues to shape the discourse on this critical issue.
