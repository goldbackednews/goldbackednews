A grave turn of events has gripped Oklahoma as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations (OSBI), supported by multiple law enforcement agencies, spearheads a manhunt for Kameron Jenkins, a 25-year-old suspect. Jenkins is implicated in the alleged shooting of a Cleveland County deputy and the inadvertent killing of a motorist due to a stray bullet.

The incident transpired during what started as a regular traffic stop, but quickly escalated into a chase. This altercation took place near the 60-mile marker of Interstate 35. The injured deputy, after being shot, was promptly airlifted to a nearby medical facility where he has been reported to be in stable condition. However, the incident took a tragic turn when an uninvolved motorist was fatally hit by a stray bullet, believed to be from the suspect's firearm as he was shooting at the police.

Kameron Jenkins, currently the focal point of this intensive manhunt, has been described by the OSBI as a Black man standing at approximately 6-foot-4, weighing around 170â€“200 pounds. Distinctive features include his black dreadlocks and brown eyes. The last outfit he was seen wearing was a white shirt. The severity of the situation is underlined by warnings from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol, emphasizing that Jenkins is not only armed and dangerous but may also be carrying a semi-automatic weapon.

Local news outlet FOX 25 in Oklahoma City shed further light, mentioning that Jenkins might be in a white trailer towed by a black pickup truck.

Diving deeper into Jenkins' past, his criminal record presents several red flags. In 2015, he faced a maiming charge which was eventually dismissed. By 2017, he pleaded guilty to assault and battery charges. Not stopping there, Jenkins also entered guilty pleas for DUI and marijuana-related charges in 2019.

Law enforcement agencies are urging citizens to exercise extreme caution. The prevailing advice for anyone who spots Jenkins or has information about his whereabouts is to promptly call 911. Engaging with Jenkins or attempting to approach him can be perilous due to his considered armed and potentially volatile status.

This event has sent shockwaves across Oklahoma, with residents anxiously hoping for a swift resolution and the prevention of further incidents. With the collective efforts of the OSBI and other enforcement agencies, the goal remains to bring Jenkins into custody and ensure the safety of the public.
