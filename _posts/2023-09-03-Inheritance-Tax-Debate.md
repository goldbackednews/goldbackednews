Former Vice President Mike Pence has leveled heavy criticism against Vivek Ramaswamy for his proposal to increase inheritance taxes to 59%. In a conversation with Newsmax, Pence described this move as "the last thing we should do in the wake of Joe Biden's failed economic policies."

During the "America Right Now" segment on Saturday, Pence pointedly remarked, "The American people deserve to know that he's advocated in the last year for a 59% inheritance tax." This stern reprimand follows a charged face-off between the two Republican presidential candidates during the initial GOP debate held in Milwaukee.

Emphasizing his anti-tax stance, Pence shared, "When I was governor of Indiana, we cut income taxes and we also completely eliminated death taxes in Indiana." He vowed to uphold these fiscal principles if he were to be elected president, stressing that elections are all about choices. "I'm looking forward to being on that debate stage in California and will continue to draw a bright contrast between the failed policies of the Biden administration and my vision for America, but also between all the candidates on that stage," Pence added.

Ramaswamy, in his book "Nation of Victims," highlights the significance of potent inheritance and real estate taxes. He posits that a substantial inheritance tax, devoid of any significant loopholes, establishes a robust meritocratic society. He writes, "People have an incentive to work hard and innovate during their lifetimes, but their children must start fresh, without getting to ride on their parents' coattails."

Last week, Ramaswamy's campaign countered Pence's assertions, arguing that the former Vice President never delved into Ramaswamy's book. Ramaswamy's communications director, Tricia McLaughlin, clarified to NBC News, "Vivek supports a 12% flat tax across the board, while eliminating cronyist deductions and loopholes." She emphasized Ramaswamy's innovative approach, mentioning, "Vivek laid out a mathematical calculation on how to fully eliminate the federal income tax, which wasn't even constitutional for most of its history. Vivek is an intellectual, not a partisan hack, so he explores ideas."

The heated back-and-forth between Pence and Ramaswamy is a clear indication of the passion and differing visions each candidate brings to the table. As the presidential campaign progresses, these tax policy disagreements are likely to remain at the forefront of the debate.
