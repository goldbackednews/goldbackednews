The potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) by President Joe Biden has been a topic of heated debate recently. A new poll indicates that a majority of U.S. adults believe that President Biden did, in fact, breach these rules, allegedly through bribery schemes in overseas business engagements via his son, Hunter Biden.

According to a recent poll released by the Daily Mail, 63% of respondents believe that Joe Biden violated the FARA regulations during his tenure as vice president. The act requires individuals to publicly declare their foreign affiliations and register as agents. Of the respondents, 29% opined that Biden hadn't infringed upon the FARA directives, while 8% remained uncertain.

The political affiliation of respondents played a significant role in their opinions. Though the majority belief transcended party lines, 38% of Democrats also felt that the president was implicated in the alleged underhanded dealings, which came to light due to an FD-1023 informant document released the previous month.

Hunter Biden's foreign affairs were scrutinized even more intensely. A striking 69% of the respondents believed that he violated FARA rules, with only 18% in his favor and 13% remaining neutral.

This poll, which encompassed the opinions of 542 U.S. adults, was orchestrated by TIPP Insights from August 2 to 4. It specifically targeted individuals familiar with the testimonies of Devon Archer, a former business associate of Hunter Biden. Archer's revelations to the House Oversight Committee in July insinuated that President Biden was intricately involved in his son's overseas business strategies. He hinted at the "Biden brand" being utilized as a negotiation tool in various deals.

It's essential to note that this poll's results come with a margin of error of approximately 4.3 percentage points.
