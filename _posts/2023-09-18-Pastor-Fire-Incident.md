Shawnee, a tranquil suburb in Kansas, was rattled by shocking news involving a local youth pastor's alleged violent actions against his family. Matthew Richards, 41, stands accused of attempting to kill his wife and five children in their home. Following the alleged attack, he is also charged with attempting to set the residence on fire.

The harrowing incident occurred on September 16, when emergency services responded to alerts of a disturbance and fire around 3:47 a.m. Upon arriving, firefighters tackled a blaze in the basement of the family home located on Goode Drive. 

Richards and all the victims were rushed to the hospital. According to the Shawnee Police Department's press release, the five children and the wife sustained "laceration injuries of varying degrees."

The aftermath has left Richards with five counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder and one count of aggravated arson with a risk of bodily harm. 

### An Unexpected Turn

The Crossroads Christian Church, where Richards was employed, showcases a heartwarming biography of him on their website. He is described as "a big kid who loves teaching little kids about Jesus." The biography paints a contrasting picture, highlighting his marriage to Stephanie since 2003, their five children, and the family's three rules â€“ emphasizing love for God, people, and sports. 

In light of the shocking incident, the Senior Pastor of Crossroads Church, Kurt Witten, issued a statement requesting respect for the ongoing investigation and urging prayers for the Richards family.

### Investigation and Legal Proceedings

As investigations proceed, the community struggles to come to terms with the shocking event involving a figure once revered by many. Richards is currently being held on a staggering $5 million bond.
