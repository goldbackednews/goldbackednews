Disney, a name that once stood for family-friendly content and a whole lot of magic, seems to be facing its own kind of enchantment gone wrong. In the last year alone, their stock has taken a nosedive, dropping by a whopping 27 percent. And if we turn back the pages to the days before the pandemic, Disney shares are down an astonishing 60.1 percent since their March 2021 high. What's behind this free fall?

While many factors can be attributed to a company's decline, there's a growing sentiment, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Disney's evident "woke" approach is driving away its core audience. Being "woke," in other words, pushing for a more politically correct and inclusive narrative, might sound noble to some. But is it commercially viable for a company that has historically thrived on traditional values?

Disney's decision to champion the radical LGBTQ agenda is a case in point. They haven't just integrated this into their entertainment content but have also been vocal about it in the political sphere. Their feud with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis (R), over this issue is testimony to their unabashed political stand. While the debate on LGBTQ rights is a broader one, should a children's entertainment company be the one leading the charge? 

Another red flag has been the allegations and lawsuits against Disney. They stand accused of misleading investors about Disney+'s financial health. For a company that's been a household name, such claims do a number on investor trust.

But it's not just the woke politics. The shift to streaming, which most saw as the next frontier for entertainment, has also not panned out for Disney as they'd hoped. They've invested heavily, but with a string of box-office flops and consistent streaming losses, it's clear that they might have missed the mark.

CEO Bob Iger's apparent plans to offload many of Disney's TV properties further show the turmoil within. With traditional cable TV no longer as profitable, thanks to many opting out, the company seems to be in a mad scramble.

For the MAGA folks, this could be a warning bell for other corporations. The message? Stick to what you're good at and be wary of adopting every trending political agenda. After all, as Disney's tumble shows, even giants can falter when they lose sight of their core audience and values.
