In an unforeseen twist to a heart-rending 23-year-old kidnapping cold case, the primary suspect is now believed to be an innocent missing individual, just like her own daughter.

West Virginia's decades-old narrative pivots around the mysterious disappearance of 10-year-old Natasha "Alex" Carter in 2000. Initial suspicions, fueled by FBI wanted posters and a $10,000 reward, landed heavily on Susan Gail Carter, her mother. Susan was believed to have abducted her daughter amidst a strained custody dispute. Evidence for these suspicions included Susan's purported declaration to her husband, Rick Lafferty, that he'd never again see their daughter. Further, the child's grandmother's testimony indicated that young Natasha was fearful of her own mother.

However, the investigation's entire trajectory shifted recently. Fresh evidence unearthed by the West Virginia State Police suggests that both mother and daughter may have vanished simultaneously. 

State police, along with the FBI, acted on new intelligence to execute search warrants at the Carter family's last known Raleigh County residence. The FBI has confirmed the acquisition of "additional forensic evidence," but details remain closely guarded.

Larry Dell Webb owned the property under investigation. Post the police's sweep, Terry Lilly, Webb's caretaker, allowed journalists access to the premises. The Register Herald's accounts highlighted removed sections of drywall and extracted tile flooring, possibly hinting at concealed evidence or a grisly scene.

Susan was 41 when she vanished, while Natasha, known by her middle name "Alex," was only 10. The duo's disappearance took place shortly after moving in with Susan's new spouse. West Virginia State Police's statement clarified that what started as an alleged kidnapping by Susan Carter has now morphed into a dual missing persons case since August 8, 2000.

Desperate for leads, law enforcement has doubled the previous reward, now offering $20,000 for crucial information leading to the whereabouts of the Carters.

Highlighting the case's national significance, "In Pursuit with John Walsh" featured it in a 2022 episode. Calls to action urge anyone with pertinent information to step forward and contact the West Virginia State Police Beckley Detachment.

This chilling tale underscores the complexities and often unforeseen turns in long-standing cold cases. The quest for truth continues.
