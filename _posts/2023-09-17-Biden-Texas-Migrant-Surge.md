The Texas border town of Eagle Pass experienced an extraordinary and concerning day when, in just 24 hours, over 1,300 migrants were apprehended. This number surpassed the combined total from all eleven El Paso Border Patrol Sector stations, highlighting a serious surge in this small town.

### A Strained System

Eagle Pass, with a population of only around 30,000 residents, is feeling the pressure. The apprehensions in a single day have overwhelmed the town's Border Patrol processing facility and the ability of non-government (NGO) shelters to accommodate such a surge. This immense inflow has left the local system stretched thin, with one source noting, "In just one eight-hour shift, more than 700 migrants were taken into custody. We lack the capacity to deal with it. This system is broken."

### Overburdened Facilities

With only one soft-sided processing facility operating in the area, the number of detained migrants skyrocketed to over 3,000. This volume is three times its designated capacity. Unfortunately, this overload prompted the Border Patrol to conduct mass releases into the town. Migrants, without sufficient funds for travel, were observed attempting the daunting walk from Eagle Pass to San Antonio, Texas, a journey spanning over 150 miles.

### A Failing Response

The strategy from the top seems disconnected from the ground reality. Instead of effectively addressing the growing crisis, the response appears to be one of surrender. "Our facilities are full, the NGO shelters have exceeded their capacity as well, and we are releasing every migrant we can just to stay afloat," an inside source shared.

Local residents are feeling the brunt of this surge firsthand. Migrants wander the city streets, lacking funds for bus tickets or meals. The only NGO shelter, Mission Border Hope, has had to turn away migrants who can't afford the $50 bus ticket to San Antonio. This situation puts these migrants in an even more vulnerable position, expecting them to travel hundreds of miles without adequate resources.

While the town's Border Patrol aims to release migrants to the shelter, intending to prevent adding to the homeless population, the lack of proper planning and infrastructure has made this a losing strategy. "We had no knowledge that the poorest of migrants would be thrown out on the streets and expected to walk more than 150 miles to the next largest city, but that is where we are," the source added.

It's evident that Eagle Pass, and Texas at large, needs an effective solution that addresses the immediate concerns of overwhelmed facilities and the long-term implications of mass releases into small towns. At the core of this crisis is the Biden administration, which must acknowledge its role and take definitive action to mend this worsening situation.
