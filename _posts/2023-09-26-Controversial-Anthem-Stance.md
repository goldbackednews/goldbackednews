Megan Rapinoe, the now-former captain of the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT), left the soccer field amidst heated discussions and debates, refusing to put her hand over her heart or sing the national anthem during her final game.

### A Silent Defiance
On September 24, the USWNT played against South Africa in Chicago’s Soldier Field, and as the game commenced with the national anthems for both countries being played, Rapinoe chose to stand in silent protest. Most of her teammates followed the tradition of placing their hands over their hearts and singing along with the anthem, but Rapinoe’s stance remained unchanged from her past displays of protest.

### A Prolonged Protest
Rapinoe’s silent and defiant stance during the national anthem isn’t new. She had vowed in 2019 never to sing the anthem again or respect the United States in this traditional manner. She openly called herself “a walking protest when it comes to the Trump administration” and expressed her views strongly against the inequalities and the policies of the administration. “It would take a lot” for her to stop her demonstrations, she said, pointing out the need for significant reforms in criminal justice, LGBTQ rights, and addressing the massive inequality gap in the country.

### The Final Game
Despite the controversies, Rapinoe was honored for her illustrious career ahead of Sunday’s game with a framed jersey reading “Rapinoe, 203 CAPS.” The USWNT secured a 2-0 win against South Africa, allowing Rapinoe to retire on a victorious note.

### The Debate Continues
Rapinoe’s refusal to sing the anthem or place her hand over her heart sparked significant discussions and debates. While some see it as an expression of her right to free speech and a form of protest against perceived injustices, others perceive it as a lack of respect for the country and its symbols.

### Conclusion
Megan Rapinoe’s illustrious soccer career and her silent protests have made her a polarizing figure in sports and beyond. While her talent on the field is unquestionable, her deliberate and unapologetic stance on the national anthem continues to stir controversy and provoke thought about the values and the rights we hold dear in this nation. Whether one agrees or disagrees with her form of protest, it undeniably fosters discussions on patriotism, freedom of speech, and the changes that are needed in the society.
