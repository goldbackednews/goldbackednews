The American electorate seems increasingly disenchanted with President Joe Biden’s approach towards the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. A recent Wall Street Journal poll indicates that a majority of American voters, 52 percent to be exact, disapprove of his handling of the situation. This number marks an increase from a previous poll in late March which had pegged disapproval at 46 percent.

While the exact issues of contention were not detailed in the poll, there appears to be a common sentiment that the US is perhaps too involved in the Ukraine crisis. A significant 38 percent of respondents felt that the US was offering excessive assistance to Ukraine. In comparison, 31 percent believed the support was just right, and a meager 22 percent opined that the US wasn't doing enough.

Partisan lines are evident in these perspectives. A dominant 62 percent of Republican primary voters felt the US was overstepping, whereas only 17 percent believed the support was adequate. A mere 14 percent among them thought more could be done.

>Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, Biden has been vocal about his commitment to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”

Recent events in the Ukraine war arena may have further shaped public opinion. Although Ukraine initiated a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russian forces, their progress hasn't matched Western expectations.

Biden's financial commitments to the crisis have also been under scrutiny. The president's recent proposal of an additional $24 billion aid for Ukraine might intensify debates. If approved, this would elevate the total US spending on the Ukraine conflict to an eye-popping $135 billion since its commencement in February 2022.

The aforementioned WSJ poll was conducted between August 24 and 30, with insights from 1,500 registered voters, and a margin of error of ±2.5 percentage points.
