Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, expressed deep concern over President Joe Biden's recent supplemental aid request to Congress. This proposal includes humanitarian assistance for Gaza. Blackburn's primary worry? That the aid may inadvertently fund terrorism in the region.

Blackburn shared her concerns with Fox News Digital, highlighting reports from just a week prior where Hamas, labeled a terrorist organization by multiple nations including the United States, allegedly intercepted aid. This includes essentials like food, money, medical supplies, and fuel meant for the citizens of Gaza.

This isn't the first time concerns over aid misappropriation have surfaced. The United Nations agency that oversees aid distribution to Palestinians recently reported theft of medical supplies and fuel by Hamas leaders in Gaza, although this statement was subsequently retracted.

In the emergency supplemental request presented by Biden, a whopping $105 billion is outlined. This sum is allocated for various purposes, with $9 billion specifically designated for Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza. Blackburn emphasizes the sentiment of the American majority, which she believes backs Israel. She underscores the importance of ensuring the aid genuinely reaches those in dire need.

However, Blackburn didn't stop at the concern over aid. She pointedly criticized members of the progressive "Squad" in Congress, such as Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. She accused them of behaving like "Hamas sympathizers," noting their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and resistance to increasing funds for Israel's defense.

Highlighting a broader geopolitical standpoint, Blackburn has actively called for a freeze on the $6 billion in Iranian assets. She, along with other GOP members, authored a letter addressed to Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The letter proposed splitting Biden's supplemental request into separate packages.

Why the split? The lawmakers argued that merging the aid for Israel and Ukraine could be problematic. They believe the two are distinct conflicts and should not be tied together. Bundling them could complicate the process and even risk a government shutdown, diminishing the chances of approving the funding package.

Next week promises to be crucial as Congress convenes to deliberate on Biden's supplemental request. The goal? To finalize and approve a package that the White House can endorse. Amidst political turbulence and global unrest, the journey of this aid proposal exemplifies the challenges faced in international relations and the quest for peace.
