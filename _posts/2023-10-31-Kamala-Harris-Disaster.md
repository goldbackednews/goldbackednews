Whispers of discontent within the Democratic Party are starting to become audible as party members begin to voice their concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris. For a long time, the criticism surrounding Harris’s capabilities and performance has been a topic of discussion on conservative platforms, but it appears the skepticism is now making its way into Democratic circles.

Vice President Harris has been in the political spotlight since her nomination, with expectations sky-high due to her historical position as the first female Vice President and the highest-ranking female official in U.S. history. However, her time in office has been anything but smooth, with numerous instances of questionable competence and lack of leadership. Her handling of the border crisis and inability to provide clear answers in interviews have left both the public and her colleagues doubting her readiness for such a high-stakes role.

The "60 Minutes" interview served as a catalyst, bringing to light the growing unease among Democrat donors and party members about Harris’s potential to lead the nation if the need arises. The Vice President’s performance during the interview, marked by her signature laughter at inappropriate times and inability to address the questions head-on, did little to assuage the concerns.

Her track record speaks volumes, polling at less than 1% in the Democratic primary, yet she was chosen as Biden’s running mate. Critics argue this decision was based more on checking diversity boxes than on her actual merit or capabilities, a move that may have seemed beneficial at the time but is now coming back to haunt the Democratic Party.

The possibility of California Governor Gavin Newsom stepping up as a 2024 contender adds another layer of complexity to the situation. While some may see him as a fresh alternative, his leadership in California has been far from exemplary, with the state facing a multitude of issues, from homelessness to mismanagement of resources. The American people are wary of importing California’s failed policies to the rest of the country, and Newsom’s association with these failures makes him a less-than-ideal candidate for the Democrats.

As the 2024 elections draw nearer, the Democratic Party finds itself at a crossroads. Acknowledging the elephant in the room – Vice President Harris’s inadequacies – is a step in the right direction, but it also raises the question: who is the right person to lead the Democrats and potentially the country? The conservatives have been saying it all along, and now, it seems, the Democrats are starting to listen.
