The race for the House Speaker position gets even hotter as Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., proclaims, "I'm in." Johnson, a key figure in both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Republican Conference, officially declared his intentions this past Saturday.

In a letter addressed to his GOP colleagues, Johnson emphasized the need for "principled leadership." He stated he hadn't initially dreamt of the Speaker's role, but the urging of numerous members inspired him to step up. Johnson's letter conveyed the urgency of this moment, "It is incumbent upon us now to decide upon a consensus candidate who can serve as a trusted caretaker and a good steward of the gavel."

Renowned as a socially and fiscally conservative constitutional law attorney, Johnson has been a part of the House since 2017. He also took on the role of chairing the Republican Study Committee, which is the House's largest panel. His vision for himself? A "team player and a bridge-builder."

This announcement comes amidst the backdrop of a vacant speakership, following Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, bowing out after his third unsuccessful attempt.

But Johnson is far from the only hopeful. Other contenders include:

- **Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla.** – Currently chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee.
- **Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga.**
- **Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas** – Holds the title of House Rules Committee chair.
- **Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich.** – Retired Marine Corps lieutenant general.
- **Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn.** – The third-ranking Republican in the House, also renowned as a former ice hockey coach. Emmer's mission? "To bring our conference together and get back to work."
- **Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.** – Member of the stringent House Freedom Caucus.
- **Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.** – Currently the minority leader and has received unwavering support from Democrats since the GOP seized the majority.

There's also speculation about potential entrants to the race, such as Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., and Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas.

However, some notable figures like Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have decided against the pursuit after being unable to secure the necessary votes.

With the line-up brimming with potential, it remains to be seen who will clinch the esteemed position. As the race intensifies, America watches closely.
