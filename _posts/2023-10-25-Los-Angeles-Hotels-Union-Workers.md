Hotels situated in the sanctuary confines of Los Angeles County, California, stand accused of substituting their unionized workforce — presently on strike — with newly arrived border crossers and undocumented immigrants. This severe allegation has caught the attention of legal authorities, prompting the District Attorney’s Office to initiate an official investigation.

The hospitality industry of Los Angeles finds itself in turmoil as hotel workers, represented by Unite Here Local 11, allege their employers of engaging in the unethical practice of replacing them with fresh border arrivals and illegal aliens. These replacements are reportedly sourced mainly from Venezuela and Colombia, having entered the United States via the southern border.

The crux of the controversy lies with the hotels allegedly targeting individuals residing in Skid Row, a notorious area of Los Angeles. Hotels are accused of exploiting these newly arrived individuals, offering them low-wage employment opportunities as an alternative to the striking unionized workers.

News reports indicate that since the commencement of intermittent strikes in early July, involving more than 15,000 workers across approximately 60 Southern California hotels, employers have resorted to filling the labor void with a mix of managers, temporary workers, and those recruited via staffing agencies, digital platforms like Instawork, and other means. Specific hotels named in these allegations include the Four Points by Sheraton, Holiday Inn LAX, and Le Meridien Delfina Santa Monica.

Hannah Peterson, an organizer with Unite Here Local 11, highlighted that some of the individuals hired at the Le Meridien Delfina were part of the migrant groups transported to L.A. on buses by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. This act, deemed a political stunt, was aimed at spotlighting the challenges sanctuary cities face and criticizing immigration policies.

With the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office now actively investigating these serious claims, those who have information or have been affected are urged to come forward. District Attorney George Gascon expressed his commitment to addressing these allegations, stating, “We take these egregious allegations with the utmost seriousness. The mistreatment of vulnerable workers and their exploitation will not be tolerated.”

As the nation’s largest sanctuary state, California currently hosts nearly five million illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges intertwined with immigration, labor rights, and ethical employment practices, bringing them to the forefront of public and legal discourse.
