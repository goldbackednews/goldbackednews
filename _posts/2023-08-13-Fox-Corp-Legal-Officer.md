NEW YORK – As of December 31, Fox Corp. will see the departure of its Chief Legal and Policy Officer, Viet Dinh. The resignation comes in the aftermath of a significant $787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, where defamation allegations took center stage.

Although the company has made it clear that Dinh will stay on board as a "special advisor," the motives behind his resignation remain undisclosed. The company's brief statement did little to elucidate the reasons behind the shift. When probed for further insight, Brian Nick, Fox's spokesperson, maintained that the statement said it all.

The case, which has been a considerable talking point over recent months, revolved around accusations that Fox News, a subsidiary of Fox Corp., had circulated false claims regarding the 2020 U.S. presidential election. A series of pretrial disclosures brought to light that, despite internal awareness about the falsehoods of these claims, the network continued to broadcast them.

The reasons? Records that emerged during the lawsuit indicated that the erroneous broadcast was an attempt to win back a demographic of viewers. This segment had begun distancing from the network, especially after Fox News accurately reported Arizona's preference for Democrat Joe Biden during the tumultuous election night. A vice president from Fox Corp. labeled these unfounded election claims as “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”

The lawsuit's revelations were not limited to these disclosures. During a deposition, the Chairman of Fox, Rupert Murdoch, went on record stating his belief in the fairness of the 2020 elections. He further clarified that the claims about the elections being "stolen" from the former President, Donald Trump, were baseless in his view.
