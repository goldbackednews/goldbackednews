**The Controversial 'Rust' Shooting Revisited**

It's been a turbulent journey since the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" in October 2021, which took the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The event has led to a series of legal battles, trying to seek justice for Hutchins. Now, a new report could potentially reopen the case against actor Alec Baldwin.

**Back in the Spotlight**

Despite Baldwin's earlier charges of involuntary manslaughter being dropped in April, new evidence has emerged, prompting a re-evaluation of the incident. Independent forensic firearm experts, Lucien Haag and Mike Haag, commissioned by the prosecution, have revealed findings that seem to contradict Baldwin's assertions.

The report, recently acquired by Fox News Digital, stated, "Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver." It went on to explain that the tragic incident resulted from the hammer being manually pulled back fully and at some point, the trigger being pulled or pressed rearward.

**The Charges Dilemma**

Special prosecutors had dismissed the charges against Baldwin in April due to potential malfunctioning of the revolver. However, they indicated the possibility of refiling the charges if the gun was found unmodified. Current documents reveal, "If it is determined that the gun did not malfunction, charges against Mr. Baldwin will proceed." As of now, new charges against Baldwin are under consideration, although a conclusive decision is yet to be made.

But does this report suffice to recharge Baldwin? Miguel Custodio, a personal injury lawyer, believes otherwise. He opines that this report might bolster the prosecution's case but highlights issues related to evidence tampering. He said, "It's easy for Alec Baldwin’s defense to say ‘The gun didn’t work properly to begin with and the FBI damaged it. Putting it back together again doesn’t prove anything.’"

Interestingly, the FBI’s forensics analysis from August 2022 aligns with the special prosecutors' experts. They found that the gun used in Hutchins' shooting "could not be made to fire without a pull of the trigger."

**Baldwin's Firm Stance**

Baldwin has consistently denied pulling the trigger throughout. In a television appearance in December 2021, Baldwin described the fateful moment, saying, "I let go of the hammer of the gun," and further emphasizing, "The gun goes off."

As the case develops, Baldwin and Hutchins were rehearsing a scene where the actor was to draw the gun and point it at the camera. Baldwin clarified, "The gun wasn't meant to be fired in that angle," and asserted, "I didn't pull the trigger."

As the world watches, the quest for clarity and justice in the tragic shooting on the set of "Rust" continues.
