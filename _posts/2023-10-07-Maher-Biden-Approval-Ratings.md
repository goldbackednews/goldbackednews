Television host Bill Maher of HBO's "Real Time" recently weighed in on President Joe Biden's waning approval ratings. Maher attributed this decline to the stark visual of homelessness and the rise in theft cases, such as the need for store items like hair scrunchies to be locked up.

"It just doesn’t feel good when you see tents everywhere on the street," remarked Maher, highlighting the increasing visibility of homelessness as a factor in the public's perception of the nation's wellbeing. The sentiment was strong: witnessing homelessness at such a scale gives a sense that "the country's [not] right."

Furthering his argument on the atmosphere of insecurity, Maher commented on the stringent security measures some stores have been forced to adopt due to theft. He voiced his own displeasure, "It just doesn’t feel good when I’ve got to get a sales associate to unlock the hair scrunchies."

The talk show host's comments reflect a broader debate surrounding law enforcement, crime rates, and societal compassion. Maher raised the question of balance, pondering the difficulty in finding a "middle ground" between liberal cities downplaying certain crimes and the aggressive approach of figures like former President Donald Trump, who once mentioned "shooting shoplifters."

Sarah Isgur, ABC News Contributor and The Dispatch Editor, joined the discussion, criticizing what she termed as "luxury beliefs" held by those untouched by the direct consequences of crime. According to Isgur, such views masquerade as compassion but may indirectly promote harmful practices, such as drug cartels profiting from human smuggling or being nonchalant about rampant drug use on streets. "It’s not compassionate to tell someone that they should die on the sidewalk," she pointed out.

Maher concurred, drawing attention to the psychological toll such issues can have on individuals. He reiterated that these real-world situations and their direct impact on the lives of Americans might be the underlying reason for the disapproval sentiments against Biden. In his words, "Biden’s always saying, why don’t people like me more? And then they cite numbers."

This candid exchange on Maher's show brings to the forefront issues that many Americans face daily. The conversation underscores the importance of addressing pressing societal challenges, like homelessness and theft, that may significantly influence political approval ratings and public sentiment.
