Have you ever wondered about the actual places where iconic biblical figures like Jesus and Abraham trod? The upcoming film, "Route 60: The Biblical Highway", is set to take audiences on a captivating tour of these ancient landmarks.

## "Route 60" - Bridging The Past And The Present

The film showcases a 150-mile stretch in Israel, from Nazareth in the north to Beersheba in the south, commonly referred to as Route 60. This is the same path that figures such as Abraham and Jesus are believed to have walked.

The journey is guided by former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and David Friedman, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel. With Pompeo's Christian background and Friedman's Jewish heritage, viewers will get dual perspectives on the rich history embedded in this sacred land.

## Insights and Reflections

Throughout the movie, Friedman emphasizes the significance of Route 60, calling it "the road that Abraham, the father of nations, walked" and highlighting its centrality to Christian beliefs due to its association with Jesus.

The film doesn't just focus on the spiritual; it draws parallels between biblical history and modern American politics. Moreover, with both guides having served under the Trump administration, there's also a recounting of some key Middle East diplomatic milestones, including the landmark Abraham Accords.

## Landmarks and Discoveries

Viewers will be transported to the City of David in Jerusalem, where Jesus is believed to have healed a blind man. The team also visits Rachel’s tomb near Bethlehem, shedding light on its significance in Jewish traditions. 

A notable mention is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, venerated as the burial place of Jesus Christ. Pompeo, familiar with Christian history, introduces audiences to the Garden of Gethsemane, the place Jesus visited after the Last Supper and where he was later arrested.

## Contemporary Resonance

Besides the historical and spiritual journey, the film touches upon present-day conflicts. Route 60 traverses through Judea and Samaria, areas rich with biblical history but also centers of modern-day disputes between Palestinians and Israelis.

The movie is touted by Friedman as "a very uplifting and spiritually invigorating film" and is sure to resonate with those intrigued by biblical history, as well as those keen on understanding its impact on today's geopolitics.

As "Route 60: The Biblical Highway" gets set to premiere in 1,500 U.S. theaters, audiences across the country await a cinematic experience that promises to bridge ancient tales with contemporary insights.
