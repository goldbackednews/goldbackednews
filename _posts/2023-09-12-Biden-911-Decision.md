In a concerning development that seems to further highlight the tone-deaf approach of the Biden administration, President Joe Biden made the decision to abstain from attending this year's ceremonies dedicated to the harrowing memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This event, deeply etched in the psyche of Americans, deserved the President's presence and acknowledgement.

Senator Ted Cruz, in his candid discussion on "Rob Schmitt Tonight," expressed no surprise at the President's decision. Cruz emphatically stated that this wasn't the first time the administration's actions have come across as out of touch with the sentiments of the American public, especially those directly affected by the attacks.

"It's a mistake. I think the president has an obligation to tell the American people what it was about, to bring them together," Cruz rightly pointed out. This view gains even more significance when one considers the recent news surrounding plea deals involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be a primary architect of the 9/11 attacks. The Pentagon, under the Biden administration, was seemingly inclined towards these plea deals, ostensibly to circumvent the death penalty.

The unsettling nature of these potential plea deals sparked widespread condemnation. Cruz, along with Representative Nicole Malliotakis from New York, sent a clarion call against such decisions. Their voices, echoing the anguish and concerns of millions of Americans, seem to have resonated, with the administration consequently backing down from the proposed plan.

Cruz didn't hold back in highlighting a pattern of concerning decisions: "But when it comes to this administration and foreign policy, they've put politics ahead of everything. This administration doesn't want to talk about 9/11. They want to put 9/11 behind them."

Making matters worse is the perceived connection between these questionable decisions and the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. The move was hurriedly executed, seemingly to align with the 9/11 anniversary, notwithstanding serious apprehensions from officials.

It's clear that the Biden administration needs to reevaluate its approach, ensuring that the emotions and sentiments of the American populace aren't treated as mere afterthoughts.
