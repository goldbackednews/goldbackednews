As days go by, the desperation seems to grow for Danelo Cavalcante, a fugitive in Pennsylvania who has been evading authorities for almost two weeks. Pennsylvania police indicate that their net might be closing in, but Cavalcante is pulling out all stops to remain a step ahead.

Cavalcante's escape from Chester County Prison, near Philadelphia, took place on August 31, following his conviction for the murder of his ex-girlfriend in 2021. The 34-year-old's tactics to remain hidden seem to grow more daring with each passing day. Not only did he manage to slip past a heavily guarded police perimeter around Longwood Gardens botanical park, but he also took the audacious step of reaching out to former colleagues.

*The search intensifies as Cavalcante's desperation becomes evident.*

Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police weighed in on the situation. "His actions speak volumes about his desperation," Bivens said. "It seems there wasn't much premeditation in his escape. He's now on the run, possibly without a strong support system, given that he's reaching out to people he hasn't been in touch with for a long time."

A recent encounter provides a glimpse into his current situation. Cavalcante altered his appearance, stole a van from a dairy farm, and drove over 20 miles, reaching out to two of his former co-workers in East Pikeland Township and Phoenixville. His changed look, comprising a clean shave, a colored hoodie, green prison pants, and white shoes, was captured on a doorbell camera.

*Security footage aids law enforcement in tracking Cavalcante's movements.*

In a twist, immigration authorities have detained Eleni Cavalcante, the fugitive's sister. However, she seems less than inclined to assist in tracking her brother down.

Cavalcante's escape has had repercussions for prison staff as well. The guard on duty during Cavalcante's dramatic exit – seen on surveillance footage as he adeptly crab-walked a wall in the prison yard – has been dismissed.

Authorities remain on high alert, given Cavalcante's history. "Given his background, it's only prudent to assume he might be armed and dangerous," Bivens commented.

Back in his native Brazil, Cavalcante is no stranger to the law. He's sought for a "double qualified homicide" over a vehicle repair-related debt that culminated in the death of Válter Júnior Moreira dos Reis in 2017.

While the manhunt intensifies, the central message from the authorities remains clear: aiding Cavalcante in any form could have dire consequences, and the desperate fugitive should be approached with utmost caution.
