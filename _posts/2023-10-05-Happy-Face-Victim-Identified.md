Florida investigators have cracked a long-standing mystery, identifying Suzanne Kjellenberg as the eighth victim of the infamous "Happy Face" serial killer, Keith Jesperson.

Jesperson's reign of terror spanned the 1990s. His moniker, "Happy Face," was derived from the eerie smiley-face signature he left on letters sent to media outlets, where he chillingly detailed his crimes. These heinous acts were committed across various states, while he worked as a long-haul trucker.

In a recent, unexpected interview with Okaloosa authorities at the Oregon State Penitentiary, Jesperson made a shocking confession. He revealed details about meeting Kjellenberg at a truck rest stop, stating she was on her way to Lake Tahoe and seeking a ride. The two journeyed together to Cairo, Georgia, even sharing a meal. Their trip took a dark turn on the return leg to Florida. After an altercation in the driver's lounge of his truck, Jesperson brutally ended Kjellenberg's life, then dumped her body along the interstate.

Jesperson had hinted at this killing previously. After his arrest in 1996, he spoke of murdering a woman named either "Susan" or "Suzette" in August 1994. It wasn't until the Okaloosa Sheriff's Office (OSO) made a formal announcement that Kjellenberg's identity came to light, three decades post the tragic discovery of her remains by an inmate worker crew off Interstate 10.

OSO's relentless pursuit of the truth saw them partnering with Othram, a leading forensic genetic genealogy lab, in 2022. This collaboration aimed to identify the remains found 28 years earlier. After providing samples to Othram in 2023, a genealogical profile, funded by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), delivered the leads that eventually named Suzanne Kjellenberg.

District 1 Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deanna Oleske mentioned the entire process took a mere six weeks. On the back of this breakthrough, authorities officially charged Jesperson with Kjellenberg's murder.

Sheriff Eric Aden expressed his gratitude for the perseverance shown over the years. He stated, "Thanks to the tireless efforts of so many over so long, the remains of Suzanne Kjellenberg, the final unidentified victim of Jesperson’s cross-country murder sprees, can finally leave the Medical Examiner’s Office, and return home."

The harrowing tale of Keith Jesperson and his victims serves as a haunting reminder of the secrets that sometimes lay hidden for decades, only to resurface when least expected.
