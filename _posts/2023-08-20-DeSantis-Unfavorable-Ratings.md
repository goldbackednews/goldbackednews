The political dynamics within the Republican Party seem to be taking a surprising turn. This week's Morning Consult survey indicates that while former President Donald Trump remains the most favored GOP candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has surpassed Trump in unfavorable ratings.

**Trump Holds the Throne**

Despite his ongoing legal challenges, Trump still dominates the GOP primary field. A commanding 76% of the respondents view Trump in a positive light, contrasting with a mere 22% who harbor unfavorable sentiments. His popularity has shown resilience, and it’s noteworthy that Trump's ratings have consistently surged post any indictment announcements.

However, the survey also casts a spotlight on Gov. Ron DeSantis, who, despite having a decent 65% favorable rating, has managed to garner a slightly higher unfavorable rating than Trump, standing at 23%.

**The Field Widens**

It's not just DeSantis and Trump in the spotlight. The survey provides insights into other potential GOP contenders:

- Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, known for his anti-woke stance, secures a 55% favorable rating. Interestingly, 20% claim they haven't heard of him.
  
- Former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's running mate, stands with a 48% favorable rating, despite having the second-highest unfavorable rating at 40%.

- South Carolina leaders, former Governor Nikki Haley and Senator Tim Scott, maintain positive ratings, standing at 45-18 and 47-12, respectively.

- Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie seems to face headwinds as he emerges as the most unfavorable GOP candidate, with a 47% unfavorable rating against a 28% favorable one.

The survey, taken from August 10-13, 2023, encompassed 810 potential GOP primary voters, with a margin of error at +/- 4%.

As the political landscape evolves, especially in light of Trump's recent indictment as part of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's investigation, it remains intriguing to see how these ratings play out in the political arena and shape future strategies.
