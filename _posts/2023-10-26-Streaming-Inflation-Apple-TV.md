Apple has decided to significantly hike the prices of its popular streaming service, Apple TV+. Subscribers are about to feel the pinch in their wallets as the cost of a monthly subscription jumps from $6.99 to $9.99, and yearly subscriptions increase from $69 to $99. This marks a whopping 40% increase, leaving consumers and industry experts alike grappling with the implications of such a steep rise in costs.

Just a year ago, Apple implemented a price increase for its streaming service, raising the monthly subscription cost from $4.99 to $6.99. With this latest increase, the price has effectively doubled in a mere 12 months, sending shockwaves through the streaming entertainment industry. Subscribers can expect these new prices to take effect on their next billing date, leaving many to wonder if the service is worth the escalating cost.

Apple's price hikes come on the heels of similar moves by other major players in the streaming world. Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video have all recently increased their subscription costs, putting additional financial pressure on consumers. However, unlike its competitors, Apple has yet to unveil an ad-supported option, which could potentially offer a more affordable alternative for budget-conscious viewers.

The industry has coined the term “streamflation” to describe the recent trend of rising costs in the streaming entertainment sector. A Wall Street Journal analysis published in August revealed that the average cost of a major ad-free streaming service has surged nearly 25% in a year. Streaming companies are gambling on the willingness of consumers to either shell out more money or switch to less expensive, ad-supported tiers, which tend to be more profitable for the providers.

It's not just Apple TV+ that’s experiencing a price hike; other services under the Apple umbrella are also getting more expensive. Apple Music’s annual plan is seeing a 10% increase, rising to $109 per year. Additionally, Apple Arcade and Apple News+ monthly subscriptions are going up by $2 and $3 respectively, settling at $6.99 and $12.99.

As the streaming entertainment landscape continues to evolve, consumers are left navigating the tricky terrain of rising costs and the quest for value. With no signs of prices plateauing anytime soon, the question on everyone's mind is: How much are we willing to pay for our entertainment, and what are the alternatives? Apple’s bold move has undoubtedly set a precedent, and only time will tell how the market—and the consumers—will respond.
