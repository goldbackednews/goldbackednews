Amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, Mia Khalifa, the once adult film actress turned social media sensation, has made waves with her support for Palestinian fighters during the recent Hamas attacks on Israel. Her opinions, shared with her millions of followers, have sparked significant debate online.

Khalifa, boasting a massive following of 5 million on Twitter and 27.5 million on Instagram, shared a plethora of posts on Saturday expressing her firm stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Referring to one image of the aggressors, she commented that it looked like a “Renaissance painting.” Mia Khalifa's significant reach ensures that her perspectives make a notable impact.

On the subject of the long-standing conflict, Khalifa remarked, “If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid and history will show that in time.” She further expressed disbelief at the idea of the "Zionist apartheid regime" facing challenges from guerrilla fighters, some of whom she humorously noted were donned in "fake Gucci shirts".

Khalifa was not alone in her sentiments. She reposted statements from fellow influencers, such as Kelbin with 130,000 followers, who expressed that the attacks showcased the oppressed fighting their oppressor. Another influencer, Sana Saeed with 110,000 followers, shared her personal experience of receiving applause and support when identifying as Palestinian in Istanbul markets. A sentiment of supporting Palestinians was prevalent among various posts shared by Khalifa.

However, it's essential to note that Mia Khalifa's outspokenness is not solely restricted to political matters. Known for her brief yet impactful stint in the adult film industry, she has been vocal about her regrets concerning her past decisions. In 2020, she joined OnlyFans, where she shares content described as “safe for work, but spicy.” By August 2023, Mia made headlines with a clip promoting "marriage advice," wherein she advocated for women to leave unsatisfactory relationships, emphasizing the non-sanctimonious nature of marriage.

In the vast realm of social media, where opinions are shared and spread at lightning speed, voices like Mia Khalifa's play a pivotal role. Whether one agrees or disagrees with her positions, the influence she wields cannot be denied. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to evolve, it's clear that celebrities and influencers will remain vocal in shaping public opinion.
