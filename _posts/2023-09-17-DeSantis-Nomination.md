Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida recently shared some strong opinions about the upcoming 2024 presidential election. He firmly believes that no candidate should automatically get a nomination. Everyone has to earn their spot.

During a chat on the "America Reports" show on Fox News, DeSantis spoke about his game plan. He believes his campaign is ready to go the distance. Even though his current poll numbers might not be super high, he's still giving it his all. He thinks there are many people in states like Iowa who haven't made up their minds on who to vote for. This means there's still a chance for him to get their support.

The key issues for voters, according to DeSantis, are the economy, border security, crime rates, education, and the role of government. He believes he knows what people care about. The real challenge? Finding out who's the best person to handle all these issues.

DeSantis is super excited about his team in the early voting states. He believes they have what it takes to go all the way. He stated, "A lot of voters haven’t made a firm decision. They may be leaning one way or another. So, I think this is very fluid, and I think someone’s got to go out there and grab it."

His main point? Nobody should expect to be handed the nomination on a silver platter. They need to show up, work hard, and earn every single vote. And that's exactly what DeSantis plans to do.
