In a recent maneuver that has left many scratching their heads, President Joe Biden has unabashedly opened the floodgates for more white-collar migration into the United States, specifically targeting the jobs that our own debt-ridden graduates so desperately need. This bold move has been neatly packaged in the “Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,” a directive that on the surface promises innovation and progress but delves deeper into a sea of questionable decisions.

For those unacquainted with the notorious H-1B visa program, it is a gateway for approximately 200,000 foreign graduates annually, promising them a slice of the American Dream. However, critics like Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. TechWorkers, are calling out Biden’s decision, likening it to setting up a new era of indentured servitude. The program is not just a vessel for top-tier talent as it's often portrayed but has become a tool for corporations to displace American workers, holding their foreign employees' futures hostage with the dangling carrot of a green card.

With over 1.5 million visa workers already saturating various sectors of the U.S. job market, the expansion of this program only stands to exacerbate the issue. The Biden administration, backed by Fortune 500 lobbyists and investors, is pushing this agenda forward, indifferent to the potential career derailment for skilled American graduates. Employers are quick to cash in on this opportunity, leaving American workers in the dust.

Divyansh Kaushik, an imported Indian immigrant and representative of a white-collar employers lobby group, has already laid out a comprehensive list of ‘benefits’ this executive order brings to the table. From easier visa renewals to fast-tracked green cards for favored foreigners, it's a shopping list designed to serve employers, not employees. This, while native STEM graduates are left grappling with a saturated job market, as highlighted by a 2021 Census Bureau report.

What’s most troubling is the sheer volume of technically skilled American graduates being flushed out of their careers, especially as they age. The displacement does not just impact individual careers but has far-reaching implications on national competitiveness and innovation. While Biden’s directive promises growth and leadership in innovation, it simultaneously undermines the very workforce capable of driving that progress.

Critics argue that the issue at hand is not migration itself, but the insatiable hunger of Wall Street for short-term profits, a hunger that seems to be dictating policy decisions. The Biden administration’s plan, veiled as a step towards innovation, is a dangerous dance with economic instability, sidelining American workers in favor of short-term corporate gains.

As we navigate through this sea of contradictions and questionable policy decisions, one thing is clear: the American worker deserves better. The Biden administration’s directive is a stark reminder of the urgent need for policies that prioritize the American workforce, ensuring a future where innovation and progress are driven by the very people who call this nation home.
