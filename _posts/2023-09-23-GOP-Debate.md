The Republican National Committee (RNC) is raising the stakes for presidential candidates, enforcing stricter qualifying criteria for the third debate in November. This decision intensifies the competitive atmosphere surrounding the GOP’s presidential nomination debates, as candidates must now meet higher polling and donor thresholds to make it to the stage.

## Stricter Criteria for Candidates
Candidates aiming to participate in the third debate must secure a minimum of 70,000 unique donors, along with 200 donors from at least 20 states, to their campaign or exploratory committee. The decision on these thresholds was taken during a debate committee conference call and is seen as a notable escalation from the previous debates.

In addition to donor support, candidates must also garner 4% support in two national polls or achieve 4% in one national and two statewide polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, or South Carolina, which are the first four states in the Republican presidential nominating calendar.

## The Evolving Debate Landscape
The qualifying thresholds have been steadily rising with each debate. The first debate, hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee, required candidates to attain 1% in the polls and secure 40,000 donors, allowing eight contenders to face off. For the upcoming second debate, which is set at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California, the criteria were raised to 3% in the polls and 50,000 donors.

Six out of the eight candidates from the first debate have already met the RNC’s heightened criteria for the second debate, including prominent figures like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and former Vice President Mike Pence.

## Allegiance to the Party
Apart from meeting donor and polling thresholds, candidates must also sign a pledge committing their support to the eventual Republican presidential nominee. This agreement prohibits candidates from participating in non-RNC sanctioned debates for the remainder of the 2024 election cycle and mandates data-sharing with the national party committee.

## Former President’s Stand
Interestingly, former President Donald Trump, who met the donor and polling criteria, chose not to sign the RNC’s pledge, citing his significant lead over other candidates. Consequently, he did not attend the first debate and has already arranged alternative plans for the next showdown.

## Impact on the Race
The imposition of these stringent norms signifies the RNC’s attempt to streamline the nomination process and ensure that only the most competitive and supported candidates make it to the debate stage. This move is likely to bring forth more focused and substantive discussions, allowing voters to make informed decisions in the run-up to the 2024 Presidential Election. Whether this elevated bar will serve to clarify or complicate the field remains a point of intrigue as the debates unfold.
