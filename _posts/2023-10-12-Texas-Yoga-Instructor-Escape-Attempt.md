Kaitlin Armstrong, an Austin, Texas yoga instructor, made headlines after being accused of the dramatic love-triangle murder of professional cyclist Anna Moriah "Mo" Wilson. But her story took yet another twist as she allegedly tried to escape custody during a medical appointment.

Armstrong had previously captivated the media when she fled the U.S. during the early stages of the investigation into Wilson's death, only to be apprehended after a 43-day manhunt on a Costa Rican beach. Despite the dramatic circumstances surrounding her capture, authorities did not anticipate what was to come next.

According to the Travis County Sheriff's Office (TCSO) spokesperson, Drew Knight, Armstrong tried to seize an opportunity to escape as she and two correction officers were leaving a medical facility. Thanks to her high school track and field background, Armstrong led officers on a 10-minute foot chase. However, her efforts were in vain, and she was quickly recaptured.

It's essential to delve into the backstory to grasp the significance of this latest escape attempt. Armstrong stands accused of the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Mo Wilson. Wilson, after a night out with Armstrong's live-in boyfriend, professional cyclist Colin Strickland, returned to a friend's apartment. She was found hours later in a bathroom, lifeless, in a pool of her blood. This tragic event unraveled the tangled love-triangle narrative, with Armstrong allegedly seeing Wilson as a romantic rival.

Armstrong's boyfriend, Strickland, however, defended her in interviews with detectives. He repeatedly vouched for her character, stating he could not believe she would be capable of such violence. Despite these assertions, surveillance footage and evidence, including a handgun from Armstrong's residence that matched shell casings from the crime scene, pointed toward her involvement.

Notably, Armstrong was questioned by the Austin Police on May 12, a day after the tragic event. But she was told she wasn't under arrest and was released. Taking advantage of this freedom, Armstrong fled to New York and then jetted internationally from New Jersey.

The Costa Rican authorities, after her capture, extradited her back to the U.S. due to an immigration violation. She has since been held at the Travis County Jail in Austin on a hefty $3.5 million bail.

In the midst of this ongoing saga, Armstrong's defense has actively disputed the prosecution's depiction of her seeing Wilson as a "romantic rival," dismissing the notion as "misogynistic and fictitious."

As this case unfolds, it's evident that the story of Kaitlin Armstrong and Mo Wilson is not just another crime narrative but a saga filled with intrigue, emotion, and unexpected turns.
