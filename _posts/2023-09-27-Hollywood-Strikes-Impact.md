The dual strikes by Hollywood writers and actors have reportedly had a significant impact on Democratic fundraising, including on President Joe Biden's 2024 re-election campaign. Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden's re-election bid under financial strain. 

### A Blow to Campaign Projections

Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden's campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position.

### Waiting on Biden's Blessing

Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part.

### Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes

The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers' strike as early as October. However, actors remain steadfast, continuing their strike and resulting in a dearth of celebrity fundraising events, leaving the Democrats to face the financial music.

### Will Hollywood Stars Lend Their Support Again?

Hollywood’s support was instrumental in the Biden-Harris ticket success in 2020. Celebrities threw millions at the candidates, painting the town blue. However, with Biden’s popularity plummeting amidst rising inflation and an escalating crisis at the border, Hollywood's loyalty and financial support appear shaky at best. With the current situation labeled as toxic, the speculation is whether Hollywood stars will publicly support Biden's campaign again.

### Prolonged Aftermath

The strikes continue to pose extensive repercussions for Democrats. As one Southern California Democratic strategist mentions, it was a "massive earthquake with prolonged aftershocks expected for months still." Biden and the Democrats seem to be caught in a tempest with dwindling support from a crucial sector, raising the question of whether they can navigate through these turbulent times successfully. 

### Final Thoughts

In the game of politics where financial backing can sometimes dictate the sway of power, the impact of the Hollywood strikes on Democratic coffers is evident. This situation does not only illustrate the importance of Hollywood’s support in American politics but also raises questions about Biden's ability to manage crises and his relevance in the current political landscape.
