The Republican National Committee (RNC) is all geared up for the first major face-off of the 2024 election cycle. With the announcement of eight notable candidates taking the stage in Milwaukee, the GOP's inaugural debate promises to be an intense and enlightening battle of ideas and agendas.

**RNC’s Stringent Criteria**

Aiming to ensure a robust representation, the RNC set forth stringent conditions for the candidates' participation. They had to attain at least 1% in three national polls or hit the mark in two national and two state-specific polls from early voting states. Beyond just the polling numbers, an impressive list of 40,000 unique donors, spread across 20+ states and territories, was also a requisite.

>The stage wasn't just about popularity and funding. The candidates' commitment to the party was put to the test as they were required to pledge allegiance to the eventual GOP nominee and refrain from participating in non-RNC-endorsed debates for the entire 2024 cycle.

**The Esteemed Line-Up**

The participants, as confirmed by the RNC, span a range of experiences and backgrounds:

- North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum
- Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
- Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley
- Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson
- Former Vice President Mike Pence
- Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina
- Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy

This diverse lineup promises a comprehensive discussion on pressing issues, offering voters a clear insight into where each candidate stands.

**A Notable Absence**

Despite meeting the RNC’s criteria, former President Donald Trump chose not to sign the pledge and will therefore be conspicuously absent from the debate stage. This has sparked discussions about the former President's strategy for the 2024 elections and his relationship with the Republican party.

**Tune In For The Showdown**

Set to air on Fox News, with Rumble as the online streaming partner, the debate is grabbing national attention. Partnered with Young America’s Foundation, it's sure to be a pivotal moment in the lead-up to the 2024 elections.

As the nation tunes in, the Milwaukee showdown will undeniably shape the narrative of the GOP primaries and offer a glimpse into the future of the Republican party.
