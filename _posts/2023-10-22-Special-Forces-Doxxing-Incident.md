In an alarming incident this week, the White House admitted to accidentally revealing the identities of American Special Forces in Israel during President Joe Biden’s visit. The blunder occurred when a photo, featuring the President with the Special Forces, was posted on the White House’s Instagram account, which boasts a following of 7.6 million. The photo inadvertently exposed the faces of these highly confidential operatives, placing their safety, as well as that of their families, in jeopardy.

The White House's failure to blur or conceal the identities of the Special Forces has drawn widespread criticism and concern. Visible in the photo were also unique identifiers such as tattoos, further jeopardizing the anonymity of the personnel. The caption of the now-removed photo read, "In Israel, President Biden met with first responders to thank them for their bravery and the work they’re doing in response to the Hamas terrorist attacks."

After retired Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Samuel Shoemate brought this severe oversight to public attention, and after the photo had already reached hundreds of thousands of viewers, the White House acted swiftly to remove the image and issued an apology. “As soon as this was brought to our attention, we immediately deleted the photo. We regret the error and any issues this may have caused,” the White House stated.

However, accountability for this blunder remains unclear, as the White House has not disclosed who was responsible for the error. When the Pentagon was approached for comments, they redirected inquiries back to the White House. “I’d have to refer you to the White House on that. I just don’t have any information to provide,” was the response from Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder during a press conference.

This incident raises questions about the integrity of Biden's promise to never use troops for political purposes, a pledge he made during his first visit to the Pentagon as President, stating, “I will never dishonor you. I will never disrespect you. I will never politicize the work you do.” This promise seems to be contradicted by his actions, as this is not the first instance where Biden has utilized troops as political props. In September 2022, Biden delivered a highly charged political speech, positioning two Marine sentries directly behind him, drawing sharp criticism from various quarters including Republican officials, conservative commentators, Marine veterans, military spouses, and even corporate news journalists.

This latest incident, therefore, not only jeopardizes the safety of the exposed Special Forces but also brings to light the ongoing issue of the politicization of the military, a matter that requires immediate attention and rectification.
