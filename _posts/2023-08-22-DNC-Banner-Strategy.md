In a bold move aimed at the Republican base, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is set to display its feelings towards the "Make America Great Again" movement in the sky during the upcoming GOP debate.

**Message in the Sky**

Tomorrow, as the GOP gathers for its first primary debate of the 2024 race in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the DNC plans to make its presence felt. A plane, sponsored by the DNC, will be seen hovering over the Fiserv Forum, proudly displaying a banner reading "GOP 2024: A Race for the Extreme MAGA Base."

According to reports, this high-flying act is just a fraction of the DNC's larger media campaign associated with the debate. On the ground, three billboards will be strategically placed around the venue, alongside a mobile billboard truck, all sharply criticizing the GOP's track record.

**Counter-narrative Set by DNC**

While the GOP candidates gear up for the debate, the DNC isn't planning to remain silent. DNC Chair Jamie Harrison is preparing for a press conference intended to counteract the GOP's narratives, and the committee is also establishing a robust "war room" to generate prompt Democratic responses to the topics discussed during the event.

**Absentees and Contenders**

Interestingly, former President Donald Trump, the mastermind behind the "Make America Great Again" catchphrase, has chosen to skip the debate. Instead, he's slated to partake in an online chat with ex-Fox News anchor, Tucker Carlson, simultaneously.

As the debate stage readies itself, eight GOP candidates have made the cut, meeting the RNC's stringent participation criteria. These include high-profile names such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, among others. A few hopefuls, including media figure Larry Elder, are challenging the RNC's decision to leave them out, contending they've met all requisite benchmarks.

**The Polling Landscape**

Though not participating, Trump continues to be a significant figure in the polls. According to FiveThirtyEight, he leads with a staggering 52.2%, dwarfing the second-placed DeSantis who sits at 14.5%. The race continues with Ramaswamy at 8.9%, Pence at 4.2%, and the rest trailing below.

As the political landscape heats up with the approach of the 2024 elections, both parties are pulling no punches. With the DNC's decision to visually fly its disdain for the GOP, it's clear that the run-up to the elections will be nothing short of dramatic.
