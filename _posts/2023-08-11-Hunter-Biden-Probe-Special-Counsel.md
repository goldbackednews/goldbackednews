Attorney General Merrick Garland has designated David Weiss, U.S. prosecutor, as the special counsel in the ongoing inquiry into Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden. The Department of Justice (DOJ) made the announcement this Friday, clarifying that Weiss will spearhead not just the current investigation but any subsequent inquiries that may arise in relation to it.

Previously, Weiss, who has been directing the Hunter Biden investigation, did not possess special counsel status. This status change came after Weiss requested for the appointment, and Garland deemed it beneficial for public interest, he stated. This move intends to maintain a perceived impartiality between the Biden administration and the investigation.

However, the decision hasn't come without its critics. Russell Dye, speaking on behalf of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), lambasted the decision to the press. "David Weiss can't be relied upon, and this appointment appears as an effort to brush under the rug the alleged Biden family misdeeds," he remarked. Dye further criticized Weiss for previously advocating for a lenient plea deal that was subsequently declined by a federal judge. 

The skepticism wasn't confined to Dye alone. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) viewed the appointment with suspicion, suggesting a potential concealment attempt by the DOJ. Comer tweeted, highlighting the possible involvement of President Biden in profiteering schemes related to the Biden "brand".

The DOJ's probe into Hunter Biden takes another twist with news of Hunter facing potential gun and tax charges, which might see a trial in California or Washington, DC. Previously, Hunter had consented to a guilty plea over misdemeanor charges linked to income tax evasion. Yet, a snag regarding a separate gun charge led to a collapse in the agreement. Consequently, Hunter entered a not-guilty plea.

Prosecutors maintained that, despite the defense team's presumptions, other investigations surrounding Hunter were ongoing. And with the deepening inquiry, it raises the question if President Joe Biden might be implicated, as one jury member was reportedly asked to pinpoint the "big guy."
