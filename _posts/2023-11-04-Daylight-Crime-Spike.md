As Americans turn their clocks back this fall, they might get an extra hour of sleep but at a high cost – their safety. A recent study highlights a sharp increase in criminal activity coinciding with the end of daylight saving time (DST), shining a spotlight on a seasonal change that could have a darker side.

Based on FBI data analyzed by smart home company Vivint from 2017 to 2021, there's not just an uptick in the percentage of crimes after daylight saving ends, but also a total climb in crime rates. With the extra hour of evening darkness, incidents such as robberies and vehicle thefts have surged dramatically. These alarming statistics may lead to urgent calls for extended daylight hours and improved home security measures.

Robberies have seen an 81% jump, while the likelihood of vehicle thefts has revved up by 61% post-DST. Vivint points out that well-protected homes with security systems tend to fend off burglars more effectively, suggesting a push for better home security could be a response to this crime wave.

Previous studies, like those from the Brookings Institution and the Journal of Experimental Criminology, back up these findings, indicating that continuous daylight saving could keep crime rates in check. The evidence suggests that the cover of darkness is a blanket under which many criminals find comfort.

Former NYPD sergeant and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Joseph Giacalone, reinforces this idea, noting that the increased darkness in the mornings post-DST also offers opportunities for crime as people head to work or school.

This spike in crime has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers. With many Americans disenchanted with the annual fall back, the Senate has already passed the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving permanent, a bill still pending in the House. Senator Marco Rubio, the bill’s chief proponent, has strongly criticized the biannual clock change as outdated and detrimental, advocating for a year-round daylight saving to improve public safety and health, boost the economy, and assist farmers.

The implications of this study are clear: the current practice of switching the clocks may be doing more harm than good, leaving Americans vulnerable during darker evenings. Until there's a change in policy, the recommendation is to light up homes, lock up tight, and stay vigilant as the days shorten.

So as we set our clocks back at 2 a.m. this Sunday, it's not just about adjusting our alarms – it's about bracing for a season that statistically brings more than just winter chills, but heightened risks on our streets as well.
