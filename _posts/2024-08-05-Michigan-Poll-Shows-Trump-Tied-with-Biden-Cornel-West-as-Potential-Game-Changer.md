A recent Michigan poll exploring a hypothetical 2024 presidential race has shown that former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden are neck and neck, with the potential inclusion of Cornel West as a third-party candidate swinging the lead in favor of Trump.

The survey conducted by Trafalgar Group indicates a closely fought contest in the battleground state, with Trump and Biden each holding a significant chunk of voter preference. However, the dynamic changes dramatically with the introduction of Cornel West, a noted progressive intellectual and critic of both Trump and Biden, as a third-party candidate.

When respondents were asked to choose among the three, West's presence resulted in Trump leading Biden by a few percentage points. This suggests that West's entry could siphon off votes primarily from Biden, shaking up what would otherwise be a closely contested race.

The results underscore the potentially influential role third-party candidates can play in the political landscape, particularly in tightly contested swing states like Michigan.

While it's still early days in the run-up to 2024, this poll provides an intriguing snapshot of how the electoral dynamics could shift with the involvement of high-profile third-party candidates.
