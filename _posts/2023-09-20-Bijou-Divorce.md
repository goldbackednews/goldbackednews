In a turn of events that's captured the attention of Hollywood and fans worldwide, Bijou Phillips, model and actress, has filed for divorce from her husband, actor Danny Masterson, best known for his role in the popular sitcom "That '70s Show."

## A Marriage Under the Spotlight

Phillips, 43, has cited "irreconcilable differences" in her official court documents. The couple, who got married in 2011, shares a daughter. Phillips' petition notably seeks full legal and physical custody of their child, proposing visitation rights for Masterson.

While many knew them as a vibrant pair, especially after seeing them in matching outfits at various events, the shadows of recent events loomed large over their relationship. Just two weeks ago, Masterson, 47, received a sentence of 30 years to life in prison on two counts of forcible rape.

## The Trials and Emotional Rollercoaster

The charges and subsequent conviction shook Hollywood. Masterson was on trial twice, with the first ending in a mistrial last November. He had faced accusations related to events occurring between 2001 and 2003 at his Hollywood Hills residence. 

Throughout the legal ordeals, Phillips remained a steadfast presence, supporting her husband in court. Sketches from the courtroom even captured a poignant moment where Masterson blew a kiss to his wife after his sentencing.

This unwavering support might be why the news of their divorce has come as a surprise to many. Just last week, sources claimed Phillips had "no plans" to leave Masterson, even expressing her heartbreak and urging the court to consider his pivotal role in their family.

## A Look Back at Their Journey

The duo first crossed paths at a celebrity poker game in 2004. Their connection was instantaneous, leading to a 19-year journey together filled with ups and downs. They celebrated their union in 2011 and welcomed their daughter in 2014. Phillips once wrote about their bond, saying, "Danny and I have been together for 19 years... I can say that Danny has literally been a life-saving partner to me."

Masterson's legal team has already signaled plans to appeal the court's decision, citing alleged mistakes during the trial. On a related note, when the Church of Scientology was asked for a comment on Masterson's case, they reaffirmed their policy urging members to adhere to the laws and denied any accusations of harassment towards the accusers.

As this chapter ends and new ones begin for both Phillips and Masterson, fans and the entertainment world will be keenly watching and hoping for healing and closure for all involved.
