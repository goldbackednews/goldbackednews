Notorious for his roles in films like "Wargames" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," Matthew Broderick took a moment to shed light on a less glamorous side of his past during a recent podcast. The actor shared a series of disturbing incidents from his childhood in New York City, a world away from the big screens where he usually graces his fans.

While being a guest on iHeart's "Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi" podcast, Broderick painted a vivid picture of his childhood, where he recalled being targeted often in neighborhoods near Washington Square North, the Village, Times Square, and the Upper West Side. "I got mugged often," he stated, recounting incidents that started as young as 12 years old.

The confrontations weren't always benign. Broderick spoke of one particular event when he was skateboarding through Central Park. Without warning, a large gang confronted him, and he remembered, "I got whacked in the head with some sort of stick!" Thankfully, he and his friend managed to escape, albeit with stolen possessions and a scar to remember the day.

But this wasn't an isolated event. The actor shared more unsettling encounters, from bullies demanding lunch money to much graver situations on New York's subway, where strangers would threaten and interrogate him.

Reflecting on the advice he received during those times, Broderick mentioned a school visit by a police officer who guided the kids on handling such situations. "Always bring money with you... immediately give it up and try to make the experience as fast as possible," was the wisdom he received.

Matthew's narrative paints a stark contrast to today's protective environment for children. He recalls that his parents, although informed about the muggings, "werenâ€™t as watchful as we are to our kids."

Away from these somber memories, Matthew Broderick has built a successful career and a loving family. Married to the iconic "Sex and the City" actress Sarah Jessica Parker for over two and a half decades, the couple is parents to three children - James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters, Tabitha and Marion, 13.
