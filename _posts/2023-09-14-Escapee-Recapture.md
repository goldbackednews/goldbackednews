Pennsylvania's Chester County, located approximately 30 miles from Philadelphia, was the epicenter of a two-week-long suspenseful manhunt. The fugitive in question? Danelo Cavalcante, a 34-year-old convicted murderer who managed a Hollywood-esque escape from the local prison.

On August 31st, the audacious escape of Cavalcante was caught on camera, showing him crab-walking up a wall to freedom from the Chester County Prison. He was awaiting a transfer to state prison when he made his daring getaway. This set off a massive manhunt, with authorities using every tool at their disposal - mounted units, SWAT teams, and state and local police - scouring the farmlands and woodlands of the county.

Cavalcante, originally from Brazil, was no stranger to crime. Convicted for the 2021 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, he is also a prime suspect in another homicide from 2017 back in Brazil. His escape had residents on high alert as reports of home break-ins began to surface. Cavalcante stole supplies, altered his appearance, and in one harrowing instance, exchanged gunfire with a homeowner.

Images captured six hours post his arrest show a disheveled Cavalcante, barefoot in a hospital robe, displaying the aftermath of his capture. A K-9 bite wound, courtesy of his attempt to escape the arresting officers, had required medical treatment.

Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police described the arrest, emphasizing the element of surprise. "They were able to move in very quietly," he reported. Cavalcante, seemingly unaware, was cornered with stolen goods and a rifle.

The community can now breathe a sigh of relief. This man, who once crawled his way to freedom and evoked widespread panic, is now back behind bars, awaiting a life sentence for his crimes.
