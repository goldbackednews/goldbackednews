In a recent turn of events, renowned actors and couple, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, have publicly retracted their previous endorsement for their former "That ’70s Show" co-star, Danny Masterson, after his conviction for rape.

**Apology Through the Lens of Social Media**

A video uploaded to Instagram witnessed both Kutcher and Kunis expressing their remorse. The pair clarified that their intention was solely to support a friend they had known for 25 years, without any thought of causing harm.

“Being aware of the pain the character letters have inflicted, we sincerely apologize,” Kutcher voiced.

Reiterating their commitment to supporting victims of abuse, Kunis added, “Our past endeavors prove our dedication to supporting victims. This will continue to be a focus for us.”

The letters were composed in response to a plea from Masterson's family, hoping their influence would have a bearing on the sentencing phase. Masterson was ultimately sentenced to 30 years to life for the rape of two women.

Kunis emphasized that the letters were never meant to question the judicial system's legitimacy or cast doubt on the jury's decision.

Both actors expressed deep sorrow for any harm their actions may have inadvertently caused, especially if it led to the re-traumatization of victims. “We deeply regret the hurt caused and extend our sympathy to every victim of sexual assault, abuse, or rape,” the couple concluded.

**A Polarizing Figure Amongst Co-stars**

Breitbart News highlighted that Kutcher and Kunis's letter to the judge praised Masterson as an “exceptional role model” and a beacon against drug abuse in Hollywood.

Kutcher wrote, “Attributing my distance from the common Hollywood trap of drugs directly to Danny, he has consistently demonstrated exemplary behavior.”

Further, Kunis lauded Masterson's influence, describing him as a guiding light against drug abuse, emphasizing his impact on her well-being and decision-making in the entertainment realm.

However, not all co-stars from "That ’70s Show" shared the couple's sentiment. While Kurtwood Smith, Debra Rupp, and David Trainer expressed their support for Masterson, Topher Grace distinctly distanced himself. Grace’s wife, Ashley Hinshaw, posted a potent statement on Instagram, shedding light on the trauma survivors endure in such circumstances, “To every rape victim retraumatized by societal debates over the rapist's fate, we see and recognize your pain,” she articulated.

As the dust settles on this episode, it serves as a poignant reminder of the responsibility public figures carry and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.
