Recent data from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) signals an alarming increase in dangerous encounters between American and Chinese aircraft. The DOD voiced concerns about the "coercive and risky" behaviors demonstrated by Chinese planes in their interactions with U.S. aircraft.

During a press briefing on Tuesday, DOD officials showcased newly declassified images and footage illustrating these precarious situations. Ely Ratner, the Assistant Defense Secretary for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, articulated the gravity of the situation. "From 2021 onward, over 180 incidents involving risky behaviors from People's Liberation Army (PLA) operators have been reported, more than what we saw in the preceding decade," Ratner stated.

These behaviors include aggressive maneuvers, rapid approaches, and even the firing of flares dangerously close to U.S. aircraft. Such actions are perceived as attempts by the PLA to challenge and obstruct U.S. military operations within regions internationally recognized as global commons.

Ratner emphasized that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) doesn't limit its disruptive antics to U.S. aircraft. When factoring in similar confrontations against aircraft belonging to U.S. allies and partners, the number jumps to almost 300 incidents in the same timeframe. Such statistics underline a broader trend of hostility and provocation in east Asian territories.

Images released by the DOD paint a concerning picture of these interactions. One particularly distressing image displays a PLA fighter jet, mere feet away from a U.S. aircraft, maneuvering in a way that could compromise the safety of both planes. Another document captures a PLA pilot resorting to crude language after being radioed by the U.S. operator.

Admiral John Aquilino, the Indo-Pacom Commander, offered a perspective on these incidents. "While aerial intercepts occur frequently worldwide, they predominantly transpire without mishaps. There's no reason for the interactions in the Indo-Pacific with the PRC to deviate from this norm," he stated. Aquilino highlighted the paramount importance of the safety of U.S. servicemembers, asserting the need to spotlight and mitigate these hazardous behaviors.

Though the DOD has shed light on the rising aerial confrontations, they did not provide a concise delineation between what they termed as "coercive" and "risky" versus more commonly used descriptors like "unsafe" or "unprofessional."

With tensions escalating in the skies, it remains imperative for both nations to find avenues of communication and collaboration, ensuring the safety and security of all involved.
