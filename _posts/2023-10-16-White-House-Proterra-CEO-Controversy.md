Despite the financial turbulence at California's electric bus manufacturer, Proterra, its CEO, Gareth Joyce, remains a steadfast member of President Biden's top advisory council. This ongoing relationship, given Proterra's recent bankruptcy filing, has stirred political discussions and raised eyebrows.

Established to provide counsel on government policies and programs impacting U.S. trade, **the White House Export Council** is where Joyce has been a pivotal member since February. Yet, just months later in August, under his leadership, Proterra chose to file for voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization due to negative financial trends.

In a statement made earlier, Joyce highlighted Proterra's significant contributions towards "decarbonization across the commercial vehicle industry." He also shared the company's struggles with market fluctuations and challenges in scaling their opportunities.

This, however, has not deterred the White House from praising Joyce for his commitment to transitioning transit vehicles towards zero-emission solutions. But, such commendation hasn't been without backlash. Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee Ranking Member, John Barrasso, R-Wyo., vocally criticized Joyce's ongoing advisory role. Barrasso conveyed his concerns to President Biden, questioning why a CEO, who has overseen a company's financial downfall, continues to provide counsel on national trade policies.

Adding to the intrigue, since Biden took office in January 2021, he has consistently highlighted and promoted Proterra's achievements. Proterra's electric bus was prominently featured in a virtual White House event hosted by President Biden himself, where executives gave the president a virtual walkthrough of the company's South Carolina facility. Biden expressed personal anecdotes, recounting his time as a bus driver, and even promised to visit the facility in person.

President Biden's green energy aspirations also prominently feature Proterra. He envisions a future where all buses crafted in the USA are zero-emissions by 2030. Additionally, Biden has positioned Proterra as a paradigm of American electric vehicle success, showcasing the brand in multiple addresses about his environment-friendly energy goals.

But the ties don't end there. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has faced her fair share of criticism for her vested interests in Proterra. Prior to her confirmation as Energy Secretary, Granholm sat on Proterra’s board and continued to hold shares in the company post-confirmation.

Barrasso’s final words in his letter to President Biden captured the concerns of many: the continuous promotion and favoritism towards Proterra, in light of its bankruptcy and with governmental support, beckons questions about the rationale behind such endorsements. He emphasized the need for transparency and accountability regarding public policy decisions and the businesses the presidential administration chooses to bolster.

In a world where green energy and sustainable transportation are pivotal, the Proterra story paints a complex picture of politics, business, and the challenges they face together.
