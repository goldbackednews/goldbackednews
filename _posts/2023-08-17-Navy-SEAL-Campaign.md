Former Navy SEAL and now Republican contender, Tim Sheehy, is making waves in his ambition to unseat three-term Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., in a race that's gearing up to be one of the most closely observed contests in 2024.

Sheehy, a distinguished business owner and firefighter pilot, hasn't just stopped at his impressive credentials. Since announcing his Senate campaign in June, he's been bagging noteworthy endorsements, not just from local Republicans, but nationally renowned names as well. The latest addition to his list of supporters is former House Speaker and presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich.

In a video obtained by Fox News Digital, Gingrich proclaimed, "I've looked carefully, and I believe Tim Sheehy is the right fit for a United States senator. He embodies patriotism, hard work, business acumen, and invaluable military service. With public backing, he's the one to set Washington right."

Beyond Gingrich, Sheehy's endorsement list boasts of influential figures such as Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte; Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont.; and several other Republican senators from various states.

Before venturing into politics, Sheehy's illustrious career marked significant service in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America, and the Pacific region. His valor and heroism earned him the Bronze Star with Valor for Heroism in Combat and the Purple Heart Medal. Outside of his military service, Sheehy, an entrepreneur with multiple businesses, also cherishes family life with his four children and Marine veteran spouse, Carmen Sheehy.

While Sheehy is currently the only Republican in the race aiming for a general election showdown with Tester, whispers suggest that Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., might be considering a second shot. Rosendale previously lost to Tester in 2018 by a narrow 3.5 point margin in the staunchly conservative state.

With the Senate's balance hanging by a thread, this race's outcome might very well decide which party takes control. The Democrats, as of now, are holding onto their one-seat majority, backed by three independent senators who align with the party.
