The digital space is the new battlefield for geopolitical conflicts, and the latest reports reveal a disturbing trend: Iran is actively using Douyin, the Chinese counterpart of TikTok, to spread propaganda about the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. This move underscores the complexity of modern warfare, where battles are fought not just with weapons but with information and influence.

ByteDance, a Beijing-based company, owns Douyin, and it seems to have become a platform for the Iranian embassy in China to express its views and garner support. Newsweek’s recent coverage highlights the embassy’s sympathetic stance toward Hamas, particularly in relation to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel. The embassy’s account goes further to lay blame on the United States and Israel, accusing them of aiming to obliterate Hamas’ control over the Gaza Strip.

Since the conflict's inception, the embassy has strategically used short, impactful videos to draw attention to the destruction in Gaza, attracting hundreds of thousands of views. Some videos explicitly label Israel as a "terrorist" nation, while others share footage of explosion aftermaths, blaming Israel for the devastation.

One particular post shared by the embassy features footage from the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City post-explosion. The embassy attributes the destruction to Israel, despite U.S. intelligence indicating that the damage was actually caused by a failed rocket launch by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, a group closely aligned with Hamas.

In a blatant display of antisemitism, another Iranian post on Douyin depicts rockets raining down on Gaza, emanating from the hair of a grotesque caricature of a Jewish person. This sort of hateful content is not only spreading misinformation but also fostering animosity and prejudice.

Amplifying Iran's propaganda efforts, Chinese state media outlets have reposted and supported the Iranian embassy's claims on Sina Weibo, another popular social media platform in China. The concerted efforts of these entities have led to a significant increase in the embassy's influence on Douyin, now boasting over 1.3 million followers.

Beijing, while maintaining robust political and trade relationships with Iran, presents itself as a peace broker in the Middle East conflict. However, it’s crucial to highlight that the country has yet to denounce Hamas’ actions or its connections to Iran, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. This silence speaks volumes and raises questions about the role of propaganda in modern geopolitics, as well as the responsibility of social media platforms in curbing the spread of misinformation.
