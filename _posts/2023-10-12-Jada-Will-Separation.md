In a recent revelation, actress Jada Pinkett Smith has shared that she and Hollywood superstar Will Smith have been living separate lives since 2016, despite still making public appearances as a couple.

During an interview on the "Today" show with Hoda Kotb, Pinkett Smith made the disclosure while discussing her new book titled "Worthy." She stated, "*We live separately*," emphasizing that despite the separation, the idea of divorce is off the table. "*I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through whatever. And I just haven't been able to break that promise,*" she explained.

The separation came about in 2016 after the couple "were just exhausted with trying" to maintain their union. Both had varying expectations of each other, leading them to drift apart. Yet, despite the challenges, they chose not to publicize their separation, even amidst intense media scrutiny. This scrutiny peaked when rumors circulated about Jada's relationship with family friend, August Alsina. The actress confirmed this relationship in 2021 on her show, "Red Table Talk," referring to her involvement with Alsina as an "entanglement."

Interestingly, the revelation also indicates that the couple was separated during Will Smith's notorious 2022 Oscar incident, wherein he slapped comedian Chris Rock. The incident occurred after Rock made a joke referencing Jada's alopecia condition. Recalling the event, Jada expressed her disbelief, "*I thought, ‘This is a skit. I was like, ‘There’s no way that Will hit him.’ It wasn’t until Will started to walk back to his chair that I even realized it wasn’t a skit.*"

Despite the complexities in their relationship, the bond between the two remains strong. "*We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together. We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us,*" Pinkett Smith said.

The couple, who tied the knot in 1997, share two children: Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will Smith also has a son, Trey, 30, from a previous marriage to Sheree Zampino, whom Jada lovingly refers to as her "bonus son."

This unexpected revelation from Jada Pinkett Smith offers a fresh perspective on the couple's relationship, further illustrating the uniqueness of their bond and the strength they share in navigating through life's challenges.
