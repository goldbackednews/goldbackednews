The recently conducted Harvard/Harris survey brought to light an intriguing, yet concerning revelation - an increasing number of Democrats are voicing doubts about President Joe Biden’s mental fitness.

## An Age-Old Concern
Questions surrounding Biden’s physical and mental well-being have been pervasive, and the recent survey seems to underline these concerns. When queried if Biden is “showing he is too old to be president,” a whopping 69% affirmed, leaving a mere 31% believing he is fit for the presidency.

## Democrats Having Second Thoughts?
While a majority of Democrats, 58%, still believe Biden is fit for the presidency, a significant 42% contend he is showing signs of being too old. This growing concern within his party, alongside the already existing doubts among 90% of Republicans and 75% of independents, raises alarms on a bipartisan level.

## A Worrisome Trajectory
The survey disclosed that overall, 58% of respondents harbor “doubts” about Biden’s mental fitness. This figure is inclusive of 31% of Democrats, 86% of Republicans, and 62% of independents. What's noteworthy is the palpable rise in concern among Democrats, which saw a seven-point increase in the last two months, from 24% in July.

## The Trump Take
Interestingly, former President Donald Trump has refrained from targeting Biden’s age, focusing instead on his competency. Trump, in conversation with Megyn Kelly, emphasized that being in one’s 80s doesn’t inherently imply incompetency, citing examples of sharp, competent individuals in their 80s and 90s, including renowned world leaders.

He stated, “He’s not too old. He’s incompetent.” Drawing parallels with other illustrious leaders, Trump argued that age can bring “great wisdom” if coupled with competency, subtly implying that Biden lacks the latter. He even went on to claim that Biden “wasn’t the sharpest tack” even 25 years ago.

## A Concern for the Nation
With discussions on Biden's mental acuity becoming more pronounced and transcending party lines, it begs the question of how it will impact governance and international relations. The trajectory of increasing concern among his party members and opponents alike suggests a need for more transparent discussions on the mental fitness of our leaders.

The persistent doubts and discussions surrounding the President’s mental fitness are not just a political concern but a national one, emphasizing the necessity for clarity and assurance on the leader’s capability to govern effectively and make sound decisions in the interest of the nation.
