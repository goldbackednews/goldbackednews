In a significant breakthrough, Ugandan police have intercepted a major terrorist plot aimed at a prominent church in the capital, Kampala, with six arrests made and multiple explosive devices seized.

The initial arrest took place on Sunday, where Kintu Ibrahim, a 28-year-old individual, was caught attempting to enter the Lubaga Miracle Center Cathedral during services. He had with him a bag containing an improvised explosive device (IED). Patrick Onyango, the police spokesperson, stated that their intel indicated a potential terrorist mission, leading to Ibrahim's apprehension.

Ibrahim's subsequent revelations to the police indicated the involvement of three other conspirators poised to launch similar bomb attacks. Following this lead, on Monday, the police announced five additional arrests and confiscated six more IEDs. These devices, specifically designed with nails to maximize damage, were neutralized safely by expert technicians.

Fred Enanga, another police spokesperson, shed light on Monday's operations, "We recovered more bombs from a private home in Lungujja. The occupants of the home were not around and we are looking for them."

This thwarted plot sends ripples of concern across the nation, prompting official warnings to the public regarding potential "suspicious objects, unusual activity, or behavior," especially in public spaces like shopping areas, transportation hubs, and places of worship.

Behind this potential reign of terror is the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel faction that transitioned into the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the 1990s. Evolving over time, this group transformed into an Islamist insurgency, aiming to establish an Islamic "caliphate" in the region. Their vision mirrors that of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.

Highlighting their broader ambitions, the ADF pledged their loyalty to ISIS in 2019 and renewed this commitment in April 2022. ISIS has recurrently marked Uganda for potential attacks, especially since Uganda deployed troops to counteract jihadists in Somalia. Security experts opine that ISIS sees a golden opportunity in destabilizing central African governments to commandeer valuable natural resources.

In light of these developments, the situation demands international attention and cooperation to counter the escalating terror threats in central Africa.
