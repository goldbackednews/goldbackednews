Amidst the political storm, Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets and former American ambassador to Britain, emerges as a pivotal figure rallying major donors for Donald Trump's potential presidential bid. 

### Loyal Ties and Big Money

A billionaire in his own right, Johnson's relationship with the former president Trump is well-documented. Not only a longstanding friend but also a staunch supporter, Johnson reportedly approached numerous Republican billionaires, advocating for their backing of Trump's campaign. As reported by CNBC, insiders privy to the matter reveal the essence of Johnson's appeal: it's high time to support Trump as he is poised to be the nominee, judging by the polls.

However, not all have been eager to jump onboard the 'Trump Train'. Prominent figures such as Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, steel tycoon Andy Sabin, and real estate magnate Stephen Ross have expressed reservations, with some pointing to the U.S. Capitol riot in January 2021 as a significant deterrent.

### Momentum in Numbers

Not to be overshadowed by the reluctance of some, Johnson himself has made a hefty contribution of $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. As controversies encircle Trump, there's a surprising twist. Trump's popularity among the Republican voter base has witnessed a notable uptick. A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicates that nearly 63% of Republicans are in favor of Trump making another presidential run. This figure marks an increase from 55% earlier this year. Moreover, Trump's favorable opinion ratings among Republicans are up, currently standing at 70%.

However, this surge within the party might not be sufficient in a broader electoral landscape. Trump's challengers from within the GOP suggest that while he might be revered within the party, winning a general election – where reaching beyond the GOP base is vital – might remain elusive.

Only time will determine if Johnson's efforts will lead to a successful touchdown for Trump or if they will face an interception by the larger electorate.
