With the 2024 presidential primaries on the horizon, a rising tide of voices within the Democratic party is debating the viability of President Biden as their candidate for a second term. Amidst the clamor, two potential pathways to replacing Biden have emerged, though the clock is ticking rapidly.

## The Primary Path - Will a Challenger Rise?

Every election year, the Democratic party gears up for its primary election process, a tried and tested system to choose the most suitable candidate for the general elections. Between January to June next year, Democrats will be flocking to polling booths across the nation to cast their vote for a presidential nominee. The early indications? Biden is in for a challenge.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Marianne Williamson have already thrown their hats in the ring. However, the majority of Democratic voters remain unconvinced by their candidacy. The real game-changer would be if a well-established, broadly appealing candidate were to step up.

Gavin Newsom, California's Governor, seems poised to fill that role. His recent actions - touring Republican states, advocating for national gun control referendums, and even challenging Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for a Fox News debate - have elevated his profile, making him a strong contender. But is the Biden camp worried? Publicly, they see Newsom as a valued associate. Privately, rumors paint a different picture.

And Newsom isn't the only name generating buzz. Michigan's popular governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Pete Buttigieg, the current Transportation Secretary who ran for the presidency in 2020, are also considered potential contenders.

The deadline clock, however, is ticking. States have specific deadlines for candidates to declare their intention to run, with Nevada setting the earliest deadline on October 15th. By the end of the year, 14 more states will have set their deadlines.

## The Convention Conundrum - Can Biden Step Down?

The second pathway for Biden's potential replacement lies within the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August next year. Here, Biden has a card to play. Even if he clinches the majority of delegate votes, he has the option to withdraw his candidacy. Should he choose to do this, the convention would turn into a free-for-all.

According to Democratic party guidelines, while pledged delegates aren't obligated to vote for the candidate they initially supported, they are expected to "reflect the sentiments of those who elected them." A Biden endorsement could be a game-changer in such a scenario.

Yet, this isn't without complications. A "contested" convention, where no candidate gets a majority, could devolve into chaos, showcasing a fractured party just months before the general election.

## A Historical Challenge

In the annals of modern political history, an incumbent president has never been ousted from his party’s nomination during a re-election bid. The last time a convention even neared "contested" status was back in 1980 for the Democrats. 

For any potential candidate willing to challenge Biden's nomination, the road ahead is filled with historical precedence and procedural challenges. With the clock rapidly winding down, the Democratic party faces an unprecedented choice as 2024 looms on the horizon.
