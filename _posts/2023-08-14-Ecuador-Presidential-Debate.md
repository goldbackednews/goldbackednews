Ecuador's political landscape was jolted to its core this past week as the assassination of presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, shadowed the proceeding debate. The debate, held on Sunday, saw the participation of the seven remaining presidential candidates, all of whom grappled with the aftershocks of the tragic incident.

Villavicencio, a committed journalist, had been at the forefront of the battle against corruption and was outspoken about minimizing China's growing influence in Ecuador. His brazen stance had made him a target of numerous death threats, notably from drug cartels, a danger he publicly acknowledged.

His shocking assassination has not only traumatized the nation but also cast uncertainty over an already tense election with a whopping 40 percent of voters still undecided. The debate that ensued naturally turned its focus towards the spiraling violent crime rates in the country. Several candidates attempted to harness Villavicencio's voter base, vowing to purge the nation of its corruption.

Prominent among the candidates are five left-wing leaders: establishment socialist Luisa González; indigenous socialist Yaku Pérez; Otto Sonnenholzner, the left-wing former Vice President; Bolívar Armijos, the leader of the rural movement; and progressive entrepreneur Xavier Hervas. On the other side, there's the non-ideological banana industry magnate, Daniel Noboa, and the center-right businessman, Jan Topic.

Notably, González has secured the backing of Ecuador's ex-President Rafael Correa, an influential left-wing figure, who has been residing in Belgium since 2018 following allegations of kidnapping and corruption during his tenure. Villavicencio's journalistic endeavors had previously accused Correa of engaging in deceitful transactions with China, costing Ecuador billions in oil revenue.

The debate highlighted issues such as the country's crime surge, the environment, and economic enhancement strategies. González's responses predominantly echoed Correa-era socialist ideologies, drawing Ecuador closer to global powerhouses like China, Russia, Venezuela, and Cuba. This prompted Sonnenholzner to question her on Correa's vendetta against Villavicencio, which she evaded. The debate's intensity peaked when Topic's tax contributions were scrutinized, with Topic fervently denying any tax evasion.

While the debate unfolded, the Construye Movement, which Villavicencio represented, endeavored to secure Christian Zurita as its presidential nominee. Zurita, a journalist who had collaborated with Villavicencio on a major corruption revelation, now faces hurdles as he was denied participation in the debate due to his unofficial candidate status. With the election date nearing, Construye's lawyers are in a race against time to get Zurita on the ballot.

The 2023 Ecuadorian presidential election was unique even before Villavicencio's assassination. Current President Guillermo Lasso instigated it using a constitutional clause, "muerte cruzada," dissolving the National Assembly after recurrent failed attempts by the left to impeach him, making effective governance a challenge. In a definitive statement in May, Lasso proclaimed, “It is unacceptable that a great part of the time of the ministers and their team be dedicated to resisting the political harassment of the National Assembly instead of working towards solving the problems of Ecuadorian families.”
