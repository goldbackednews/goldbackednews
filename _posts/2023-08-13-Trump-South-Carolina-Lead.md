The 2024 South Carolina Republican primary race has been a topic of keen interest in recent months. The latest National Public Affairs (NPA) survey unveils some intriguing developments, with former President Donald Trump firmly consolidating his lead.

According to the poll, Trump now enjoys a whopping 45% support, establishing a comfortable 32-point lead over Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who stands at 13%. The increase from a 15% lead in May to a significant 32% margin highlights Trump's enduring appeal among South Carolina's GOP voters.

The battle for second place, however, remains tight. Former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina's ex-Governor, Nikki Haley, ties with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both securing 11% of the polled support. Trailing them are former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 7% and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy at 5%. Other candidates are yet to breach the 2% support mark.

What's particularly fascinating is Trump's enhanced appeal among specific voter segments. The former president has seen gains among middle-aged voters, non-college graduates, and evangelical men, which seems to have impacted DeSantis's numbers.

Bill Stepien, NPA's representative and Trump's 2020 campaign manager, reflected on the changing dynamics in the Yes Labels podcast, stating, "Quite a change in just a few months." The declining trajectory for DeSantis, with a consistent 5% drop month over month, became a focal discussion point during the podcast.

The consolidated polling data from RealClearPolitics places Trump with 43.3% support in South Carolina. DeSantis trails at 17%, with Haley and Scott at 13.3% and 9%, respectively.

South Carolina's Republican presidential primary, scheduled for Feb. 24, 2024, is one to watch. Positioned after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, it represents the first primary in the South.

The recent National Public Affairs survey, conducted from Aug. 7-9, drew its insights from 846 likely voters. As the date draws closer, political analysts and enthusiasts alike will be eager to track the shifts and turns in this highly anticipated race.
