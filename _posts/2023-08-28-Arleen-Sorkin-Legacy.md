Arleen Sorkin, celebrated for her portrayal of Calliope Jones on "Days of Our Lives," and for being the original voice behind the iconic DC Comics character Harley Quinn, has passed away at the age of 67. A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.

A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin's husband and prominent figure behind "Modern Family" and "Frasier," confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.

James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC's "The Suicide Squad," expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin's seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. "Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends," he penned.

Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from "Batman: The Animated Series," reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin's exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. "Devastated to learn we've lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person," he shared.

Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin's voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like "Justice League," "Gotham Girls," and "Batman: Arkham Asylum." Harley Quinn's prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie's portrayal in movies like "Suicide Squad" and "Birds of Prey." Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.

However, it wasn't just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the '80s with roles in "Saturday Night Live" and "Trading Places," eventually securing her memorable role in "Days of Our Lives" in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.

Sorkin's versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on "America's Funniest People" alongside Dave Coulier in the early '90s. Her credits also extend to shows like "Duet," "Open House," and "Ted & Venus."

The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.
