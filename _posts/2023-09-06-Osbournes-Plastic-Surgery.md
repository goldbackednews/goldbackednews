In the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, the conversation around cosmetic procedures can be a muddled one. But leave it to Sharon Osbourne, the straight-shooting TV personality, to clear the air.

Teaming up with her iconic family for the return of "The Osbournes Podcast," premiering on September 12, Osbourne pulls no punches discussing her own experiences going under the knife. Comparing these cosmetic procedures to car tune-ups, Sharon's son, Jack Osbourne, light-heartedly remarked that his mom goes in for a "tuneup" every "5,000 miles."

Despite the jokes, Sharon stresses the importance of honesty surrounding plastic surgery. After a botched facelift in 2021 left her physically and emotionally traumatized, she advocates for understanding the risks that come with these procedures. Her experience, unfortunately, led to asymmetrical eyes, scarring, and additional surgery to correct the misstep.

In candid reflections, Osbourne shared how the ordeal played out with the surgeon she trusted. "I looked like a Cyclops. It was the worst thing ever," she stated, emphasizing the importance of researching procedures thoroughly and being prepared for any outcome. No matter how skilled the surgeon, nothing is guaranteed in the world of plastic surgery.

Sharon's openness resonates strongly with many, including her own daughter, Kelly Osbourne. Although Kelly admires her mom's confidence, she remains hesitant about undergoing procedures herself, especially after giving birth in 2022.

For Sharon, the decision to go under the knife is deeply personal, and the stigma often associated with it is unwarranted. With cosmetic surgery now a worldwide phenomenon, she encourages individuals to embrace their choices and reject the shame often cast upon them.

In a world where age-defying treatments are evolving rapidly, perhaps the most valuable takeaway from Sharon's story is not what you choose to do with your body, but how you choose to own and express those decisions.
