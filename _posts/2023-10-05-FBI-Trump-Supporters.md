A recent Newsweek investigation has revealed that the FBI is discreetly monitoring supporters of former President Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 elections. The move aims to prevent any significant civil disturbances similar to those witnessed on January 6, 2021.

The report, based on inputs from over a dozen current and former government officials specializing in terrorism, paints a picture of the ongoing domestic-security landscape. Furthermore, it evaluates the Biden administration's approach to the issue they label as "domestic terrorism."

One anonymous FBI official highlighted the Bureau's delicate task of ensuring safety without infringing upon Americans' constitutional rights. The FBI's concentrated focus on Trump supporters could inadvertently spark anti-government activities that the Bureau strives to mitigate. "It has to tread very carefully," the official emphasized.

President Biden's vocal criticism of Trump supporters, coupled with his administration's portrayal of them as threats to democracy, intensifies the ongoing debate. Such narratives could push certain groups to adopt more extreme measures, especially if they feel marginalized by the system. It's a delicate balance, with heightened stakes on both sides.

Newsweek's access to classified FBI and Department of Homeland Security data led them to question if "terrorism" is the most accurate term to describe these domestic issues. Equally, whether strategies developed in response to global extremist groups like al-Qaida are appropriate for addressing domestic concerns remains debatable.

A notable revelation from the investigation was the FBI's introduction of a new subcategory in 2022: "AGAAVE-Other." This classification encompasses "domestic violent extremists" driven by anti-government or anti-authority motivations. It specifically covers those inclined to target individuals based on their perceived political affiliations.

Though not explicitly stated, insiders have confirmed that the "AGAAVE-Other" title relates to politically-motivated violence stemming from Trump supporters.

However, the FBI has been clear in its stance. They stated that the AGAAVE threat umbrella covers a range of violent extremists, targeting both Republican and Democratic affiliations. This point reaffirms that the investigations are not solely focused on Trump supporters.

Yet, another senior intelligence official candidly shared with Newsweek that Trump's supporters represent a significant domestic threat. The FBI's primary role is to address this potential for violence, they asserted. But the broader question of whether Trump and his followers pose a threat to the nation's fabric is a complex one. The responsibility of answering that, they believe, falls on the entire country, not just the FBI.
