Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., has emerged as one of the leading voices against the dominance of Big Tech companies. However, in a candid admission to Politico, Buck conceded that his endeavors might not see immediate results due to the present composition of Congress.

"Realistically speaking, we won't be seeing significant movement on Big Tech antitrust issues in this session," Buck remarked. Instead of getting disheartened, Buck has shifted his strategy to a more long-term focus, educating new members and setting the stage for future legislative efforts.

Challenges, however, have been no stranger to Buck's cause. His determined drive since 2021 faced its first major setback when the Democrat-controlled House turned down his proposals aimed at curbing the online influence of tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Google.

Adding to the hurdles, Buck missed out on the chairmanship of the vital House antitrust subcommittee in January, a role that went to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. His bipartisan alliance also suffered a blow when former Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a crucial ally across the aisle, left Congress.

But it's not all doom and gloom for Buck's initiative. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has been vocal in highlighting the urgency of addressing Big Tech's influence. He's been releasing a series of documents termed the "Facebook Files," underscoring the extent of the challenge at hand.

Jordan's criticism of content moderation and alleged censorship by major tech companies echoes Buck's sentiment about the pressing need for more competition in the sector. 

Despite the setbacks, Buck remains unwavering. "Yes, I'm passionate about this issue, but I also have to be pragmatic," he said. Recognizing the importance of bipartisan support, he is now focusing on issues where he can bridge political divides.

In a commendable effort to seek common ground, Buck recently collaborated with Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu and Anna Eshoo, both from California, to introduce the National AI Commission Act. This legislation aims to establish a dedicated commission focusing on AI regulations.

Highlighting the need for a thoughtful approach to such pressing challenges, Buck emphasized, "It's pivotal that we bring dedicated experts on board who can address these matters with the depth and nuance they deserve."
