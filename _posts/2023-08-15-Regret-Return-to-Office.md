As employees worldwide adjust to post-pandemic working norms, 80 percent of U.S. company executives confess they regret their initial return-to-office mandates. A new survey brings to light a prevailing sentiment of regret among leaders who might have been too hasty in their decisions.

According to CNBC, the study which spanned over 1,000 American company executives and workplace managers, showcased a majority of bosses acknowledging that they could have been more strategic and data-driven in their approach to office returns. The premature decisions, often driven by the executives' opinions rather than concrete employee data, have led to a wide-scale reconsideration of workplace policies.

Kathy Kacher, a seasoned consultant specializing in guiding companies on their return-to-office strategies, observed, "A lot of executives have egg on their faces and they’re sad about that." Many organizations have had to revise their initial plans, especially after encountering strong resistance from their employees.

Interestingly, the approach towards hybrid work is also undergoing significant evolution. While some leaders have started accepting the hybrid model as the new standard, others have reneged on earlier commitments of flexible working. Current statistics from July indicate that while 59 percent of full-time workers are entirely on-site, 29 percent have adopted a hybrid model, and 12 percent have continued working remotely.

A crucial revelation from the survey was the correlation between employee satisfaction and involvement in decision-making processes. Companies that imposed stringent office return rules without engaging their employees in the discussions are now grappling with challenges in staff retention and recruitment. "They’re the ones struggling with retention and recruitment," added Kacher.

In contrast, firms that actively seek and incorporate feedback from their employees in policymaking appear to be faring better. A prime example is global firm Ernst & Young (EY). By addressing employee concerns related to commuting, child care, and pet care, and subsequently introducing a fund to cover these costs, EY witnessed a staggering 150 percent surge in office attendance throughout the U.S.

In the wake of these revelations, it's evident that the success of post-pandemic work arrangements hinges on a more inclusive and empathetic approach, one where decisions are made collaboratively rather than unilaterally.
