In an era where our online identities sometimes speak louder than our real lives, a digital hack can be devastating. For former 'Bachelorette' contestant, Josh Seiter, this became a nightmarish reality when hackers took over his Instagram account, leading many to believe the worst - that he had passed away.

The internet was in a frenzy when on Monday, a post from Seiter's account announced his "unexpected passing." Understandably, fans were in shock and disbelief, pouring out their grief and condolences. But soon after, a determined Seiter regained control of his account, ensuring his fans and followers that he was, in fact, "alive and well."

In a heartfelt video shared on his Instagram, Seiter revealed, "Somebody was playing a cruel joke and mocking my mental illness and the struggles I’ve gone through with depression and suicide attempts." Expressing deep regret for the anguish caused by the ill-intentioned post, he vowed to work with his team to find the culprits behind this digital crime.

While representatives for Meta, the company owning Instagram, have yet to comment, Seiter's ordeal sheds light on the darker side of our internet-driven society. It's a stark reminder of how intertwined our lives have become with our online personas, and how easily the narrative can be changed, causing immeasurable distress.

Beyond the hacking incident, Seiter's transparency about his mental health struggles over the years showcases a resilience that is both humbling and inspiring. In previous posts, he opened up about his journey, from being committed to a psychiatric ward at 21 and surviving an attempted suicide at 22, to graduating top of his class from law school at 25 and becoming a prominent mental health advocate.

Seiter's message to fans is clear: "Never, ever give up. Your story isn’t written yet. Every chapter is leading to a more perfect ending. I promise." As he moves forward from this incident, the former reality star's tale of triumph over adversity continues to inspire and remind us all of the strength of the human spirit.
