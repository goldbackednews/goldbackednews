Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) did not mince words as she declared that there is absolutely no room in Congress for individuals who share the same anti-Israel views as Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Boebert’s statement comes in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7th, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead. 

The House of Representatives, caught in the midst of political tumult, witnessed a motion last week by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) seeking to censure Tlaib for her vehement criticism of Israel following the attack. However, this motion was tabled with a vote of 222-186, as 23 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. Boebert, unwavering in her stance, was not among the dissenters. 

During her appearance on “Eric Bolling The Balance,” Boebert clearly articulated her viewpoint, stating, “There are lines that members of Congress should not cross, and supporting terrorist groups like Hamas is definitely one of those lines.” She continued by expressing that there is simply no place in Congress for individuals who embody ignorance and hatred to the extent that Tlaib does, voicing her support for the censure.

Since becoming the first Congress member of Palestinian descent in 2018, Tlaib has been vocal in her critique of Israeli policies, calling for sanctions and accusing Israel of perpetuating apartheid in the Gaza Strip. She maintains this stance despite the Palestinians’ self-governing status in Gaza, a result of electing Hamas to power in 2006. 

Boebert did not hold back as she addressed this issue, stating, “There are some [in Congress] who are siding with Hamas during this horrible and brutal attack on Israel, this war that is taking place.” She highlighted that while there are members on the opposite side of the aisle expressing support for Israel, it remains uncertain whether it will translate into concrete action against one of their own.

Emphasizing the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance, Boebert affirmed, “Israel, our nation's most trusted ally, has every right to defend itself. And we are here standing in solidarity as Republicans with Israel every step of the way.” She condemned Hamas’ actions as utterly repulsive and expressed her heartfelt prayers for the Israelis and all innocent victims caught in the crossfire.

Boebert’s strong, unwavering support for Israel and her call for accountability within Congress reflect the conservative values of standing with allies and ensuring that anti-Israel sentiments do not find a foothold in American politics.
