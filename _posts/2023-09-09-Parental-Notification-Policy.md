It's common sense: Parents have the right to know what's happening in their children's lives, especially when it involves significant decisions at school. But the Chino Valley Unified School District thinks otherwise, as evidenced by their new policy.

**Parental Rights Overlooked**
The Chino Valley Unified School District has come under fire with a recent policy, aiming to notify parents only if students specifically request a change in gender pronouns or identities. Thankfully, a California judge, showing a profound understanding of the importance of parental involvement, issued a temporary restraining order against this misguided attempt.

Attorney General Rob Bonta may argue that the policy "rightfully upholds the state rights of our LGBTQ+ student community," but what about the fundamental rights of parents? Aren't they stakeholders in their children's well-being, too?

**Dangers of Non-Disclosure**
The notion that the district could be putting the well-being of transgender and gender-nonconforming students at risk is not in question. The real peril, however, lies in sidelining parents from these crucial discussions. Such decisions about gender identity can have deep emotional, psychological, and even medical implications. Parents should be allies in these journeys, not kept in the dark.

Bonta alleges dangers from "forced disclosures," but what about the dangers of keeping secrets? Many families offer safe environments where children can freely discuss their identities. Assuming all parents are adversaries can be just as damaging.

**Widespread Concerns**
Bonta's press releases underline the "threats" posed by policies like Chino Valley's. But it's critical to note that several districts, such as Anderson Union High School and Murrieta Valley Unified, are also under scrutiny for similar protocols. Why is there a push for secrecy? It raises the question: What's the bigger agenda at play?

**Conclusion**
The ongoing battle around parental notification, with a preliminary injunction hearing set for Oct. 13, promises to be contentious. But one thing remains crystal clear: sidelining parents from the narratives of their children's lives is a dangerous game. It's high time school districts recognize this and prioritize open, transparent dialogues that involve all stakeholders.
