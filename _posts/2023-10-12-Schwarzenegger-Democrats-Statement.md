In an upcoming episode of the "Literally" podcast hosted by Rob Lowe, Hollywood legend and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger shared some strong views on the Democratic Party. Known for his no-holds-barred commentary, the *Terminator* star stated that Democrats aim to "*ruin every city in America*."

During the interview, when Lowe recounted Republican principles as explained by former California Republican Congressman David Dreier, Schwarzenegger pointed out that a key principle missing from the list was "Strong law enforcement."

When Lowe queried the *Predator* star about his thoughts on what Democrats stand for, Schwarzenegger responded emphatically, saying, "*We want to f*ck up every city in America. That seems to be the theme right now*." 

The statement was a reflection of the actor's view of Democrat-led regimes in major American cities, which are currently grappling with debt, crime, and a decline in citizens and businesses. 

However, Schwarzenegger's controversial statements and political stance have been a matter of debate even among Republicans. Despite being a self-proclaimed Republican, Schwarzenegger's views often tilt towards the left. His support for issues such as pro-choice and climate change, and his strong stance on COVID-19 safety measures, have sometimes clashed with conservative ideals. In fact, in 2021, he famously told conservatives "*screw your freedom*" when many opposed the government's measures to combat the pandemic.

Moreover, Schwarzenegger's 2021 comparison of Trump's administration to Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party further drew ire from many conservatives. Yet, in a recent interview with the New York Times, the *Commando* actor reaffirmed his allegiance to the Republican Party.

Whether or not you agree with Schwarzenegger's opinions, his outspoken nature ensures that he continues to remain a significant and polarizing figure in both the entertainment and political arenas. The full episode of the "Literally with Rob Lowe" podcast featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to release this Thursday.
