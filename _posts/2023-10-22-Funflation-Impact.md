Biden's economic policies are posing a direct challenge to affordable entertainment in the US, with almost 60% of Americans reportedly reducing their expenditure on live entertainment. This cutback, ranging from amusement parks to rock concerts and performing arts, is a repercussion of skyrocketing prices, reveals a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Credit Karma.

Further insights from the survey indicate a worrying trend: around 26% of respondents have stopped spending on live entertainment altogether. This percentage has seen a sharp rise from 16% pre-pandemic. This phenomenon, aptly named “funflation”, signifies that a substantial segment of American families is grappling with President Joe Biden's economic reforms.

In 2022, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditures Survey exposed that entertainment admissions and fee costs increased at a more rapid pace than essentials like food and gasoline. To offer some perspective, food-at-home prices surged by a staggering 19.6% since February 2021.

Disney theme parks, a favorite for many, aren't insulated from these economic headwinds. Julie Gibbs, an Indiana-based university administration worker, shared her personal experience, recounting her past visits to Walt Disney World in Orlando, which were reduced drastically owing to Disney's escalating prices. Julie and her family are now reorienting their leisure activities to more economical options, a sentiment echoed by many.

"Disney's continuous price increases give me the feeling that they're perpetually demanding more. It's not a pleasant sensation," Julie expressed to the Journal.

The term “funflation” was recently introduced by Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. She emphasized the skyrocketing prices in her investor note, stating, “Prices for live, experiential activities are spiraling.”

Highlighting this trend, Disney has once again upped the admission charges for its theme parks, with some passes witnessing an increase of up to 21%. The music industry too isn't spared from this price surge. Concert tickets for big names like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen have become exorbitantly priced.

To accentuate the dire state of the entertainment world, the Bruce Springsteen fan magazine, Backstreets, announced its closure after 43 years. The soaring ticket prices, reaching up to $5,000, have doused fans' enthusiasm, the magazine's publisher remarked.

As America grapples with these economic challenges, the repercussions on the entertainment sector manifest the strain on household budgets and underscore the need for revisiting economic strategies.
