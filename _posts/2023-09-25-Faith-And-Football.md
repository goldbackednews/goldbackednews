In an era when professional athletes often utilize their platforms to propagate various agendas and debates, Demario Davis, the linebacker for the Saints, chooses a different path. Davis leverages his platform to speak about God and share messages of faith, hope, and the power of prayer, providing a refreshing contrast and a source of inspiration for many.

## A Message of Faith and Miracles
Davis has been open about his faith and belief in the power of prayer, sharing how it has wrought miracles in his own life. In the last two weeks, he has taken the opportunity to talk to the media about his personal experiences with divine intervention and the healing power of prayer, particularly in the life of his daughter, Carly Faith.

His 4-year-old daughter recently experienced a severe epileptic seizure, which left Davis and his wife deeply shaken but resolute in their faith. “On Friday, my daughter… she had her third epilepsy seizure attack. She started to foam at the mouth… For 30 minutes, she seized, she wouldn’t come back, and we had to call the paramedics,” he shared with the reporters before a game.

Davis continued to share the traumatic experience, revealing how his daughter had stopped breathing twice and how they feared potential developmental issues due to the lack of oxygen to her brain. However, he and his wife persisted in prayer. “So we prayed, and we prayed… I prayed, ‘God, let this just be an attack from the enemy and let him have overplayed his hand, and let my daughter come back stronger than before.”

## Divine Intervention
Davis attests that their prayers were answered. His daughter woke up in the middle of the night, speaking clearer than she had before, a miraculous recovery which he attributed to God’s intervention. “The next morning, my daughter was just so sharp… My daughter’s already sharp, but she was sharper than before,” he shared with joy.

He extended this personal miracle to a broader message about faith and reliance on God, urging people to lay their troubles before the Lord and emphasizing how God is knocking on everyone's door, waiting to be let in. He proclaimed, “And I just want people to know, if you’ve got stuff going on in your life, lay it before the Lord.”

## A Call to Share the Gospel
Davis’s faith-filled messages have received strong public response, prompting him to emphasize the importance of not just practicing Christianity but also preaching it, to extend God’s call to those who might not have heard it. He strongly encouraged others to spread the Word in every aspect of life, be it in schools, courtrooms, or hospitals, as a way to bring salvation and healing to a world in need.

“I can’t be the only person who believes our nation needs salvation. So share the Gospel,” he asserted, concluding his powerful message of faith and divine intervention.

Davis’s steadfastness in his faith and his courage to share his beliefs and experiences serve as a beacon of light and hope in times when the world seems embroiled in divisiveness and strife, inspiring many to turn towards faith and explore the power of divine intervention in their own lives.
