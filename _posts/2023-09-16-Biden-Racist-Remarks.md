In a week already rife with political tension, President Joe Biden added fuel to the fire with a statement that has left many outraged. During a recent speech, Biden seemed to link “African Americans and Hispanic workers” with individuals “without high school diplomas.”

**A Discrepancy in Words**
During his speech at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Md., President Biden remarked:

> We’ve seen record lows in unemployment particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, the workers without high school diplomas.

However, the White House's transcript tells a slightly different story:

> We’ve seen record lows in unemployment, particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, and the workers without high-school diplomas. The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for women now.

It's evident that there's a discrepancy between what Biden said and how the White House chose to transcribe it. The altered version seems to create more distance between minority communities and those without high school education.

**Is this a Pattern?**
It's important to put Biden's comments into context. Over the years, he's made several controversial remarks, leading some to label them as instances of 'ignorant racism'. Among these, he referred to “poor kids” being “just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” and also described former President Barack Obama as "bright and clean."

With a history of questionable statements, this latest incident has further ignited debates about the President's perspectives on race and ethnicity.

As discussions around systemic racism and inequality continue to dominate the global narrative, leaders are expected to choose their words wisely, setting a tone of inclusivity and understanding. It remains to be seen whether this latest incident will be brushed under the rug or lead to broader conversations about the inherent biases that might still exist at the highest levels of governance.
