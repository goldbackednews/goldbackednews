In a startling turn of events, the small city of Goodhue, Minnesota, found itself without a police force after the entire department, including the chief, tendered their resignations.

Goodhue Mayor Ellen Anderson Buck expressed her shock, telling Fox 9, "I think we're all a little bit blindsided by it, but we're resilient, and we're going to move forward." However, she was quick to reassure the city's residents, emphasizing that there would be continued police coverage in Goodhue.

The city's Police Chief, Josh Smith, voiced his concerns to the city officials regarding the challenges of recruitment. "This has been three weeks now, we have zero applicants, and I have zero prospects," Smith shared on July 26. Highlighting the broader recruitment landscape, Smith remarked on the lack of new candidates in the policing profession, saying, "There's nobody getting into the game."

The underlying reasons for this recruitment crisis, as pointed out by Smith, include not just the lack of interested candidates but also competition from bigger cities and an inadequate compensation package in Goodhue.

Chris Schmit, a member of the Goodhue City Council, commended the department's contributions in maintaining security and order in the city. Reflecting the sentiment of many, he noted, "I can probably speak for everyone when I say that they provided excellent safety and security to our community. And the small-town policing that they did, we want that back."

In the backdrop of these local events is the larger narrative of policing in Minnesota, especially in its largest city, Minneapolis. The city recently witnessed the sentencing of the last ex-police officer involved in the 2020 George Floyd case. 

Though the Goodhue Police Department and city officials did not provide further comments to Fox News Digital, the scenario draws attention to the ongoing challenges faced by small-town police departments and the broader discussions about the future of policing in the U.S.
