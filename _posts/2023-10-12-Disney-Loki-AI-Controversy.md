In a controversial revelation, Disney's hit television series "Loki" has been put in the spotlight for its alleged use of artificial intelligence (AI) in crafting its season 2 promotional poster. The incident has led to a wider discussion about AI's growing role in the entertainment and design industry, raising both eyebrows and concerns.

According to a report by The Verge, the recent promotional poster for "Loki" seems to have ties to an image from Shutterstock, a renowned stock photography company. Such a connection becomes problematic when considering Disney Plus's stringent licensing agreement, which highlights regulations against AI-generated content.

Illustrator Katria Raden was one of the first professionals to express her disappointment in the company. She shared her concerns on X (previously known as Twitter), pointing out the AI-generated characteristics evident in the "Loki" poster. Amid various opinions on the matter, Raden emphasized the unnatural aspects of the poster, noting the bizarre transformations akin to "meaningless squiggles" often seen in AI-created imagery.

The heart of the controversy stems from the observation that the "Loki" poster's background seemingly resembles a Shutterstock stock image titled "Surreal Infinity Time Spiral Space Antique." Notably, AI image checkers have identified this stock image as AI-generated. Shutterstock's own guidelines are strict against licensing AI-generated content unless it is produced by their proprietary AI-image generator. This internal tool ensures Shutterstock maintains intellectual property rights over the content on their platform.

In this digital age, it's imperative for artists and creators to be assured of the authenticity and uniqueness of their creations. With tools like AI, the lines between creativity and technology blur. As Katria Raden pointed out, countless artists rely on stock sites to earn a livelihood. She believes that using AI-generated imagery, a byproduct of tech built on "mass exploitation and wage theft," is no different from sidelining Disney's own dedicated employees.

Disney's relationship with AI seems to be a recurring topic. Earlier this year, the entertainment giant faced criticism for reportedly employing AI in the opening credits for another Disney+ Marvel series, "Secret Invasion."

As AI continues to advance, industries across the board will need to determine its ethical and appropriate use. The "Loki" controversy underscores the vital conversation about AI's place in artistic expression and the potential challenges it poses to creative professions.
