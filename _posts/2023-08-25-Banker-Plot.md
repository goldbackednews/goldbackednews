In an unprecedented mix of high-tech communication and old-world crime, a New York banker stands accused of hatching a plot straight out of a crime thriller - a murder-for-hire scheme brokered over Facebook Messenger. 

Reshma Massarone, a seemingly innocuous branch manager at a New York credit union, is at the center of a chilling investigation involving her alleged attempt to eliminate her own brother-in-law during a family trip to Guyana. The alleged price for the hit? A cool $10,000.

From July 20 to August 16, the cold digital confines of Facebook Messenger became the setting for Massarone's machinations. She allegedly reached out to an old friend, urging him to "take care of business." The friend, opting not to get his hands dirty, reportedly offered to act as the middleman, finding a hitman to execute the grim deed.

The narrative deepens as surveillance footage shows Massarone physically withdrawing the funds â€“ a down payment for death. The next scene? A Walgreen's store, where Massarone can be seen making a wire transfer at a Western Union kiosk, sending over 25 $100 bills - a sum of $2,500, presumably a deposit for the hitman.

Her commitment to this dark path seemed clear when she chillingly penned, "No turning back," in a message on July 25, urging the deletion of her contact for fear of being caught.

But like all tales of crime and mystery, the plot was eventually uncovered. How authorities caught wind of this intricate web is still shrouded in secrecy. What remains evident is the unyielding power of digital trails in modern crime-solving.

Currently incarcerated and perceived as a clear and present danger to society, Massarone awaits the next chapter in this riveting saga. Calls to her attorney, Mark Gombiner, have gone unanswered.

In a world increasingly connected by technology, this harrowing tale serves as a stark reminder: the digital realm can be both a tool for connection and, in the wrong hands, a weapon of destruction.
