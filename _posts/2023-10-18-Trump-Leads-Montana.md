New polling results present interesting political dynamics for Montana. Former President Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over current President Joe Biden, while businessman and Navy SEAL veteran Tim Sheehy is poised to challenge Senator Jon Tester.

The Emerson College Poll, unveiled on Tuesday, delves into hypothetical election scenarios and Montana's political landscape. The numbers indicate that 49% of Montana's registered voters would back Trump, compared to Biden's 28% in a prospective 2020 rerun. Diving deeper, 16% would opt for another contender, leaving a mere 7% on the fence.

The same poll paints a dim picture for Biden’s performance, with only 22% endorsing his presidency. A whopping 63% disapprove, casting a cloud over his standing in the Treasure State.

When posed with the hypothetical question of changing allegiance in the next few months, 53% of Trump enthusiasts appear unwavering in their commitment, believing Trump can do no wrong. Conversely, a slightly lesser 48% of Biden supporters echo this steadfast loyalty. The remaining voters are susceptible to swaying, given certain actions or statements by their initially preferred candidates.

Switching gears to the Senate race, Sheehy, armed with several Republican senator endorsements, presents a noteworthy challenge to Tester. Tester, currently in his third senatorial term, attracts 39% of voter support. Yet, Sheehy, relatively green in the political arena, is hot on his heels with 35%. A noteworthy 20% remain undecided, with the remaining 6% leaning towards other candidates. Significantly, the differences are within the 4.6% credibility margin for registered voters.

Emerson's findings underline a distinct gender divide in voter preference. Tester commands the women's vote with a lead of 16 points (46% to 30%), while Sheehy secures a 40% to 32% lead among men.

Intriguingly, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) is rumored to be mulling a bid for Tester’s seat. However, Trump has previously indicated he wouldn't support Rosendale in a primary.

For context, this Emerson College poll was conducted from October 1-4, encompassing views of 499 Montanans, 447 of whom are registered voters. The credibility interval stands at 4.4% for the total sample and 4.6% for registered voters.

With such results, the upcoming elections promise a heated and tight race, and Montana will undoubtedly be a state to watch in the political arena.
