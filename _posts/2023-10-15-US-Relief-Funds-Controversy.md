In a move that has sent shockwaves across political spheres, the Biden administration has allocated a staggering $33.7 million from the American Rescue Plan – a bill fundamentally devised for COVID relief – to the United Nations Relief & Works Agency (UNRWA). This comes amid growing concerns regarding the Palestinian relief organization's alleged affiliations with Hamas, a militant group. Some critics have gone so far as to label UNRWA as "effectively a branch of Hamas."

The allocation was made through the State Department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance program, a part of a more considerable $500 million provision earmarked in the relief bill for the State Department’s refugee and migration assistance initiatives.

Controversies surrounding UNRWA are not new. Over the years, they've been scrutinized for purportedly not doing enough to curtail aid from reaching the clutches of Hamas terrorists. There have been reports suggesting that UNRWA facilities have been used to further Hamas propaganda in schools and even shelter Hamas activities. The left-leaning New Republic, back in 2014, even painted UNRWA as "effectively a branch of Hamas."

Furthermore, an alarming revelation by UN Watch earlier this year put UNRWA schools in the hot seat for allegedly propagating hatred against Jewish individuals and endorsing terrorism. While UNRWA accepted the mistakes of some of its teachers in spreading such material, they assured that no such materials are currently in circulation.

To add more layers to this complex situation, President Donald Trump, during his term, had cut off UNRWA's funding, a move that drew criticism from several quarters, suggesting that this cut-off jeopardized the essential aid needed by Gaza's impoverished residents. Fast forward to the Biden administration, and the funding was reinstated despite the undercurrent of concerns that Hamas might indirectly benefit from such foreign aid.

The revelations from an internal State Department document in March 2021 pointed out potential risks. The document conceded that there was a "high risk Hamas could potentially derive indirect, unintentional benefit from U.S. assistance to Gaza." Yet, it also argued that such risks were justified for national security purposes.

In July 2022, the Biden administration declared its contribution to UNRWA surpassed that of any other entity globally, amounting to over $618 million. The New York Post puts this number even higher, estimating a total of $730 million.

Supporters of UNRWA emphasize its crucial role in the region, highlighting the humanitarian services it provides, such as education, health care, relief, and emergency response. Currently, as per the United Nations, over 220,000 individuals are sheltered in 92 UNRWA schools.

The fundamental question that looms large is whether the aid is reaching the intended recipients without falling into the wrong hands. While UNRWA's role in the region is undeniably significant, ensuring transparency and integrity in its operations is paramount. The debate over the US's funding to UNRWA underscores the intricate balance between humanitarian support and ensuring national security.

As discussions continue and the world watches closely, the onus is on the Biden administration and UNRWA to operate with transparency and responsibility.
