House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, representing California's Republican faction, asserted on Friday that any impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden would only be initiated following a formal vote in the House. This declaration is starkly different from the approach taken by his predecessor, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, during the initial impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump.

>"The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives," McCarthy shared with Breitbart News. "That’s why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People’s House and not through a declaration by one person."

### Historical Precedence

In 2019, Pelosi proclaimed, without seeking a House vote, that the House would commence impeachment inquiries against Trump. This was in the wake of the controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

>"This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically," Pelosi mentioned during a press conference on September 24, 2019.

However, the impeachment inquiries received an official sanction from the House several weeks later, with a vote count of 232 to 196.

### Plans for a Biden Impeachment Inquiry?

Reports from Fox News Digital hint at Republican leaders' plans to introduce an impeachment inquiry against Biden this month. McCarthy reportedly informed GOP members in a confidential conference call that initiating an impeachment inquiry seems to be "the natural progression from our investigations."

Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, representing Ohio's Republican faction, disclosed during a call that McCarthy indicated a possibility of the House voting on initiating an impeachment inquiry next month.

>"What Jim Jordan said was that McCarthy told him that it was…coming to the floor in September," a source shared.

The focus of the potential impeachment inquiry would be the alleged involvement of President Joe Biden in his son Hunter Biden's foreign business transactions. Three separate GOP-led House committees are delving into allegations of bribery and other corrupt activities in relation to Hunter's foreign business ventures.

### What's Next?

As the House of Representatives prepares to reconvene after its six-week August break on September 12, the potential impeachment inquiry may be overshadowed by Congress' efforts to agree on government funding by September 30, to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The political landscape is rife with uncertainty, and only time will reveal the path Congress chooses to take regarding these pressing issues.
