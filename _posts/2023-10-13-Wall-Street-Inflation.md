Wall Street found itself on a tumultuous ride this Thursday as surging inflation figures sent shockwaves through the market. Key indexes took a hit, with investors closely watching as U.S. Treasury bond yields climbed, and consumer prices surged higher than initial projections for September.

The rise in consumer prices can be attributed to mounting shelter costs. However, if we set aside the inconsistent food and energy sectors, the yearly growth in the core figure is the lowest it's been in two years.

Early trading saw the S&P 500 wavering between profits and losses. But by 1 p.m. EDT, after a U.S. Treasury auction for 30-year bonds witnessed lukewarm demand, the index took a definitive downturn.

Michael James, the Managing Director of Equity Trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, highlighted, "The past two months have seen the market grappling with escalating interest rates. Any substantial fluctuation can lead to noticeable ripples in equities."

Post-auction, the S&P 500 recorded a dip of 27.50 points (0.63%), settling at 4,349.45 points. The Nasdaq Composite wasn't spared either, dropping by 85.46 points (0.63%) to reach 13,574.22. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid by 173.77 points (0.51%) and stood at 33,631.10.

U.S. benchmark 10-year yields observed a spike after unveiling the inflation data, reaching a high of 4.728% following a two-day decline. This upsurge primarily weighed down on rate-sensitive sectors like utilities and real estate.

Simultaneously, the iShares Home Construction ETF experienced a drop, and the homebuilding stocks felt the pressure, especially with the afternoon surge in bond yields.

However, not all sectors felt the heat equally. Energy and information technology sectors of the S&P 500 appeared to be relatively more resilient during the trading hours.

With the present climate, traders predict a probable interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve before year-end, followed by sustained higher rates into the next year. Boston Fed President, Susan Collins, hinted at more potential interest rate hikes, emphasizing their goal to align inflation back to its target.

In other news, Israel continues its operations in the Gaza Strip, with a focus on securing its hostages.

As Wall Street braces itself, investors are keenly waiting for the earnings season, set to kick off this Friday. Financial giants like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are scheduled to reveal their quarterly results before the trading bell.

On the stocks' front, Fastenal saw a surge post beating their third-quarter profit predictions. Conversely, Ford Motor witnessed a decline after the United Auto Workers (UAW) union broadened its strike at Ford's most lucrative factory.

With financial landscapes constantly evolving, Wall Street remains the epicenter of activity, drawing attention from global investors as they navigate the ebb and flow of the market.
