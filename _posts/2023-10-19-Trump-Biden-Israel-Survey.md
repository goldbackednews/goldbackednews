Recent findings from CNBC's All-America Economic Survey reveal that if elections were held today, former President Donald Trump would edge out current President Joe Biden by a margin of 4%. The poll, which took place between October 11th and 15th, paints a detailed picture of Americans' political and economic sentiments.

Biden's approval ratings have seen a downturn, with only 37% of Americans showing approval and 58% expressing disapproval. This marks a concerning period for the Biden administration, having the second-lowest approval and second-highest disapproval during his tenure. Particularly concerning for Biden is his approval rating on economic matters, which stands at a mere 32% against a 63% disapproval.

However, amidst the political tussles, a notable highlight from the survey is the strong American support for Israel. In the aftermath of recent attacks by Hamas on Israel, a whopping 74% of respondents believed it's crucial for the U.S. to continue providing military aid to Israel. This backing for Israel's military assistance surpasses support for several other key issues, including securing the U.S.-Mexico border, foreign humanitarian aid at 72%, and military assistance to Ukraine at 61%. 

Moreover, Biden's swift show of support for Israel and promises of additional aid during the conflict did not earn him much favor. Only 31% approved of his handling of foreign policy, and a significant 60% disapproved. Interestingly, this decline isn't limited to the opposition. Within the Democratic party, Biden's foreign policy decisions are approved by just 66% of members, and 74% support his economic strategy.

The survey also highlights the polarization in the American political landscape. Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, 57% of Republicans lean toward supporting Israelis, in contrast to 29% of Democrats and 27% of independents. Meanwhile, a significant chunk of Democrats (44%) and independents (47%) favor a balanced stance.

An intriguing insight from this study is a shift in sentiment when comparing current data with a 2014 survey. Older Americans, especially those above 35, are now more in favor of supporting Israel than before. Young Americans, aged 18 to 34, seem more inclined towards a neutral stance, with 46% believing both sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict should be treated equally.

In terms of government funding priorities, the survey indicated clear party-line preferences. Republicans and independents showed a leaning towards securing the U.S.-Mexico border and then military funding for Israel. Democrats, however, placed military aid for Ukraine and foreign humanitarian aid at the top of their list.

This CNBC survey, with a sample size of 1,001 Americans, provides a comprehensive understanding of the current American political mood and is crucial as we approach future elections.
