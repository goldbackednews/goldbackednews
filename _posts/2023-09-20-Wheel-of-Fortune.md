Vanna White is not leaving her letters just yet! She has renewed her contract with "Wheel of Fortune" for another two years. This extension ensures fans will see her light up the screen until the 2025-26 season.

Meanwhile, Pat Sajak, who's been charming us with his hosting prowess since 1981, is set to retire in 2024. With his departure, Ryan Seacrest will step in to fill those big shoes, starting from fall 2024. Seacrest, who's made waves co-hosting "Live with Kelly and Ryan," expressed his disbelief and excitement about joining this legacy.

Sajak and White, a duo that has become synonymous with "Wheel of Fortune," began their journey together in 1982. As Season 41 unfolds, viewers are in for a treat as they'll see Maggie Sajak, Pat's daughter, featuring the "Word of the Day" on her European tour.

Maggie is also upping the ante for the show's fans. As the show's Social Media Correspondent, she's rolling out the "Fan Fridays" sweepstakes, giving fans opportunities to win exciting prizes every week.

For Seacrest, joining "Wheel of Fortune" is like a dream come true. He recently shared his enthusiasm and gratitude, mentioning how he looked up to Sajak and is eagerly waiting to meet the contestants.

All these new shifts and updates spell out an exciting future for "Wheel of Fortune." As the show gears up for its next chapter, fans worldwide are ready and waiting to spin into the new era!
