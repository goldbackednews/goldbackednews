While claims circulate that "woke" Pentagon policies are amplifying the U.S. military's recruitment challenge, experts suggest that the issue might be deeper and more systemic. The politicization of the military and the current state of the labor market, among other factors, seem to be more significant drivers.

### Declining Pool of Potential Recruits

Peter Feaver, a distinguished professor at Duke University and ex-member of the National Security Council, points out that concerns about "woke" policies have been overly emphasized. He highlights underlying problems such as the shrinking pool of eligible young Americans. Health issues, drug use, and obesity have led to a reduced pool of potential recruits compared to two years ago.

Feaver's recent publication, "Thanks For Your Service," delves into the waning public trust in the military. Despite the military's 60% public confidence as per a recent Gallup poll, this figure represents the lowest since 1997 and is a disturbing trend.

### Politics at Play?

Feaver believes that a significant share of the declining confidence can be attributed to politics. Claims of the military becoming "woke" have perhaps added fuel to this fire.

Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has voiced concerns over the damaging image the military has received from its critics. Wormuth highlights how criticisms surrounding a "woke military" might have inadvertently influenced recruiting.

Prominent political figures, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have criticized the Pentagon's newly introduced diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, suggesting that they have resulted in recruitment setbacks.

### A Balanced Perspective

However, it's essential to strike a balance. Feaver indicates that while some progressive talking points might permeate military training, it's only a fraction of the military's overall training focus. The narrative of the military facing a "woke" or extremist issue may not be as pervasive as projected.

Feaver emphasizes the importance of refraining from hyperbole when discussing the military. He suggests granting the military "non-combatant immunity in the culture wars," allowing for a more nuanced, less politically charged conversation.

### Looking Forward

Feaver underscores the broader challenges that the military faces in recruitment. The appeal of the civilian job market and the sacrifices associated with military service make recruitment inherently challenging. 

But as Feaver notes, politicizing the military only exacerbates an already complex issue. While adjusting rhetoric can help, a holistic approach, understanding the myriad of underlying challenges, will be crucial for the future of U.S. military recruitment.
