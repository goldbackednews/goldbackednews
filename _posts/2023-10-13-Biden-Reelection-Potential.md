In a recent conversation centered on his New York Times bestseller, *Breaking Biden*, Breitbart's Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow made a compelling case about President Joe Biden's resilience and potential for reelection. During an interview on The Charlie Kirk Show, Marlow emphasized that it's a grave error to not "take this guy seriously."

Marlow's research paints Biden as an intricate political player with a vast network established over 50 years. While many have questioned how Biden, often criticized for his gaffes and lacking a captivating ideological stance, reached the White House, Marlow believes he understands the formula. According to him, Biden was instrumental in crafting the Democrat Party's machinery that eventually selected him. "He wasn’t just propped up — the guy was forging a lot of the gears that made the machinery of the Democrat Party," Marlow explained.

One fascinating aspect that Marlow touched upon was Biden's initial intention to hand over his political legacy to his son, Beau. But with Beau's untimely passing and no clear successor to former President Barack Obama, Biden, with his immense knowledge of the party's inner workings, emerged as the most viable candidate.

Highlighting the Democrat's strategy, Marlow remarked, “They are looking for operators, and Joe was the ultimate operator.”

Contrary to popular belief that Biden's regular slip-ups are a recent development, Marlow stated, “He’s always done this nutty stuff.” He stressed that Biden's behavior is consistent over the years. While he acknowledges some extent of mental deterioration, he believes much of the criticism is misplaced. Biden has "always been this way," Marlow reiterated.

Perhaps Marlow's most significant point of the interview was his cautionary statement regarding Biden's potential to clinch another term. Despite the president's seemingly bumbling demeanor, his track record shows a series of wins. If the opposition continues to underestimate him, they might be setting themselves up for a surprise. "We can't shake this guy, and that's why the hard reset needs to take place," Marlow advised.

In closing, Marlow urged a change in the way opponents perceive Biden. Recognizing his strengths, understanding his strategies, and crafting a robust counter-narrative would be crucial for those aiming to challenge him in the next election cycle.

Marlow's book, *Breaking Biden: Exposing the Hidden Forces and Secret Money Machine Behind Joe Biden, His Family, and His Administration*, dives deeper into these insights and is available in multiple formats for those eager to delve deeper into the Biden phenomenon.
