George Soros, the billionaire Democrat donor infamous for championing far-left causes, is now funding an initiative to bolster the image of President Joe Biden on TikTok. But why would Soros show interest in a platform popular among American teenagers? 

### The TikTok Army and Soros' Agenda

Documents brought to light by the New York Post indicate that Soros is bankrolling a “TikTok army” composed of Gen-Z social media enthusiasts. Their main task? To disseminate pro-Biden messages and attack conservative views. The platform of choice? TikTok, which already hosts a vast population of American teens, making them a prime target for political influencing.

Tax filings unveil that Soros’ Open Society Foundation funneled a staggering $5.5 million to Accelerate Action Inc. over 2020 and 2021. Following this, at least $300,000 was directed in 2022 to Gen Z for Change, an organization that flaunts a vast network of “activists, organizers, and creators.”

### Biden's Social Media Aides

While President Biden occupies the highest office in the land, he's actively leaning on Gen Z for Change to amplify his policy messages on social media. Not only has Gen Z for Change met with Biden in the famed Oval Office, but they've also received briefings from top White House officials, including sessions on the U.S. involvement in Ukraine and discussions with Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on the pandemic. 

Gen Z for Change influencers are not shy about their views. They've used their platform to advocate for controversial policies such as abolishing border enforcement, defunding the police, and ending cash bail.

### Where's the Money Flowing?

A burning question remains: How is Soros' money being used by these young TikTok influencers? There's no clarity on how Gen Z for Change allocates the Soros funds among its TikTok squad. What we do know, however, is that their content seems eerily in line with the White House's talking points.

Aidan Kohn-Murphy, the founder of the group, openly advocates for progressive policies such as Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, and Palestinian liberation. With these talking points and a massive platform, he and others are shaping the opinions of countless Gen Z followers.

### Soros: The Puppet Master?

It's worth noting that Soros isn't a novice in the world of influencing public opinion. For years, he's poured funds into left-leaning causes globally via his Open Society Foundation. The recent strategy to tap into TikTok to promote left-wing ideals seems like another feather in his cap of trying to mould public opinion.

However, is it fair for teens, many of whom are not yet eligible to vote, to be the target of such heavy political messaging? As America's future voters, they deserve balanced viewpoints rather than a single-sided narrative bankrolled by billionaire agendas.
