Amidst rising concerns about property crimes, a Washington state farmer recently demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The farmer exercised his constitutional right by holding two suspected burglars at gunpoint on his land until the police arrived.

### Crime Halted by Vigilance

Last Saturday, around 7 p.m., Grant County deputies received a report of two individuals suspected of burglary on a farm in Quincy. The farmer discovered these intruders on his property, allegedly attempting to target two of his farm shops. Acting responsibly and quickly, the farmer drew his firearm, holding the suspects in place until law enforcement could take over.

Upon investigation, the deputies, with the aid of footprints found inside the shops, identified the two men as 45-year-old Glenn Richard of Quincy and 28-year-old Jesus Rangel of Mattawa. Both were subsequently arrested on burglary charges.

### The Broader Picture

Grant County Sheriffâ€™s Office spokesman, Kyle Foreman, commended the responsible gun owners in the county. Speaking to local media, he stated, "We have many responsible gun owners here in Grant County and if they are outside protecting their property, they can certainly hold someone at gunpoint and then call 911 to have us come and investigate."

Foreman further elaborated on the legal grounds supporting the farmer's actions. The law in Washington allows residents to reasonably detain someone who unlawfully enters their property, as long as the detention is reasonable in both duration and manner. This legal provision ensures property owners can safeguard their belongings and lands from potential intruders.

### Supporting the Second Amendment

The story of the vigilant farmer stands as a testament to the critical role the Second Amendment plays in safeguarding individual rights and properties. It offers a compelling narrative in favor of responsible gun ownership, particularly in areas where properties might be vulnerable to such criminal activities.

In a society where property crimes are increasingly prevalent, it's vital that citizens feel empowered and have the means to protect themselves and their belongings. This incident, and others like it, exemplify the importance of upholding the Second Amendment in ensuring that right.
