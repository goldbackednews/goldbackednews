The influencer's arrest has resonated widely among his online community. Supporters have rallied around the hashtag #FreeKai, which quickly gained traction on Twitter. However, critics argue that his celebrity status should not exempt him from legal consequences.

As details continue to emerge about the Union Square riot and Cenat's alleged involvement, this incident highlights the ongoing debate about the influence of social media figures in real-world events.
