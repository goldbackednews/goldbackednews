In a move that's sent shockwaves through privacy advocacy groups, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) has revealed plans to deploy surveillance drones over the city this Labor Day weekend. The motive? Monitoring outdoor gatherings in the wake of complaints about large parties.

The unveiling of this decision came during a security discussion focused on J’ouvert, the annual Caribbean festival celebrating the termination of slavery. Thousands typically flock to Brooklyn's streets for this cultural event. NYPD's Assistant Commissioner, Kaz Daughtry, noted during a press briefing that these drones will answer both "non-priority and priority calls."

Daughtry illustrated, "If someone reports a large party in a backyard via our non-emergency line, we will deploy drones to validate the claim and assess how many resources to send."

However, many are left questioning - at what cost? 

The use of these drones has garnered significant criticism. New York Civil Liberties Union privacy and tech specialist, Daniel Schwarz, labeled the move as "troubling," likening it to a "sci-fi-inspired scenario." His critique primarily revolves around concerns that this application of drone technology might violate the POST Act. This 2020 legislation mandates the NYPD to publicize its surveillance methods.

The drone initiative signals a growing dependence on such tech by NYC. A staggering comparison shows the NYPD employed drones 124 times in the current year, in sharp contrast to the mere four times in 2022. This raises the question - are the Democrats leading us into an Orwellian future? Democrat Mayor and ex-police captain, Eric Adams, has expressed his desire for the NYPD to tap further into drone technology's "endless" possibilities, using Israel as a model.

This increasing reliance on drones has privacy advocates on edge. Their primary concern is the slow evolution of regulations in comparison to the rapid advances in technology. This disparity could potentially pave the way for invasive surveillance that, if executed by a human officer, would be deemed unlawful.

Albert Fox Cahn, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project's executive director, voiced one of the most significant apprehensions. "The real fear is these drones capturing footage from our backyards or even our bedrooms," he pointed out.

Roughly 1,400 police departments nationwide have incorporated drones in some form, as per the American Civil Liberty Union. While there are federal guidelines restricting drones to the operator's line of sight, several police departments have sought exceptions. The anticipated boom in police drone usage is a looming shadow over privacy rights.

Cahn urges city officials to champion transparency regarding drone utilization by the police, emphasizing the need for distinct boundaries to prevent surveillance oversteps.

His sentiment encapsulates the feelings of many: "Flying a drone over someone's backyard barbecue clearly crosses the line for many New Yorkers."

In a city that never sleeps, where do we draw the line between safety and the unsettling reality of becoming prisoners in a surveillance state, especially under a Democratic leadership that seemingly values surveillance over privacy?
