Recent findings from an ABC News/Ipsos poll indicate a substantial number of Americans are expressing doubts about the fairness of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden.

### Trust in Justice Wavers

According to the poll conducted on August 15-16, almost half (48%) of Americans harbor concerns about the DOJ's approach to the investigation. In contrast, only a minority (32%) displayed confidence in the integrity of the probe. The poll's sample included 508 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of 4.7 points.

The timing of this survey is crucial. Attorney General Merrick Garland had recently appointed Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as a special counsel in the continuous inquiry into Hunter Biden. This significant move followed the collapse of a potential plea deal for Hunter Biden in court, a situation exacerbated by disagreements between the prosecutors and Biden’s defense team over the deal's terms.

The central point of contention lay in the details: Biden’s defense believed the deal ensured Hunter's immunity from future charges linked to the investigation. In stark contrast, the prosecutors denied any such agreement, maintaining that subsequent charges remained a possibility. This divergence in interpretations became glaringly apparent during the questioning by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Norieka of the District of Delaware.

### Beyond The Newsroom

The repercussions of the poll and the broader narrative surrounding the Hunter Biden investigation were accentuated by National Review senior writer Noah Rothman. In his piece titled “The Hunter Biden Scandal Is Breaking Through,” Rothman underscored how, despite limited coverage by the liberal media, the investigation's developments have penetrated the public psyche.

Rothman opined that the apparent lack of a clear argument defending the Biden family is pushing the public towards a prevailing sentiment: that something went amiss. He elaborates, suggesting that the scale of Hunter's alleged misconduct is emerging prominently due to the clumsy efforts to conceal it, which faltered the moment they encountered the courtroom. In Rothman’s words, it’s an "ugly narrative" and one that seems to resonate increasingly with voters, as mirrored in the poll results.

As the 2024 election season looms, the evolving perceptions surrounding the Hunter Biden investigation are poised to play a significant role in shaping public opinion and, by extension, the electoral outcomes.
