In an unconventional approach to combat increasing thefts, a Giant grocery store located in Southeast Washington, DC, has taken the drastic measure of removing popular name brands such as Advil, Colgate, and Tide from its shelves. This move comes in response to what the store describes as a tenfold increase in theft over the past five years.

As part of these heightened security measures, shoppers at the store are now also required to show their receipts to security personnel before leaving the premises. Ira Kress, the president of the Giant chain, expressed the store's predicament to the Washington Post, stating that while they aim to serve the community, the current risk and loss levels are unsustainable. He mentioned, "In many instances, people stock the product and within two hours it’s gone."

Products like Tide detergent, Schick razors, Dove soap, and Degree deodorant are among the items no longer available on the shelves. The aim is to deter thieves from targeting the store. Diane Hicks, the senior vice president of operations, remarked on the challenge of maintaining a stock that attracts criminals. She said, "I’ve been leaving it out for our customers and unfortunately it just forces all the crime to come to us."

This decision from Giant follows reports earlier in May by Fox News, highlighting the sweeping security changes the grocery chain implemented across its stores. These measures include restricting the number of entrances and putting a lock on certain products.

Kress made it clear that while these decisions are tough, the alternative of closing down stores due to safety and profitability concerns is far worse. 

This rise in crime isn't unique to Washington. Breitbart News reported a similar surge in San Francisco, resulting in the closure of its longstanding Nordstrom store. The article also highlighted a series of smash-and-grab thefts in California, with one incident involving masked thieves looting a staggering $500,000 worth of merchandise from a jewelry store in Pasadena.

As cities grapple with these escalating thefts, the response from businesses like Giant signals the lengths to which they're willing to go to ensure safety and profitability.
