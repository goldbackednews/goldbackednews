**Governor Greg Abbott Stands Tall Against Unfair Accusations**

Texas Governor Greg Abbott faces unwarranted criticism from New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the Lone Star State's "Operation Lone Star" initiative. Mayor Adams might be looking for a scapegoat, but the numbers and facts reveal a different story.

**Defending "Operation Lone Star"**

Governor Abbott's "Operation Lone Star" is a proactive measure to ensure border security. A component of this mission is the busing of migrants to sanctuary cities, ensuring an equitable distribution and relief for overwhelmed border towns. Contrary to Mayor Adams' portrayal, this initiative was designed with community welfare in mind.

During a September 6 town hall meeting, Mayor Adams seemed to pass the buck onto Texas, exclaiming, “It started with a madman down in Texas [who] decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.” However, his emotional remarks paint a misleading picture.

**Diving Deep into the Numbers**

While Adams bemoans the impact on New York City, he conveniently omits the broader context. Governor Abbott was quick to point out that Texas had bused only 13,300 migrants to New York. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers brought in by federal initiatives.

Abbott’s press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, shed light on this selective narrative. “Mayor Adams was proud of his sanctuary city status until Texas began busing migrants to New York City,” Mahaleris highlighted, emphasizing the hypocrisy of such a stance.

Furthermore, Mahaleris urged Mayor Adams to consider the bigger picture, suggesting he address concerns to President Biden's administration. The federal government, under Biden, has been "flying planeloads of migrants all around the country, straining state and local resources," Mahaleris noted.

**Beyond Finger-Pointing: The True Crisis**

While Mayor Adams seems occupied with shifting blame, Governor Abbott remains focused on the core issue at hand: the safety, security, and welfare of communities.

However, Mayor Adams's alarmist remarks cannot be ignored entirely. The influx from various parts of the world, the looming fiscal challenges, and the broader implications for the nation's socio-economic fabric demand attention.

What remains evident is that the challenge is a national one and not a creation of any single state's policies. While the debate between NYC and Texas heats up, one can hope that the focus will shift from blame games to constructive solutions.
