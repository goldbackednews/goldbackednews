In a ground-breaking study recently released by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, researchers have exposed what they believe to be the true costs of fueling electric vehicles (EVs), significantly challenging the popular narratives surrounding the cost-effectiveness of EVs. 

Authored by Brent Bennett and Jason Isaac, the report titled "Overcharged Expectations: Unmasking the True Costs of Electric Vehicles," delves deep into the direct and indirect costs associated with EV ownership. While many EV advocates loudly proclaim the affordability of electric vehicles, citing costs equivalent to $1.21 per gallon of gasoline, this study brings to light a startlingly different picture.

The authors argue that when you factor in the cost of charging equipment and losses over a period of 10 years and 120,000 miles, an additional $1.38 per gallon equivalent needs to be added. Furthermore, when the costs of subsidies are included, the actual cost of fueling an electric vehicle skyrockets to a staggering $17.33 per gallon of gasoline equivalent.

The study scrutinizes the role of U.S. government regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions standards, in indirectly financing the growth of the EV market. Automakers are left with no choice but to conform to these standards, often resulting in a push towards manufacturing more EVs, or purchasing credits from compliant companies. This scenario introduces hidden costs to traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles, which the study argues are often overlooked.

The authors pose a crucial question: "When an EV owner connects to the electric grid, how much are they paying for the extra generation, transmission, and distribution costs that they are imposing on the grid, and will those embedded costs rise over time?" They conclude that the EV industry, buoyed by federal government support and regulations pushing for more EV production, is masking the true costs of EV ownership.

In summary, the study provides a conservative estimate that the average EV accrues $48,698 in subsidies and an additional $4,569 in charging and electricity costs over a decade. This results in a total cost of $53,267, equating to $16.12 per gallon of gasoline equivalent. The stark reality, according to the authors, is that without continued and substantial government support, electric vehicles will remain more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles for many years to come.

This eye-opening report urges consumers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to reevaluate the true costs of electric vehicle ownership, ensuring that decisions are made based on comprehensive and transparent information.
