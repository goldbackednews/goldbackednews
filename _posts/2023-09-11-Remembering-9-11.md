As the 22nd anniversary of the fateful September 11th terror attacks dawns, Pastor Jesse Bradley from Auburn, Washington, underscores the importance of taking a moment to recall the tragic events that reshaped the nation. 

## Reliving The Past to Shape Our Future

"It is important to pause and remember what happened," said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Washington. "It shapes our path forward." The attacks were not just a series of unfortunate events; they altered the course of countless lives, cities, and the nation's collective consciousness.

## The Legacy Continues

Two years ago, participants of the 9/11 Promise Run brandished American flags, a stark reminder of the unity and strength the nation exhibited post the attacks. Christopher "Dom" Colasanti, a bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, was one of the many who lost their lives during the World Trade Center attack. Bradley remembers him as a teammate from Dartmouth College. He recalls the dedication of the men's varsity locker room in honor of Colasanti, signifying the bonds and friendships formed there. The legacy of such individuals, characterized by connecting, serving, joy, and love, endures.

## Sacrifices and Acts of Bravery

Amid the chaos and devastation, first responders across the country raced into peril, exemplifying bravery and selflessness. Their unflinching commitment serves as a constant source of inspiration. "Love includes sacrifice," Bradley asserts, urging everyone to read about Todd Beamer's final moments. Beamer, aboard Flight 93, courageously confronted the hijackers, preventing further potential devastation in the nation's capital.

Quoting 1 John 3:16, Pastor Bradley emphasizes, "This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters."

## Trust, Healing, and Purpose in Faith

Anchoring his message in faith, Bradley references the national motto, "In God We Trust." A relationship with God, he believes, offers healing, restoration, and an unyielding hope surpassing any sorrow. Echoing Psalm 46:10, he emphasizes, "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."

The pastor concludes with a powerful call to action, cautioning against complacency and idolatry. He inspires with the words, "If you are overcoming tragedy and trauma, remember that you are loved." The message is clear: On the anniversary of September 11th and always, "We remember our loved ones," and we discover peace and profound purpose.
