In a passionate appeal to United Auto Workers (UAW) members, former President Donald Trump cautioned against President Joe Biden's vigorous push for electric vehicles (EVs). Trump posited that if Biden's vision for an all-electric automotive industry materializes, Michigan might bid farewell to its iconic auto industry. But who stands to gain from such a shift? Trump believes China.

On a Labor Day post on Truth Social, Trump minced no words in his warning: “The Great State of Michigan will not have an auto industry anymore if Crooked Joe Biden’s crazed concept of ‘all Electric Cars’ goes into effect.” Trump continued, stating unequivocally, “CHINA WILL TAKE IT ALL, 100%. United Auto Workers, VOTE FOR TRUMP.” 

Trump's concerns echo that of the UAW, which has been vocally critical of Biden's green energy initiatives. At the heart of their grievance lies the Inflation Reduction Act. Under this legislation, substantial tax credits are offered to major automakers for EVs produced in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. UAW President Shawn Fain expressed the union's frustrations, noting that while the "Big Three" automakers are capitalizing on billions in government subsidies to pivot to electric, the rewards aren't trickling down to the workers. In his words, "the corporate elite and the billionaire class, seem to think they can keep calling the shots."

A chilling example of this disconnect is the Lordstown community's experience in Ohio. After GM shut down its manufacturing plant in Lordstown, resulting in thousands of layoffs, the community had placed its hopes on Ultium Cells, GM's new EV battery plant venture with LG. However, the reality did not meet expectations. Dave Dellick from UAW Local 1112 shared that while the plant's inception was anticipated as the "next wave" of manufacturing opportunities, it has been a letdown so far. Fain summed it up by saying that Ultium Cells slashed auto wages by half.

The UAW's apprehensions about Biden's push for EVs seem to resonate with their lack of endorsement for his administration. Their stance has been clear: they want unequivocal support from the national leadership before they pledge any allegiance.

As Trump courts the UAW with promises of preserving their jobs and expanding choices, Biden's administration faces the challenge of balancing green initiatives with the immediate needs and concerns of America's working class.
