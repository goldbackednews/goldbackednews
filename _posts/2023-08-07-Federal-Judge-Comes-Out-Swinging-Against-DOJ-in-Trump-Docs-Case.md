In a recent development surrounding the classified documents case related to former President Donald Trump, a federal judge has come out swinging against the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Special Counsel.

According to sources, the judge, who has chosen to remain unnamed for the time being, has expressed his dissatisfaction over the delay in handing over the classified documents pertaining to the former President.

The documents in question are said to contain classified information about Trump's term in office. The case has received significant attention due to its potential implications on the former President and his administration.

In his statement, the judge lambasted the DOJ and Special Counsel for what he called "an unnecessary delay" that is "hindering the course of justice." He ordered them to expedite the process and submit the required documents at the earliest.

The court's decision puts additional pressure on the DOJ and the Special Counsel, whose handling of the case has drawn criticism from several quarters. It remains to be seen how they will respond to the judge's directive.
