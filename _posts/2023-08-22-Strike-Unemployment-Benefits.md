In a move stirring considerable debate, a group of Democrats from California is poised to suggest a measure that would see workers on strike receiving unemployment benefits. With an anticipated release of the proposal's language in the upcoming days or weeks, it's clear this legislation will touch on heated arguments around the nature of employment, workers' rights, and fiscal responsibility.

## A Deep Dive into Debt

Under the proposed measure, striking workers would benefit from California's unemployment insurance program, currently $18 billion in debt. The backdrop to this controversial idea is the widespread strike activities from screenwriters and actors, which have halted many film and TV productions. Opponents of the legislation argue that strikers, who voluntarily forgo work, shouldn't be classed alongside individuals who are unexpectedly unemployed.

Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce, vocalized his opposition, stating, "Striking people are not the same as people who have been let go and don't know where their next paycheck will come from. Someone on strike knows where their job is."

## Previous Attempts and Current Climate

This isn't the first attempt to provide unemployment benefits for strikers. Back in 2019, Former state Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez proposed similar legislation when there was a surplus in the unemployment insurance program, but the proposal failed to become law. The state's current economic landscape, with its high unemployment rates and sluggish wage growth, might further challenge the adoption of such a proposal.

Moreover, the mismanagement shadow that has lingered post the COVID-19 pandemic, where billions in fraudulent unemployment claims were processed, further complicates the issue. U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley emphasized this point, noting how California had to resort to a substantial loan from the federal government, only to later default on it.

## Funding Strikers: Who Bears the Cost?

If passed, businesses might find themselves indirectly funding the strikers. As Rob Moutrie highlighted, "Employers pay per employee taxes to replenish the unemployment insurance fund. If this money is directed to strikers, it essentially becomes an indirect tax on every employer in California supporting those on strike."

Such an arrangement raises concerns about the fairness, especially for businesses that either do not have striking employees or have never experienced a strike.

While Democratic Assembly Members Laura Friedman and Chris Holden, along with Senate Appropriations Chair Anthony Portantino, have shown support for the anticipated bill, its implications on California's already strained economy remain to be seen. 

Opinions are starkly divided, with critics voicing concerns about the "fairness problem" and supporters viewing it as a timely aid for workers during unrest. As the debate rages on, all eyes will be on the Golden State's legislative chambers in the coming weeks.
