It seems like Catwoman's not thrilled this time around.

In a recent Instagram clash, Hollywood actress Halle Berry voiced her disapproval when rapper Drake and singer SZA used a 2012 photograph of her to promote their fresh track "Slime You Out." What's the catch? They did it without asking her first.

## The Slimy Situation

The controversial photo features Berry at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, where she is seen covered from head to toe in the iconic green slime. As it is customary at the Kids' Choice Awards, celebrities often end up covered in this playful goop. But for Berry, the problem wasn't the slime – it was its unexpected and unauthorized use.

Earlier this week, both Drake and SZA gave their fans a sneak peek of the song on their Instagram accounts, where they shared the slimed snapshot of Berry.

Berry didn't remain silent. On her own Instagram, she shared a mysterious message: "SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER GUY…EVEN IF YOU'RE A WOMAN!" Diving into the comments section, Berry further revealed her feelings, saying, "Didn't get my permission," and "That's not cool I thought better of him!" 

She further emphasized, "When people you admire disappoint you you have to be the bigger person and move on!"

## The Silence from the Stars

Despite the controversy, representatives for all three – Berry, Drake, and SZA – haven't made any public statements addressing the situation.

The song in the midst of this dispute, "Slime You Out," was launched on September 15. Interestingly, the artwork for the song will also serve as the cover for Drake's upcoming album, "For All The Dogs." The rapper has also recently shared that his fans will have to wait a bit longer for his eighth studio album, now set to drop on October 6.

As the entertainment world watches, only time will tell how this slimy situation unfolds.
