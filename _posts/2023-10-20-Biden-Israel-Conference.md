In a recent press conference held in Tel Aviv, President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities have been brought into sharp focus. Critics, including Oscar-nominated actor James Woods, voiced significant concerns regarding Biden's apparent inability to maintain coherence during his speech.

While seated next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden, despite relying on prepared notecards, seemed to drift off-topic, ultimately appearing to lose his way entirely. Such instances intensify worries surrounding his mental fitness, with Woods even pointing to Biden's "obvious dementia". 

Woods, who has never been one to mince his words, labeled Biden as a "crooked hack" following this event. He further criticized Biden for his ambiguous terminology, particularly his use of the term "other team" in lieu of directly addressing the terrorists affecting Israel.

Beyond these remarks, the conference's content itself was newsworthy. Biden announced a whopping $100 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza and the West Bank. This move is seen by some as further evidence of Biden's shifting stance on Israel. Recent works, such as Alex Marlow's book "Breaking Biden", highlight alleged harm the current US President has directed towards Israel, including efforts to rejuvenate the Iran Nuclear Deal. Moreover, claims have been made of Biden staffing the Pentagon with so-called "experts" who were later revealed to have ties to Iran.

Critics argue that this is not merely an isolated event, but rather a continued pattern of Biden's inadequacy to govern effectively, with Woods even suggesting that "the fate of mankind is at stake" with Biden at the helm. 

It's imperative to stay informed, critically assess our leaders, and ensure transparency and efficacy in governance. Only through scrutiny and holding our leaders accountable can we hope to pave a path forward that aligns with the best interests of the people.
