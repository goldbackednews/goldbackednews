With rising tensions and violent attacks witnessed in Israel, particularly from groups like Hamas, it brings to the forefront a pressing debate on private gun ownership. Unlike the United States, which boasts of the Second Amendment that champions an individual's right to bear arms, Israel's private gun ownership landscape paints a starkly different picture.

As per reports from the BC, merely 2% of the Israeli population own guns. This is a far cry from the United States, where a study from Rutgers University's New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center posits that approximately six in ten Americans are gun owners.

The primary distinguishing factor here is the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution. This amendment safeguards an American's right to gun ownership from birth. In stark contrast, Israelis can own firearms only to the extent permitted by their government. Not just this, Israel sets strict limits on the type of firearms and the amount of ammunition one can possess. To put it into perspective, while an Israeli might typically be permitted a pistol with a cap of 50 bullets, Americans, depending on the state they reside in, can own a plethora of guns and amass as much ammunition as their pockets allow.

Highlighting the sheer volume of firearms in America, it's estimated that nearly 25 million semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15s and AK-47s, are in circulation. This statistic means there are more of these firearms in the U.S. than "Ford F-Series trucks on the road." Summing up all firearm categories, America sees an astounding figure of over 434 million privately-owned guns. Meanwhile, Israel's limitations confine citizens mostly to handguns with limited bullets.

As the debate rages on, the University of Sydneyâ€™s Gun Policy center has underlined that unlike the U.S., Israel does not legally guarantee the right to private gun ownership. However, in the face of increasing threats, there's been a notable surge in the number of Israelis seeking gun licenses. From 19,000 applications in 2021, the figure jumped to 42,236 the following year.

In a bid to counteract terrorism and bolster civilian safety, earlier this year, Israel's security cabinet endorsed measures that streamline the process for civilians to carry firearms. The changes even encompassed rescinding the residency and citizenship of identified terrorists. Sources indicate that the high-level security cabinet is mulling over augmenting the response mechanisms against terrorism. This might include enhancing the funding for firearm purchases and fast-tracking the issuance of gun licenses.

In the wake of recent events, some analysts speculate that Israeli authorities could potentially expand the gamut of weapons that its citizens can privately own. Whether this shift would significantly alter the security landscape of the nation remains to be seen. But one thing's for certain, as terror threats loom large, Israel's gun ownership policies are under intense scrutiny, and changes, if any, will reverberate on the global stage.
