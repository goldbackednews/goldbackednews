In a recent mandate, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has directed Norfolk Southern Corp. to intensify cleanup operations in East Palestine, Ohio. This comes after the February derailment of a freight train operated by the company.

Norfolk Southern Corp. is now instructed to further investigate the presence of an oily sheen or film observed on water and sediments of two significant creeks in East Palestine. These creeks, known as the Sulphur Run and the **Leslie Run**, have been showing signs of environmental impact post the mishap.

The EPA's spokesperson stated, "The work executed following this order will essentially determine the need for further cleanup to negate any possible long-term repercussions."

The situation escalated in February when the train, approaching the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, derailed, leading to a colossal fire. To manage the aftermath, Ohio performed a controlled release of hazardous chemicals at the site merely three days post the incident.

To provide a clearer picture of the extent of the environmental damage, the EPA's investigation aims to span approximately five miles, focusing especially on the affected sections of the mentioned creeks.

EPA Regional Administrator, Debra Shore emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating, "With this directive, Norfolk Southern is expected to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the waterways, ensuring there are zero long-term adverse effects stemming from the derailment."

The restoration strategy also encompasses the cleaning of various culverts. This is to eliminate any affected sediment in Sulphur Run, particularly downstream of where the derailment transpired.

Addressing the new mandate, Norfolk Southern Corp. expressed its intent to collaborate, remarking that this directive essentially "formalizes the work that has been in progress post the derailment, albeit under a distinct regulatory framework." The company reiterated its commitment, highlighting its ongoing collaboration with both the EPA and Ohio EPA. They concluded by assuring their relentless efforts to mitigate the derailment's impacts on the Sulphur and Leslie Runs.

This initiative by the EPA reflects the agency's continued commitment to protecting and preserving environmental quality, especially in the aftermath of unforeseen incidents. It also showcases the importance of corporate responsibility in addressing environmental concerns.
