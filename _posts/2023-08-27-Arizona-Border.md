A recent report has shone a spotlight on an alarming situation on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Biden administration, in what some critics view as a perplexing move, has allegedly welded border wall gates open near Lukeville, Arizona. This has paved the way for migrants to simply walk into the Arizona desert, unimpeded.

According to the *New York Post*, Border Patrol officials eventually owned up to the decision to weld open flood gates in sections of the border wall near Lukeville. Initially, attempts were made to redirect blame onto other federal bodies. This move has coincided with a surge in migration, making this area the most active border sector in the country.

Data underscores the gravity of the situation. In July, the Tucson Sector marked the highest migrant apprehensions nationwide. With close to 40,000 migrants apprehended, it showed a dramatic hike - a whopping 136% over July 2022's figures. Moreover, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports indicate that the sector has been in the spotlight, with year-to-date apprehensions trailing only slightly, logging in an arrest of around 274,000 migrants. This represents a 59% jump from the previous year's numbers for the same time span.

For many migrants, the unexpected opening came as a surprise. One migrant from Ecuador remarked, "We thought the agents were going to say something to us, but we just got in.” Meanwhile, a Cuban migrant found it easier to enter the U.S. than navigating through Mexico, expecting more security on the U.S. side.

The official reason for the gates in the border wall is to allow passage for monsoon-season floodwaters and migratory animals. CBP officials stated, “High water flow combined with excessive sediment and debris buildup can stress or comprise the design integrity of the barrier.” However, Brandon Judd, the President of the National Border Patrol Council, highlights the rapid adaptability of Mexican cartels. They swiftly identify these wall vulnerabilities and capitalize on them, monetizing these gaps.

Judd expounds, “Because the cartels are constantly surveilling what we do, the moment something gets left open, it gets exploited.” The immediacy of the exploitation underlines the efficiency of these criminal cartels in leveraging any apparent lapses.

The *New York Post* feature was complemented by multiple photographs, vividly capturing the welded-open gates and migrants freely traversing through. One particularly jarring image showcases a steel spike affixed to the ground, ensuring the gate remains open.

With the numbers indicating an uptick — from an average of 821 migrants apprehended daily in June to about 1,200 in July, and a projected 1,483 migrant apprehensions per day in the first fortnight of August — the question remains: Was this a calculated move or a mere oversight?

Only time will tell if the administration addresses these concerns and what measures, if any, will be implemented to manage the situation.
