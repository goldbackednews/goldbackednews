Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) and a source familiar with the testimony allege Joe Biden had no involvement with Hunter Biden’s business affairs, despite Hunter putting his father on speakerphone more than 20 times. This is the cornerstone of the establishment media and Democrats' argument that Hunter Biden only sold an “illusion of access” to then Vice President Joe Biden to his various foreign business partners.

Goldman questioned, “If he [Joe Biden] says, ‘Hello’ to someone that he sees his son with, is he supposed to say, ‘Hi, son. No, I’m not gonna say, ‘Hello’ to the other people at the table or the other people on the phone?”

He told reporters “It’s kind of a preposterous premise to think that a father should not say, ‘Hello’ to people that the son is at dinner with.”

On CNN Goldman further explained his impression of Archer’s testimony, “The brand that he was talking about is Hunter’s own experience as a lobbyist and a lawyer in Washington, D.C., combined with the Biden name, which, of course, is no different than the Trump name or the Clinton name or any other big political family name.”

But Biden’s former business associate, Tony Bobulinski, contradicted the claims made by Goldman. “Hunter and Jim and I are there, and Hunter gets up and talks to his father when he comes in,” Bobulinski told the New York Post. “He then brings Joe over and introduces me, saying he’s the one who’s helping us with the business we’re doing with the Chinese.”

GOP members called Joe Biden’s involvement much more than an “illusion.” Republicans’ belief the Biden family sold its “brand,” a word used by Archer in his testimony, was evidenced by the more than 20 phone calls.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) said in a statement, “Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ that his son sold around the world to enrich the Biden family.” The statement continued, “When Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, he joined Hunter Biden’s dinners with his foreign business associates in person or by speakerphone over 20 times.”

Evidence was produced by Archer’s testimony implicating Joe Biden participated in a bribery scheme where a foreign company paid Hunter Biden to use the Biden “brand.”
