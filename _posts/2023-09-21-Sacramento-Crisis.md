Sacramento, California's capital, is often bustling with politicians and city leaders. But recently, it's the growing number of tents and makeshift shelters that are stealing headlines.

## From the Golden State to a Homeless Crisis

Democratic District Attorney Thien Ho of Sacramento County is up in arms against his city. Why? It's over the homeless conditions which, according to him, resemble those of a "Third World country." 

On Tuesday, Ho announced a civil lawsuit against Sacramento. The lawsuit accuses the city of allowing a public safety crisis concerning its homeless population. And the numbers back his claim: In just seven years, the unhoused population in Sacramento has skyrocketed by over 250%. 

"Our community is on the edge," the lawsuit reads. "We have homeless folks living in conditions you'd find in severely underdeveloped countries. Meanwhile, the rest of us are caught between wanting to help and dealing with the chaos."

## The Tipping Point

Ho lamented the repetitive cycle the city seems to be stuck in. "It's like Groundhog’s Day," he said, "where the situation remains grim, and nothing improves." 

Problems stemming from the increasing homelessness are becoming hard to ignore. Both Judge Michael Bowman and District Attorney Ho have voiced concerns about growing homeless encampments near the courthouse. These settlements are not just an eyesore but also pose genuine threats. Reports include instances of assault, public misconduct, and other disturbances which, according to Ho, compromise the safety of jurors, victims, and witnesses.

## A Plea for Change

The city's response to this escalating crisis has been, to many, unsatisfactory. Mayor Darrell Steinberg promised the initiation of the "Miller Park Safe Camping" to alleviate the situation, but three months on, conditions appear to have only deteriorated. Instances of assault and harassment linked to the homeless population have surged, further deepening the divide.

A survey conducted by Ho's office in July asked locals how the 16 main homeless encampments across Sacramento affected their lives. Out of nearly 3,000 responses, many recounted harrowing experiences. Residents reported assaults, disruptions to community events, and continuous harassment by homeless individuals. Some even stated that their pleas for help from City Hall either went unanswered or were met with dismissive remarks.

However, in response to the lawsuit, City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood expressed disappointment, stating the DA seems more keen on laying blame than seeking solutions. Mayor Steinberg termed Ho’s actions a "performative distraction," yet acknowledged the frustrations faced by residents due to the ongoing crisis.

Sacramento's struggle highlights the broader challenges many California cities face with their growing homeless populations. While solutions may be complex and multifaceted, the need for actionable change is evident.
