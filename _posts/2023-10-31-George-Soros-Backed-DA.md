In a cruel twist of irony, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, a beneficiary of George Soros’s deep pockets, recently found herself at the mercy of the very crime wave she is accused of enabling. Last Friday, in broad daylight and the heart of crime-ridden Oakland, Price's work laptop was stolen right out of her vehicle.

The incident occurred near a family justice center, a supposed safe space, revealing the extent of lawlessness that has gripped Oakland. Price’s bodyguard, despite driving a $90,000 county Tahoe SUV, could do nothing but watch as the thieves made off with vital equipment.

This disturbing event raises critical questions about Price’s capability and willingness to tackle the rampant crime in Oakland, the largest city in her jurisdiction. Since her election in 2022, backed by none other than leftist billionaire George Soros, crime in Oakland has skyrocketed. Her soft-on-crime policies, a hallmark of Soros-backed district attorneys, have created an environment where criminals operate with impunity.

Oakland’s descent into chaos can be traced back to the city’s embrace of the “Defund the Police” movement. Former Mayor Libby Schaaf led the charge, advocating for not just defunding, but replacing the police. The city even went as far as to abolish its school police department. These radical moves have left residents and law enforcement demoralized and defenseless.

Price's response to this lawlessness? In a stunning display of disconnect, she claimed to feel safe living in East Oakland, a statement that flies in the face of the experiences of countless residents and victims of crime. These residents, once hopeful, are now disillusioned, living in fear in what they describe as a failed progressive utopia.

Even law enforcement is feeling the pressure, with police encouraging residents to use air horns to deter thieves. Meanwhile, Price’s response to the crime spree, her stolen laptop, and the recall filed against her in August remains to be seen.

In the end, the theft of Price’s laptop is not just a personal loss; it is a symbolic representation of the failed policies and lack of leadership that have left Oakland in disarray. It serves as a stark reminder to conservatives everywhere of the dangers of Soros-backed officials and the high price of progressive, soft-on-crime policies.

This incident should serve as a wake-up call for voters in Oakland and across the country. The need for strong, law-and-order leadership has never been more apparent, and the time for accountability is now.
