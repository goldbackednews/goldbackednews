The bustling digital age has not been kind to Hollywood's big-ticket streaming platforms. Wall Street's investors, as cited by The Wall Street Journal, are casting a skeptical eye, pointing to what they describe as "hopeless economics" for these services. But what does this mean for the average consumer?

### An Oversaturated Market
Streaming services might be today's trend, but there's a glaring problem: overproduction. Hollywood pumps out over 300 new TV shows annually. Surprisingly, around 290 of them don't resonate with viewers, leading to enormous monetary losses on content that's left unseen. With the latest writer's contract in play, insiders predict that the number of scripted shows could potentially drop by a third in the coming years.

### Keeping Viewership Numbers Close to the Chest
In an industry that thrives on numbers, streaming services have surprisingly resisted revealing their viewership data. Despite writers pushing for transparency, streaming giants have decided against publicizing these figures, sharing only aggregate data with the Writers' Guild. The reluctance to disclose such information could be attributed to a fear that poor viewership numbers might adversely impact stock prices.

### Consolidation - The Next Step?
With a multitude of streaming services vying for attention, the market's future might lie in "consolidation." Think of it as a streaming package deal, where for a fixed fee, consumers get access to multiple platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and ESPN. It might sound familiar; this strategy reflects the model that cable TV followed, where viewers paid for a bunch of channels, many of which they rarely watched.

However, critics argue that this consolidation is just a ruse to recreate the old Cable TV model, where content merit took a backseat. In the golden era of cable TV, viewers paid for multiple channels, leading to a content glut filled with ads, repetitive shows, and often biased programming.

### The Need for Merit-Based Content
One of the glaring differences between cable TV and streaming services is the need for content merit in the latter. Consumers choose their subscriptions based on the quality and appeal of the content. Streaming platforms can't afford to rest on their laurels, unlike the old cable TV days. If these platforms opt for bundled packages, it might allow them to slip back into the old content production patterns, leading to more generic, less engaging programming.

### Exploring Free Alternatives
For viewers tired of paying for content they don't enjoy, there are alternatives like PlutoTV, FreeVee, and Tubi. These platforms offer a plethora of shows and movies, ensuring that viewers don't need to dig into their pockets for quality entertainment.

### Final Thoughts
The world of streaming is at a crossroads. As Hollywood grapples with the challenges of producing engaging content and staying profitable, viewers should be cautious. After all, it's about value for money and getting the quality entertainment that viewers deserve. As the industry evolves, it's up to consumers to vote with their wallets and ensure they're getting the best bang for their buck.
