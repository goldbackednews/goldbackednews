In an unforeseen twist, the Fulton County (Georgia) Clerk of Courts Office has openly confessed to a significant blunder. An indictment pertaining to former President Donald Trump was prematurely posted on their website before an official grand jury decision was reached.

In an exclusive conversation with local media, WSB-TV, Ché Alexander, the Fulton County Clerk of Superior and Magistrate Courts, acknowledged her oversight, attributing it to the immense pressure she felt to guarantee that the indictment process progressed without a hitch.

The posted document, bearing striking similarities to the indictment that was officially released later that Monday night, accused Trump and 18 others of several charges. These included infractions against the Georgia RICO Act (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), conspiracy for committing the submission of counterfeit documents, and others.

The unexpected post stirred quite a controversy after Reuters reported on it, leading to the Fulton County Court hastily pulling it down. In a subsequent official statement, the court termed the document as "fictitious", cautioning the media about treating such unauthenticated documents as official releases.

Explaining the situation, Alexander stated, "I'm only human." She had intended to make the documents swiftly available to the public, but inadvertently ended up causing the confusion. She further clarified her stance, dismissing any claims of political bias in the indictment proceedings. "I had no stake in the matter," she asserted. "It was merely a system work sample, and on saving, it inadvertently entered the press queue."

Elaborating on her use of the term "fictitious" in her statement, Alexander mentioned it was the most appropriate word she could think of. "The document wasn't authentic. It lacked an official stamp," she justified.

Post this incident, her office has been flooded with a barrage of threatening calls and emails. Aiming for transparency and hoping to put the matter to rest, Alexander decided to come forth and elucidate what truly transpired.
