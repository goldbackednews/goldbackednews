Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has thrown her full support behind former President Donald Trump, endorsing him as the "fighter that our country needs." The announcement came during the South Dakota Republican Party’s Monumental Leaders Rally held in Rapid City, South Dakota, where Noem shared the stage with the former President.

Quoting Teddy Roosevelt's renowned "Citizenship in a Republic" speech, Noem said, “It is my honor to present to you the man in the arena. He is a man of significance. He is the leader, the fighter that our country needs. He has my full and complete endorsement for president of the United States of America. I will do everything I can to help him win and save this country.”

Speculation had been rife leading up to the rally about Noem’s endorsement and Trump’s appearance, with many considering Noem as a possible vice-presidential candidate if Trump secures the nomination. Addressing the rally, Noem acknowledged the buzz, revealing that she had been inundated with queries about the night's event.

Highlighting the dedication of the former President, Noem described how, while many other presidential hopefuls declined invitations to attend the rally, Trump immediately pledged his attendance. She praised Trump's dedication to Americans, stressing that "he shows up for every American and fights for us every day."

One of the critical issues Noem brought to the forefront was the situation at the U.S. Southern border. She praised Trump's actions during his term, emphasizing his strategy of "peace through strength" and portraying him as the only trustworthy candidate concerning these issues.

In remarks prepared for the event, the former President expressed his gratitude towards Noem, calling her "one of the most successful governors in the entire nation." Trump lauded Noem's stance on American values and her tough position on China, while also highlighting her decision to keep South Dakota open during the pandemic.

With this significant endorsement, Trump's campaign for the 2024 presidential race gains even more momentum, backed by a prominent Republican figure. Only time will tell how this alliance shapes the political landscape ahead.
