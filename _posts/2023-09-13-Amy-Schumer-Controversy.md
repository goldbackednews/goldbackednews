The unpredictable landscape of celebrity social media took another twist when comedian Amy Schumer found herself in the midst of a storm after jesting about Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis' support for Danny Masterson, recently convicted of rape.

The incident began when Schumer, attempting to apologize for a post seen as "cyberbullying" towards actress Nicole Kidman, made a sarcastic reference to Kutcher and Kunis' letters of support for Masterson. These letters were sent to a judge prior to Masterson's sentencing hearing.

Amy's apology read, "I want to apologize to all the people I hurt posting a photo of Nicole Kidman and alluding to her being an alien. I will be asking the cast of that '70s show to write letters advocating for my forgiveness." She appended her message with the hashtag "#takingtimetoheal." 

However, this joke did not land well with the online audience. Comments poured in from fans and critics alike, denouncing Schumer for making light of such a grave issue. Reactions varied from accusing Schumer of being "tasteless" to questioning her decision to jest about a sensitive matter.

Adding to the complexity of the situation is the fact that Masterson was recently sentenced to a rigorous 30 years to life in prison, post his conviction on two counts of forcible rape. Kutcher and Kunis' letters were among nearly 50 submitted to the court in support of Masterson. Astonishingly, in Kutcher's letter, he praised Masterson as a "role model" and credited him for keeping him away from drugs.

Both Kutcher and Kunis later took to Instagram, expressing regret for their letters, clarifying that they were not meant to belittle Masterson's victims in any way. "We support victims," Kunis asserted, reiterating their dedication to supporting victims through their philanthropic endeavors.

Masterson's legal journey isn't over yet. His legal team has expressed their intent to appeal the guilty verdict. Shawn Holley, Masterson's attorney, stated, "Mr. Masterson did not commit the crimes for which he has been convicted... we are confident that these convictions will be overturned."

This tangled web of celebrity opinions, legal ramifications, and public sentiment showcases the ever-blurring lines between personal opinions, public images, and the weight of social media in today's age.
