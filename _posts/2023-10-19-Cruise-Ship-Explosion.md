An unsettling explosion on the American Queen Voyages’ Ocean Navigator, a popular cruise ship docked in Maine's Portland Harbor, prompted the immediate evacuation of hundreds aboard. The explosion, originating from the engine room, sent shockwaves throughout the community and the wider cruise industry.

According to local reports, a crew member faced grave injuries following the incident and was rushed to a nearby hospital. This individual suffered serious burns to the arms and hands, as cited by the Daily Mail. In addition to the injured crew member, 128 passengers were hurriedly escorted off the ship. The remainder, 82 in total, were the ship's employees, as confirmed by WGME, a local TV station.

Taking a closer look at the Ocean Navigator, this 286-foot cruise vessel can accommodate 202 people. On that fateful Wednesday, the ship had just positioned itself at the Ocean Gateway Terminal when, around 7:25 a.m., a fire broke out in a generator within the engine room. Thankfully, swift actions by the Portland firefighters and the ship's own crew ensured the flames were doused quickly. Presently, efforts are underway to clear the smoke from the ship. However, the U.S. Coast Guard has stated that passengers will not be permitted to reboard, as reported by WPFO.

The Ocean Navigator, constructed in 2001 and subsequently refurbished in 2019, now faces an extensive investigation to pinpoint the exact cause of the explosion. While the inquiry remains ongoing, American Queen Voyages released a statement addressing the event: "Ocean Navigator encountered a generator fire this morning in Portland, ME. Thankfully, no passengers were harmed. Due to our crew's rapid response, everyone was evacuated safely. One crew member, unfortunately, sustained injuries and is under medical care. The fire has been managed, and we're working closely with the local fire department to gauge the damage. Currently, guests have been accommodated in a local hotel."

American Queen Voyages, headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is recognized for its diverse cruising options. They offer an array of journeys, spanning river cruises, lake cruises, and expansive ocean voyages. Their reach extends to various destinations, including the Southeast, the Great Lakes, Alaska, New England, Canada, Mexico, and even Costa Rica.

With safety at the forefront of concerns, all eyes are now on the investigative results and the measures that will be undertaken to prevent such incidents in the future.
