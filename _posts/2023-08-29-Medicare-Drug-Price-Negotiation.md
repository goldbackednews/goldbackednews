In a move aimed at alleviating the financial burden of health care costs for millions of Americans, President Joe Biden's administration has signaled its intent to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This landmark decision, announced on Tuesday, zeroes in on 10 drugs, including a widely prescribed diabetes medication and the blood thinner Eliquis, in a determined bid to pare down Medicare expenses.

### An Unprecedented Initiative 

Jardiance, a preferred diabetes treatment from Eli Lilly and Co., Amgen’s autoimmune disorder remedy Enbrel, and Novartis's heart failure medication Entresto are among the drugs that the federal government plans to haggle over. Highlighting the significance of this initiative, research from AARP pointed out that Medicare's expenditure on Eliquis alone amounted to a staggering $10 billion in 2020. This particular drug is crucial for treating blood clots and averting stroke risks in patients with a condition known as atrial fibrillation.

Following this pivotal announcement, President Biden is slated to delve deeper into the subject of health care costs in a forthcoming speech from the White House, with Vice President Kamala Harris at his side.

The magnitude of this move's potential impact becomes evident when considering that over 52 million individuals, predominantly those aged 65 or above or those with select grave disabilities or ailments, avail prescription drug coverage via Medicare's Part D program, as documented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Nevertheless, the hurdle of drug affordability remains significant. Research spearheaded by the Commonwealth Fund in 2021 unveiled that roughly 9% of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and above either abstained from obtaining a prescription or missed a dose owing to prohibitive costs.

### New Aims, Old Challenges

Under this new directive, CMS is vested with the authority to hammer out the most equitable peak price for the drugs in question. This could be a lifeline for patients who, despite having coverage, are confronted with hefty out-of-pocket expenses such as high deductibles upon obtaining prescriptions.

At present, pharmacy benefit managers supervising Medicare prescription plans clinch rebates on drug prices. While such rebates might occasionally curtail the premiums that customers remit for coverage, they scarcely impact the out-of-pocket expense at the pharmacy.

However, this groundbreaking initiative doesn't come without its fair share of challenges. Pharmaceutical giants have been bracing for this confrontation, with several already mounting legal challenges against the administration's plan. Among the vocal opponents are notable drugmakers Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, bolstered by a powerful lobbying consortium, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

Despite these obstacles, the overarching goal of the negotiations remains clear, as articulated by Medicare expert Gretchen Jacobson: "to basically make drugs more affordable while also still allowing for profits to be made.”

The road ahead may be fraught with legal battles and industry resistance, but the administration's determination to transform the drug pricing landscape in favor of consumers is palpable.
