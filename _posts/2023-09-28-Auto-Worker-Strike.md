Doug Burgum, the Republican Governor of North Dakota, takes a stand for auto workers during the recent GOP debate, highlighting the ongoing strikes sparked by President Joe Biden's stringent green policies, particularly focusing on electric vehicle (EV) mandates.

### The Strife of Detroit’s Auto Workers
Gov. Burgum passionately voiced the grievances of members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) who are striking against major automotive giants—General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis. He pointed out that the uproar in Detroit isn’t just about labor conditions or wages but fundamentally a protest against Biden’s interference with the capital and free markets.

“Biden’s policies are forcing the production of a particular type of car—we’re particularly subsidizing electric vehicles. This subsidization isn’t just affecting the type of vehicles produced but also where the essential components are sourced,” Burgum asserted during the debate.

### China’s Dominance in EV Production
China presently holds the reins of the EV supply chain, manufacturing critical components vital for EV batteries. Their control spans over significant portions of the world’s lithium, manganese, cobalt, graphite, and nickel, elements essential for the production of EVs. Burgum highlighted that this control extends to nearly every facet of an EV battery’s parts, reflecting China’s dominance in this sector.

“The batteries for these subsidized cars are predominantly sourced from China, which controls 85 percent of the rare-earth minerals. This dominance ensures that EVs sold in the U.S. market are, in one form or another, produced or sourced in China,” stated Burgum.

### Biden’s Green Policies and the Subsequent Fallout
The widespread adoption of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act is facilitating automakers with extensive tax credits for electric vehicles produced in North America, translating to an economic boon for the manufacturers. However, this act is not just reshaping the automotive landscape but is anticipated to obliterate millions of American auto jobs due to the shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles.

“The shift to EVs necessitates two-thirds fewer workers to manufacture a car, and Biden’s policies are precipitating this transformation,” explained Burgum. He emphasized that the strikes are a direct consequence of these policies, which are putting the jobs of millions of auto workers at risk, making it imperative to scrutinize and reassess these green mandates closely.

### Impact on American Workers
The transition to electric vehicles is not just a simple switch in energy sources; it is a radical transformation in the production processes, labor requirements, and supply chain dynamics, with profound implications for American workers, especially those in the automotive sector.

### The Call for Rational Policies
Burgum's remarks underline the necessity for rational and worker-friendly policies that don’t just consider environmental aspects but also evaluate the socio-economic repercussions on the American working class. The implications of these policies necessitate a balanced approach to ensure that the transition to greener technologies doesn’t escalate into widespread social and economic upheaval.

The ongoing strikes and the distress among the American auto workers mirror the pressing need to refine and reconsider policies, balancing ecological concerns with the well-being and prospects of the American workforce.
