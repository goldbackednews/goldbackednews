In the heart of American democracy, former President Donald Trump remains a figure of debate and contention. But recent efforts to block him from the New Hampshire primary ballot have been met with resistance from state GOP leaders, showcasing their commitment to a fair democratic process.

## Upholding the Right to Run

Despite Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire being a known critic of Donald Trump, he, along with other state party officials, has shown no support for the move to prevent Trump from entering the presidential race. This approach emphasizes the importance of upholding democratic values and allowing every eligible candidate a fair chance to compete.

Bryant "Corky" Messner's recent considerations of a lawsuit, should Trump decide to put his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot, has raised eyebrows. Messner questions Trump's eligibility to run for the presidency, citing the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

## GOP's Clear Stance

However, Gov. Sununu's office was quick to distance itself from these efforts. Ben Vihstadt, Sununu's spokesman, made it clear that the governor has no intention of preventing any candidate from participating in the elections. "Providing he follows the same rules as all other candidates, the Governor doesnâ€™t expect ballot access will be a problem for the former president," Vihstadt stated.

There's been chatter about using the 14th Amendment to bar Trump from the ballot since he declared his intention to run again. These discussions have intensified in the wake of Trump's recent legal challenges.

## Party Unity Above All

Despite the whispers and murmurs, the New Hampshire GOP remains firm. State party chairman, Chris Ager, stated that while he respects Messner, he disagrees with him on this particular matter. Ager emphasized the party's commitment to allowing every candidate a fair shot, stating that the party would intervene to ensure a full choice on the ballot if needed.

Separately, John Anthony Castro, a Texas-based attorney running for the GOP presidential nomination, filed a lawsuit aiming to keep Trump off the primary ballot. In response to this, Ager expressed the New Hampshire GOP's determination to stand for the Republican voters' rights in the state.

## Conclusion

As the race for the 2024 presidency heats up, it's heartening to see certain core democratic values upheld. No matter where one stands on the political spectrum, it's crucial to respect the foundational tenets of our democracy, ensuring that every eligible candidate gets a fair chance to present their vision to the American people. In the Granite State, it seems this principle is alive and well.
