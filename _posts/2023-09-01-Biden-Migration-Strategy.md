In what appears to be a political diversion, President Joe Biden's administration is offering what some critics term as a "PR fig leaf" to Democrats in New York amidst the escalating migration crisis. The objective? To mask the mounting voter opposition to their liberal labor migration policies.

Governor Kathy Hochul of New York recently revealed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to dispatch staff to New York City to aid migrants in acquiring work permits. This gesture is touted by the White House as a surge in resources aimed at legally processing thousands of individuals, seeking asylum. However, this plan isn't exclusive to New York. The DHS aims to expand this initiative to other cities swamped by migrant influxes, including Chicago.

This move might enable politicians like Hochul to assert to voters and contributors that migrants aren't mooching off welfare and must earn their keep. Among those collaborating in this strategy include White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Yet, the underlying consequences of such a policy aren't as rosy. The issued work permits not only grant migrants the ability to vie for jobs and housing that working-class Americans target, but they may also depress wages and inflate rental costs nationwide. This could inadvertently exacerbate issues for the already-struggling middle class.

In a telling August poll by the New York Times and Siena College, over half of the political independents in New York perceived international migration as more of a burden than a benefit over the past two decades. Such statistics highlight the broader concerns of ordinary citizens, which the Biden administration seems to gloss over with mere public relations tactics.

An issue that further complicates this scenario is the fact that many economic migrants have sidestepped official procedures to cross the border, thereby avoiding the mandated register and release process. And even if they adhere to this system and subsequently apply for asylum, they must languish for at least half a year before securing a work permit â€” a delay originally instituted to shield American workers.

While there have been proposals in Congress to curtail this waiting period, neither seems poised for approval. Both parties fear that diminishing this timeframe could inadvertently incentivize further illegal border crossings.

The White House does have the option of bestowing "Temporary Protected Status" upon migrants from disaster-stricken regions or even offering "Humanitarian Parole" to more job-seekers at the border. Yet, a significant proportion of these migrants actively seek to dodge such governmental oversight, opting to engage in black-market employment instead.

Governor Hochul, alongside the White House and several business benefactors, seems intent on ensuring these undocumented migrants secure employment and housing, irrespective of the ramifications for American citizens. 

Biden's expansive migration policies have already introduced at least four million workers into the nation's labor market. These additions, although applauded by certain business factions for their potential to suppress labor costs, might be doing more harm than good. Such policies might be exacerbating an array of challenges, from homelessness to the opioid crisis, and inadvertently hindering innovation, stalling wage growth, and deepening socio-economic divides.

In the grander scheme, Biden's approach to the migration crisis might be seen as a temporary bandaid for a festering wound. And as history has shown, such short-sighted solutions rarely bode well in the long run.
