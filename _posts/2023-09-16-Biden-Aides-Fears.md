The political landscape is buzzing with whispers of a potential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2024. Amongst the most anxious are Biden's aides, who are reportedly feeling the heat from recent polls suggesting a neck-to-neck race between the two former contenders.

**The Gravity of Trump's Threat**
CNN recently reported that the prospect of Trump returning as the Republican candidate is causing "existential stress" within the Biden camp. While Trump's known controversial nature might make him seem like an easier opponent to some, Biden's aides are gravely concerned. They fear that any slip-ups by the Biden campaign, or unanticipated missteps by Biden himself, could potentially see Trump return to the White House, a scenario they view as detrimental to American democracy.

**Liberal Media's Pressure on Biden**
The pressure isn't solely stemming from the possibility of a Trump comeback. Liberal media outlets and respected columnists have lately turned their scrutiny onto the Biden administration. A recent piece by David Ignatius from The Washington Post called on Biden and Vice President Harris to reconsider their 2024 run, expressing concerns that their campaign could jeopardize the progress made since Trump's defeat in the previous election.

**Campaign Woes and Media Scrutiny**
To add to the worries, Biden's campaign is experiencing a noticeable absence of notable names and big checkbooks from the Democratic donor community. Aides are pointing fingers at the media, accusing them of amplifying concerns about Biden's age and the controversies surrounding his son, Hunter Biden.

Recent polls don't help alleviate these anxieties. A significant portion of the American populace, including many from the Democratic base, have voiced concerns about Biden's age, given he would be 86 at the end of a second term.

**Facing the Future**
As the potential for a historic rematch between Biden and Trump becomes increasingly plausible, the Biden camp must navigate their internal apprehensions and the external pressures of the media, polls, and public opinion. The stage is set for a tumultuous run-up to 2024, with the shadows of the past election looming large.
