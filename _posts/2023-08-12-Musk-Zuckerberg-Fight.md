In an announcement that has electrified the tech world and beyond, Elon Musk revealed this Friday that his much-discussed cage fight with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg might be held in Italy. Italian authorities have acknowledged the ongoing discussions around this spectacle, aiming to transform it into a "great charity event."

Through a post on his X social media platform (formerly Twitter), Musk shared his communication with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the Minister of Culture about finalizing a spectacular venue. In response, Zuckerberg took to his Threads social network, posting an image of himself showcasing his jiujitsu skills in his backyard. Clearly a fan of martial arts, Zuckerberg voiced his enthusiasm, stating, "I've been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me."

The rivalry has been on the cards since Zuckerberg's Meta released its Twitter competitor, Threads, this past July. This development further ignited their competitive spirits, which was already simmering from previous exchanges.

However, while Musk seems eager to host the event at Rome's iconic Colosseum, Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano was quick to clarify that the historic UNESCO World Heritage site would not be the battleground.

The stakes are high, with Sangiuliano confirming that the charity event could raise "many millions of euros" aimed to benefit two major Italian pediatric hospitals. Emphasizing the event's importance, he mentioned its potential to globally advertise Italy's rich history and cultural heritage.

Musk also tweeted sentiments of respect for Italy's legacy, asserting that the funds raised will support veterans. He indicated that the match would be supervised by foundations he and Zuckerberg lead, rather than the renowned UFC.

Despite this, UFC chief Dana White expressed interest in the showdown, speculating during Mike Tyson's podcast that it could gross a staggering $1 billion in revenue.

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, expressed a desire to collaborate with professional entities such as the UFC to spotlight top-tier athletes in the martial arts realm.

Amidst this whirlwind of announcements and speculations, Musk revealed a potential health obstacle. Alluding to a "problem with my right shoulder blade," he mentioned a possible "minor surgery" that might sideline him for a few months. However, he assured fans that his existing titanium plate, connecting two vertebrae, would not impede his participation.

With no concrete date set for this epic face-off, the world waits with bated breath to witness what could be the most legendary battle between two tech giants in history.
