In a momentous decision that could reshape immigration policy, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen once again declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program illegal. This marks the second time Judge Hanen has made such a ruling, reinforcing the belief that the program might soon see its day in the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a comprehensive 40-page ruling released on Wednesday, Judge Hanen stated that there existed "no material differences" between the iteration of DACA he deemed illegal in 2021 and the amendments introduced by the Biden administration, as cited by The New York Times.

The DACA program, conceived via an executive order by former President Barack Obama in 2012, had been legally contested by Texas and an additional eight states. Their contention lay in the belief that the program circumvented established congressional lawmaking processes, causing the states tangible harm. These grievances ultimately led Judge Hanen to label the program unconstitutional back in 2021 and once more this Wednesday.

The individuals protected under the DACA program, colloquially known as "Dreamers", are safeguarded from potential deportation and can reside within the U.S. borders provided they satisfy specific criteria. These prerequisites, as outlined by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, include age restrictions, maintenance of a clean criminal record, and specific immigration status as of June 15, 2012.

As of March, NBC DFW highlighted that there were approximately 578,680 individuals enrolled in the DACA program.

Despite the gravity of Wednesday's ruling, there's a silver lining. The Biden administration is poised to contest the judgment at the U.S. Supreme Court. Furthermore, Judge Hanen specified that the government retains the authority to process those applicants who secured their initial DACA status before his groundbreaking ruling on July 16, 2021. The catch? The Department of Homeland Security is prohibited from accepting new applications.

In a bid to clarify his stance, Judge Hanen emphasized, "To be clear, neither this supplemental order of injunction nor the memorandum and order that accompanies it requires DHS or the Department of Justice to take any immigration, deportation, or criminal action against any DACA recipient, applicant, or any other individual."

The Hill recounted Judge Hanenâ€™s awareness of the "predicament" DACA participants find themselves embroiled within due to the ongoing legal tussles. Yet, he firmly opined that the remedy to such dilemmas rests with Congress. He emphasized, "While sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients and their families, this court has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time... The solution for these deficiencies lies with the legislature, not the executive or judicial branches."
