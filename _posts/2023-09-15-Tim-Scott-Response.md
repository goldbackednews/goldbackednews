In a recent appearance on FNC’s “Hannity,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, provided a strong response to comments made on ABC’s "The View."

Sunny Hostin, a co-host on "The View," drew parallels between Scott and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, specifically noting the potential for Scott to marry a white woman, akin to Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas's wife. This sparked a discussion between Sean Hannity and Scott about the implications and motivations behind such comments.

Addressing Hannity's query on whether such remarks played the race card, Scott didn’t hold back. “Absolutely, Sean. The Democrat Party and the progressive left they are stuck in Jim Crow 1920s and ’30s. What they do not want is a black man who thinks for himself,” declared Scott. He further expressed his perspective that while a black individual in America has the liberty to be anything, being conservative seems to be an exception in the eyes of many. Scott labeled Hostin’s comments as "radical" and "disgusting."

In a poignant conclusion, Scott emphasized his belief that narratives like his, showcasing the journey of black conservatives, are intentionally overlooked as they challenge the narratives espoused by the radical left. “They don’t want my life story to be told because it difficulties results the lies of the radical left,” Scott added. Expressing his disappointment, he remarked, “I can’t think of anything more disgusting and more disheartening to watch the Democrat Party descend down into the 1920s. Unbelievable.”

The episode underscores the ongoing political and cultural debates that continue to permeate the nation’s discourse as the 2024 election season heats up.
