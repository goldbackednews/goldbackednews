In a recent development, President Biden has come under intense scrutiny for his seemingly detached response to the tragic Maui wildfires in Hawaii. His curt reply of "no comment" to reporters on the escalating death toll from the disaster has drawn significant backlash.

During a short retreat at Rehoboth beach, Biden was approached by reporters seeking his remarks on the Maui calamity. Bloomberg's Justin Sink, after confirming via video, reported that the president's sole response was "no comment," which many perceived as indifference to a crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 100 people.

MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, known for his usual defense of the White House, pointed out that such behavior from Biden would adversely affect his reputation, referring to it as "unforced errors." Another noted journalist, Yashar Ali, minced no words, describing Biden's response as "absolutely terrible."

The Washington Examiner's Byron York stressed, "It seems like the president should have something to say about that." Similarly, CNN political commentator Scott Jennings sarcastically alluded to Biden's well-known empathetic persona, expressing disappointment in his response.

Despite the scathing criticisms, The White House highlighted Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's appreciative comments about the federal government's swift response to the disaster. Green expressed gratitude on MSNBC, praising the President for quickly declaring a state of emergency. Furthermore, White House officials confirmed that Biden had been updated on the Maui situation by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.

In support, Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono acknowledged President Biden's prompt action on CNN's "State of the Union." She said, "I really thank the President for declaring an emergency declaration within hours of being asked to do that by the state of Hawaii."

However, on-ground sentiments differ. Cole Millington, a Maui resident, expressed discontent with the government's response, emphasizing the dire need for more federal support. "We should have the Navy here. We should have the Coast Guard here. We should have helicopters here," he urged.

The unfolding scenario presents a juxtaposition of contrasting views, with the President's response (or lack thereof) to the Hawaii wildfires placing him at the epicenter of a political storm.
