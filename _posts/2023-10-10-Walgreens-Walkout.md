Walgreens, a major pharmacy chain in the U.S., is facing a significant disruption in its operations as hundreds of employees across numerous stores stage walkouts. The primary reason behind this wave of protests? Alarming working conditions that employees claim jeopardize both their well-being and the safety of customers.

According to inside sources who spoke with CNN, over 500 of Walgreens' approximately 9,000 locations — a staggering 5.5 percent — have shown interest in participating in the strike, scheduled from Monday to Wednesday. As a result, many pharmacies in states like Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, and Oregon have temporarily ceased operations.

Stores that remain operational are grappling with acute staff shortages as a large fraction of workers abstain from showing up. Some Walgreens outlets are striving to keep their drive-through services running, while others contemplate shutting their doors temporarily.

So, what's driving these pharmacy workers to take such drastic measures? The grievances listed are manifold: an uptick in responsibilities like vaccinations, coupled with confronting hostile customers and dealing with various forms of harassment. Amanda Applegate, interim executive director of the Kansas Pharmacists Association, described the plight of the pharmacists, likening them to ATMs, where the emphasis on volume trumps quality of service. 

The grassroots nature of this protest is evident. Without a central union leader orchestrating the demonstrations, the movement gains traction through word-of-mouth, social media, and even fliers. Under the hashtag "#OperationSpotlight," pharmacy employees voice their concerns and frustrations.

One striking visual that resonates with the sentiment of these workers is a placard outside a Walgreens store that reads: "Dear Public, There is NOT a Shortage of Pharmacists, Technicians. There is a shortage of pharmacy employees willing to work in conditions which put their lives and your life in danger!!”

Despite the outcry and visible impact on store operations, Walgreens' corporate response seems underplayed. Although they acknowledge "some activity," the company’s statement to CNN emphasizes that the "vast majority of pharmacies are operating across the country."

This wave of protests and the spotlight on working conditions come amidst another challenge retail stores face: increasing thefts. CVS, another pharmaceutical retail giant, announced plans to close around 900 of its stores by 2024 due to a spike in shoplifting incidents. Similarly, multiple CVS stores in Kansas City, Missouri, have had to close their doors for weeks owing to employee walkouts, echoing concerns about a "dangerous environment."

In a country that heavily relies on retail pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS for their healthcare and medicinal needs, these walkouts are a wakeup call. The message from employees is clear: prioritize their safety and well-being for better services and a safer community.
