In what some might call a controversial move, President Joe Biden has proposed Hampton Dellinger, a past colleague of Hunter Biden, for the prestigious role of White House Special Counsel. This nomination comes at a critical juncture, as the Office of the Special Counsel currently oversees federal whistleblower protections and the investigation of executive branch corruption, including the Justice Department's inquiries into Hunter Biden.

Dellinger shares more than just a professional connection with Hunter; both are Yale Law School graduates. They worked together at Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm where Hunter Biden notably sought representation for Burisma Holdings. For those unaware, Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, made payments of $83,000 per month to Hunter for his position on their board. There are allegations, backed by an FBI FD-1023 file and seconded by IRS whistleblower Joseph Ziegler, of bribes amounting to $5 million each for both Joe and Hunter Biden from a Burisma executive.

It remains a matter of speculation whether Dellinger provided legal services for Burisma.

The implications of this nomination are weighty. If Dellinger secures the role, he would have jurisdiction over the investigations concerning any retaliation claims by the DOJ against two IRS whistleblowers who argued that the DOJ's inquiry into Hunter Biden was politically influenced.

Recent developments had seen Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) calling on the current Special Counsel, Henry Kerner, to look into alleged meddling. They voiced concerns, stating, “Two IRS whistleblowers and their team faced removal from the Hunter Biden case, seemingly as a retaliation for their legal interactions with Congress.”

Adding fuel to the fire, Hunter Biden's legal representative, Abbe Lowell, targeted these IRS whistleblowers a few months ago, hinting at possible legal action by the DOJ for releasing Hunter Biden's tax details to the House Ways and Means Committee. This incident led to Hunter suing the IRS in September, claiming improper information disclosure by these whistleblowers.

In an era where whistleblowing is deemed essential, IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel emphasizes that IRS employees should be the first to highlight alarming issues. He envisions a proactive environment, encouraging a "see something, say something" approach.

While President Biden's nomination of Dellinger is under intense scrutiny given the intricate web of connections and ongoing investigations, the broader implication is clear: the forthcoming days in U.S. politics are set to be tumultuous and heavily watched.
