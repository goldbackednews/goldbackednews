In a groundbreaking move aimed at bolstering transparency, the Pentagon declared on Thursday the inauguration of a new website managed by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This online portal promises public access to declassified documents, videos, and images pertaining to UFOs, referred to by the government as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).

At a media briefing, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder emphasized the website's role in presenting data such as videos and photographs related to resolved UAP instances, all of which are declassified and approved for public disclosure.

> "The department is committed to transparency with the American people on AAROâ€™s work on UAPs," Ryder stated. 

Heralding it as a "one-stop" destination for all available public information, Ryder conveyed that the AARO will consistently refresh the site, appending its latest discoveries once deemed suitable for public consumption. UFO enthusiasts and the curious public can dive into this repository of knowledge at [aaro.mil](http://aaro.mil).

This landmark announcement comes on the heels of a demand by six congressional members for a deeper dive into supposed covert programs focusing on UFO wreckage retrieval and the reverse engineering of their technology. David Grusch, an outspoken UFO whistleblower, subtly referred to these initiatives during a sworn statement in the House Oversight Committee hearing on July 26. However, Grusch refrained from in-depth revelations during this public hearing, citing an ongoing whistleblower retaliation lawsuit against him.

One of the more shocking revelations during this hearing was Grusch's claim that the government has been in possession of UFO tech and "biologics" of extraterrestrial origins since the 1930s. Furthermore, he insisted that he was privy to exact storage locations for these items and expressed his willingness to share specifics in a classified environment.

The aforementioned hearing wasn't limited to Grusch's testimony. It featured first-person accounts from military pilots, including David Fravor, who claimed interactions with UAPs during flight missions. Specifically, Fravor, a retired squad leader with 18 years of naval piloting under his belt, recounted his encounter with the now-infamous "Tic Tac UFO" during a 2004 training mission. He stressed the superior capabilities of the object, emphasizing that it surpassed any existing or foreseeable technology.

In an era brimming with speculation and conspiracy theories about extraterrestrial existence and government cover-ups, the Pentagon's endeavor to bring transparency is a monumental step toward keeping the public informed and dispelling rumors.
