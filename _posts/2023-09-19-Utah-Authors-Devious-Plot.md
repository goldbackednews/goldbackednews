A shocking revelation has emerged in the case of Kouri Richins, a Utah-based children's book author and mother of three. Already in the public eye for allegedly poisoning her husband with a lethal cocktail, she's now accused of attempting to fabricate evidence by urging her brother to provide a false testimony.

## A Twist in the Tale

Summit County officials stumbled upon a six-page letter in Richins' jail cell that was addressed to her mother, Lisa Darden. Within the letter, Richins claims her attorney, Skye Lazaro, was seeking to establish a connection linking the drugs that poisoned her husband to Mexico. She then urged her brother, Ronald "Ronney" Darden, to provide testimony about Eric Richins' supposed trips to Mexico to purchase painkillers and the lethal drug, fentanyl.

In an almost flippant tone, she wrote about the need to connect the drugs to Mexico, concluding with the statement "Upon information and belief LOL."

However, prosecutors firmly state there is no existing connection between Eric Richins, Mexico, and the fatal fentanyl dose.

## A Motive for Murder

It's believed that Kouri's motive was financial gain. Records indicate she took out four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins, her husband, amounting to over $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On the first day of 2022, months before the tragic event, she changed the beneficiary of Eric's $2 million life insurance policy to herself, without his consent. Notably, Eric had revised his will prior to his death, removing Kouri and naming his sister as the primary beneficiary.

Family members expressed concerns about Kouri's intentions, recalling Eric's fears for his life, especially after he believed she tried to poison him twice before.

The couple's relationship was also strained due to financial disagreements. Kouri had aspirations of purchasing and flipping a $2 million mansion for profit, while Eric viewed it as an overly costly venture.

## A Disturbing Aftermath

Post Eric's untimely demise, Kouri penned a children's book titled "Are You With Me?" dealing with the theme of death. Available for $14.99 on Amazon, the book claims to assist children in navigating the complexities of loss.

Given the recent discoveries, it appears there's much more to this case than meets the eye. As investigations continue, the tragic tale of a family torn apart by greed and deception unfolds.
