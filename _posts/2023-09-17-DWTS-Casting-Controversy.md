"Dancing with the Stars" is a show many people love. It’s all about celebrities pairing up with pro dancers to show off their moves. But recently, one choice of celebrity has many people, including former DWTS pro dancer Sharna Burgess, feeling a bit upset.

## Speaking Out Loud

Sharna Burgess used her podcast, "Old-ish", to share her thoughts. She was really surprised when she found out that Adrian Peterson, a famous football player, was joining the new season of "Dancing with the Stars."

"Why?" you might ask.

Well, in 2014, Peterson was in big trouble. He got charged with child abuse. He had used a switch (a thin tree branch) to spank his young son, who was only four years old at that time. The child had lots of cuts and bruises. Later, in 2018, Peterson said in an interview that he still uses a belt to punish his son.

For Burgess, this was really hard to hear. She said, "The man has been charged with child abuse... and that is just devastating for me." She even mentioned that if she were still on the show and got paired up with Peterson, she would just leave.

## Other Troubles

Earlier this year, Peterson had another problem. He was arrested at an airport. There was a report that he and his wife, Ashley, had a big argument on a plane. However, later, the couple shared happy news: they were expecting their third child.

Many fans of "Dancing with the Stars" are not happy with Peterson joining the show. When they found out he'd be dancing with pro dancer Britt Stewart, lots of them went online to share their feelings. Britt’s Instagram account got many negative comments.

## Why All This Matters

This story shows us how choices made by TV shows can stir feelings and debates. Some people think that Peterson should get a second chance. Others feel that his past actions should keep him off the show. It's a reminder that the world of entertainment is not just about fun and games; it can also spark important discussions about right and wrong.
