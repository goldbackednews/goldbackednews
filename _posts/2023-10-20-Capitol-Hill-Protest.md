WASHINGTON â€“ Capitol Hill was the epicenter of fervor and passion as protesters from all over the U.S. gathered, demanding an end to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Their cries for a cease-fire culminated in the arrest of hundreds.

These demonstrators, many of whom identified as Jewish, bore shirts with a powerful message: "Jews say ceasefire now!" Their strong commitment to peace was evident when Liv, a participant from the activist group **Jewish Voice for Peace**, proclaimed, "We were raised saying 'Never again.' That time is now!"

During the demonstration, approximately 300 protesters were taken into custody, with the U.S. Capitol Police confirming charges of illegal protest inside a House office building for some. Three individuals also faced assault on a police officer charges. But for many demonstrators, this was a necessary act of civil disobedience. Louisa, one of the protesters, emphasized the importance of their message reaching both Congress and President Biden. She fervently expressed the need for U.S. intervention to facilitate a cease-fire and prevent further loss of life.

The magnitude of the demonstration was palpable. Among the sea of protesters were rabbis, children of Holocaust survivors, and supporters from far and wide. One member even traveled from Kansas City after the demonstration was planned merely three days in advance. The objective was clear: convey a strong message to the U.S. leadership that they must act. Michael, another participant, voiced a call for the U.S. to use its significant influence to de-escalate the situation, suggesting a stop in financial support and troop stationing.

The demonstration wasn't without its critics. The Anti-Defamation League's D.C. chapter voiced concerns, asserting that while these groups claim representation, they do not embody the majority Jewish sentiment. The ADL D.C. Regional Director, Meredith R. Weisel, strongly indicated that challenging Israel's right to exist, as these anti-Zionist groups do, equates to antisemitism. However, many protesters countered this, emphasizing the diverse perspectives within the Jewish community and their empathy for the Palestinian cause.

The echoes of the protest weren't limited to Capitol Hill. Activists from the group **IfNotNow** reported similar acts of civil disobedience in Boston, targeting the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, pressing her to advocate for a cease-fire.

With emotions running high, this demonstration highlights the complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the passionate voices on all sides seeking resolution and peace.
