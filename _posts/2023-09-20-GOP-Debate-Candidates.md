As the Republican primaries heat up, seven GOP candidates have apparently secured their spots for the second presidential debate, slated for September 27. However, all eyes are on former President Donald Trump, who's choosing to skip the event in favor of addressing striking autoworkers in Michigan.

**Who's In and Who's Out?**

The debate, hosted at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, will likely include a mix of familiar faces and emerging leaders:

- Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL)
- Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy
- Former Gov. Nikki Haley (R-SC)
- Former Vice President Mike Pence
- Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC)
- Former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ)

According to CBS News politics reporter Aaron Navarro, these candidates have likely satisfied the Republican National Committeeâ€™s updated polling and donor prerequisites. However, Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) and former Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR), both participants in the first debate, seem to be trailing behind in their bid to join the next round.

**The Debate Requirements**

Candidates looking to step onto the debate stage need to hit certain benchmarks:

- Secure three percent or more in two national polls
- Alternatively, obtain at least three percent in one national poll and three percent in two of the initial four early voting states

All polls considered must be dated August 1 or later. Additionally, hopefuls must also rally a total of 50,000 unique donors, a 10,000 donor increase from the first debate's requirements.

**Trump's Counter-Move**

While these candidates are gearing up for a lively debate, Trump is charting his own course. Sources have confirmed that during the debate, Trump plans to engage with members of the United Auto Workers in Detroit, Michigan, who are currently striking against major automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. The New York Times has indicated that Trump is set to give a "prime-time speech" to these union members.

This isn't the first time Trump has opted for a counter-programming strategy. During the first debate, he rivaled the event with a gripping 45-minute interview with Tucker Carlson, which quickly went viral.

With the third debate expected in Miami, Florida, in November, it'll be intriguing to see how the political strategies evolve and what surprises lie ahead in this gripping election season.
