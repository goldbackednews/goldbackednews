Scholastic Inc., a well-known children’s publisher, recently found itself at the center of controversy following its decision to segregate books with racial, disability, and LGBTQ+ themes at school book fairs. This move, intended as a response to the growing number of content restrictions in various states, has sparked a significant backlash and raised questions about the role of education in today’s politically charged climate.

The publisher created a separate package of books, titled “Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice,” giving schools the option to include these titles in their book fairs. While some have criticized this move as exclusionary, it is crucial to examine the broader context and consider the importance of upholding traditional values in education.

In an era where ‘woke’ ideologies are increasingly prevalent, infiltrating various aspects of society including education, it is essential to stand firm in our commitment to preserve the integrity of our educational content. The term 'woke' has come to represent a set of beliefs that emphasize political correctness and social justice, often at the expense of free speech and diverse perspectives.

Scholastic’s decision to segregate these books, while controversial, can also be seen as a response to the concerns of parents and educators who wish to protect their children from indoctrination and ensure that they receive a balanced education. The inclusion of books that promote particular ideologies should not be done at the expense of academic rigor and intellectual diversity.

In their statement, Scholastic acknowledged the backlash and announced the discontinuation of the “Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice” collection starting in January. However, they failed to provide a clear strategy for the future, leaving many wondering about their commitment to upholding educational standards and resisting the pressures of political correctness.

It is vital for educators, parents, and students to remain engaged and vigilant in the face of challenges to our educational system. We must strive to provide our children with an education that is grounded in tradition, promotes critical thinking, and prepares them to navigate the complexities of the world.

Publishers like Scholastic play a significant role in shaping the minds of future generations, and they must be held accountable for their decisions. It is our responsibility to ensure that our education system remains a bastion of learning, free from the influence of political agendas and focused on the intellectual development of all students.

The controversy surrounding Scholastic’s policy is a reminder of the importance of standing firm in our values and advocating for an education system that upholds the principles of intellectual freedom, academic excellence, and traditional values.
