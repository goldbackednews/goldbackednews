In a recent post on Truth Social, former President Donald Trump pulled no punches when he highlighted the noticeably empty seats at President Joe Biden's address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Trump’s assertion was clear: under Biden's administration, America seems to have lost a measure of international respect.

**Biden Speaks to Half-Filled Hall**

"Biden just finished his surrender ('speech') at the United Nations, and nobody, despite all we give them, showed up. No respect for America any longer!" Trump's message on Truth Social stated. 

This observation was further underscored by the conspicuous absence of several world leaders. Notably missing were French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. With these key players absent, the U.S. was the only member of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in attendance.

Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, expressed his views to CBS News, noting the significance of the absence of Sunak and Macron.

**Biden's Appeal Amidst a Hollowed Audience**

In his address, President Biden made passionate pleas to those present, emphasizing the importance of supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion. "Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence," Biden remarked, urging the world to act.

In stark contrast, Trump has offered a decisive approach, stating his intention to resolve the Ukraine crisis within 24 hours should he be re-elected in 2024.

**Questionable Choices on Iran**

Adding to the list of criticisms, Biden's recent dealings with Iran have come under severe scrutiny. A prisoner swap agreement, which allowed Iran to tap into $6 billion of previously frozen oil revenue, has been slammed by Republicans, including Trump.

The former President expressed his incredulity on Truth Social, questioning the wisdom of releasing funds while securing a mere trade of detainees. "How much of a kickback does Crooked Joe Biden get? Does anyone realize how much money 6 Billion Dollars is?" Trump asked pointedly.

The White House countered by emphasizing that the funds would be strictly monitored and used only for humanitarian purposes. However, this response hasn't silenced critics, including Trump, who see this move as a reflection of a broader theme of perceived weakness in Biden's administration.

With Biden's recent actions raising eyebrows both at home and on the international stage, one can't help but ponder if America's position on the world stage is truly waning.
