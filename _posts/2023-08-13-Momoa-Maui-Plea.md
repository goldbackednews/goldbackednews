### Jason Momoa's Heartfelt Appeal: Stay Away from Maui

In the tragic aftermath of the devastating wildfires that engulfed Maui, taking the lives of at least 80 islanders, Jason Momoa, the Hawaiian-born star known for roles in "Aquaman" and "Game of Thrones," has taken to social media with a pressing message for potential tourists.

> “Maui is not the place to have your vacation right now. DO NOT TRAVEL TO MAUI,” Momoa passionately declared on his Instagram. 

Born in Honolulu and having a deep connection to his Hawaiian roots, Momoa's plea seems to echo with genuine concern and love for his homeland.

#### A Heartfelt Warning 

His message extends beyond the realm of simple travel advisories. Momoa implores tourists not to rationalize their trips to the island during this period of deep distress.

> “Do not convince yourself that your presence is needed on an island that is suffering this deeply," he cautioned.

In these trying times, the actor also expressed his gratitude towards the generous hearts that have come forward to aid the island community.

> "Mahalo to everyone who has donated and shown aloha to the community in this time of need," he wrote, directing followers to check his Instagram Stories and the accounts of @kakoo_haleakala, @mauirapidresponse, and @hawaiinewsnow for more updates and information.

### Lahaina - A City in Peril

As the world watches, the situation remains grim in the city of Lahaina. With firefighters persistently battling sporadic flare-ups, the city is under a blockade. Officials have raised concerns about the hazardous environment, cautioning residents about toxic particles emanating from still-smoldering areas. Due to these threats, residents are currently barred from returning to assess the extensive damage.

As Maui continues its battle against nature's fury and begins its journey to recovery, voices like Momoa's are pivotal in shedding light on the situation and galvanizing much-needed global support.
