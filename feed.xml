&lt;p&gt;The distressing news was confirmed by the Austin (Texas) Police Department, which attended a welfare check on Tuesday, leading to the tragic discovery of Hardwick’s lifeless body. While the circumstances surrounding his death are still shrouded in mystery, the Austin police have categorically stated that it isn’t a homicide case. Further details pertaining to the cause will be unveiled once the Travis County Medical Examiner finalizes their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardwick’s role as Dale Gribble began in 1997 with the show’s premiere episode and lasted until its conclusion in 2010, spanning an impressive 259 episodes. His outstanding contribution to “King of the Hill” earned him an Emmy Award in 1999, followed by nominations in 2001 and 2002. The animated masterpiece was the brainchild of creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, with a cast ensemble including talents like Judge himself, Kathy Najimy, Stephen Root, and Pamela Adlon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, fans rejoiced upon learning about a forthcoming revival of “King of the Hill,” with Hardwick’s involvement confirmed. Craig Erwich, the executive at the helm of ABC Entertainment, Hulu, and Disney Branded Television Streaming Originals, expressed enthusiasm about resuming the show’s narrative to reflect on our contemporary world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond his notable voice acting career, Hardwick was also a gifted stand-up comedian, making a mark in the comedy circuits during the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/08/25/2023-08-12-Ian-Watkins-Assault/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-08-25T14:27:50-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-25T14:27:50-04:00</updated><id>/2023/08/25/2023-08-12-Ian-Watkins-Assault</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/08/25/2023-08-12-Ian-Watkins-Assault/">&lt;p&gt;Ian Watkins, the controversial former lead singer of the rock band Lostprophets, faced a brutal assault inside HMP Wakefield, where he’s currently serving a 29-year sentence for grave child sex crimes. According to sources, Watkins is in critical condition following the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports from the Mirror shed light on the gruesome nature of the assault. Allegedly, Watkins was accosted and held hostage by three inmates, subjected to hours of physical abuse, and eventually stabbed multiple times. Officers discovered the critically injured singer only hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Watkins was held for a lengthy period by the prisoners and endured a severe beating before the stabbing. The entire ordeal is under investigation,” conveyed the officials from HMP Wakefield. Fortunately, in a subsequent update from law enforcement, it was clarified that Watkins’ injuries, while severe, were not life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lostprophets, active from the late ’90s to the early 2000s, witnessed their downfall following the shocking revelations of Watkins’ depravities. In 2013, he faced charges for thirteen appalling sex offenses against children, which included the attempted rape of a one-year-old girl. The case revealed that Watkins administered drugs to children, plotting their sexual abuse, and even filmed some of his heinous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronted with overwhelming evidence, Watkins pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape, sex with minors, and the possession of disturbing explicit content. His conviction in December 2013 led to the disintegration of the Lostprophets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jo Mjadzelics, one of Watkins’ former partners, expressed her shock at the recent attack, stating to the Mirror, “It’s surprising that such a brutal attack took so long, especially in a prison like Wakefield.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader implications of the attack on Watkins underline the volatile dynamics within prison systems, especially for individuals convicted of particularly reviled crimes. The repercussions of his crimes, it seems, continue to echo both for Watkins and for those who were once associated with him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Elle King’s Triumphant Transformation - From Postpartum Struggles to Newfound Strength</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/08/25/Elle-King-Weight-Loss-Journey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Elle King’s Triumphant Transformation - From Postpartum Struggles to Newfound Strength" /><published>2023-08-25T14:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-25T14:11:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/08/25/Elle-King-Weight-Loss-Journey</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/08/25/Elle-King-Weight-Loss-Journey/">&lt;p&gt;Country star Elle King’s recent Instagram post not only stunned fans with her remarkable weight loss but also resonated with many for its candid and vulnerable portrayal of her battle with postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Darkness to Light:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After welcoming her son, Lucky, in September 2021, King’s weight scaled to 284 pounds. Fast forward to 2023, and the singer has undergone a noticeable physical transformation. However, she’s quick to clarify: it wasn’t a product of any medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From pregnancy in 2021 to now in 2023, it’s been a journey,” she shared on Instagram. “Weight loss doesn’t happen overnight. It’s been an ever-evolving process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing Postpartum Depression:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King delved deeper into her struggles during and post-pregnancy. “I fell deep into depression during my pregnancy. The intensity of postpartum depression was overwhelming,” she recounted. Feeling entrapped in her own body, King’s passion – her singing – also suffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path to Healing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daughter to comedian Rob Schneider, King decided to tackle her health issues head-on. “I began slow, incorporating metabolic workouts and light cardio. Over time, my body, voice, and spirit felt rejuvenated,” she stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her journey wasn’t solo. Partnering with personal trainer @pauldominic_, King underscored the importance of self-motivation. “Find what you love - music, cycling, swimming. It started as a desire to lose weight but transformed into a holistic wellness approach. My mind functions better when my body is active.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Physical Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elle King’s commitment extends beyond the scales. She shared snippets of her skincare routine and behind-the-scenes clips preparing for concerts. But, she firmly declared, “Today, I’m healthy. I’m neither tiny nor huge. Most importantly, I’m not on any weight loss medication.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her motivation also finds roots in her family history, recalling her diabetic grandfather. “I’ve seen him struggle. I’m pre-diabetic with PCOS. But my journey is mine, and I only wish for a long, content life,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Prigozhin, known for his influence and ties with Putin, was reportedly one of the victims in an aircraft explosion that occurred within Russian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking during a meeting with Denis Pushilin, leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic (a separatist state aligning with Russian interests in Ukraine), Putin extended his condolences, saying, “It is always a tragedy.” Without directly addressing international conjectures hinting at Russian government’s involvement in Prigozhin’s demise, he emphasized the significance of Prigozhin’s contributions to combating what he described as the “neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s personal relationship with Prigozhin dates back to the early 1990s. He acknowledged Prigozhin’s complex nature, alluding to both his mistakes and his undeniable talent as a businessman. Prigozhin’s business endeavors spanned not only Russia but also territories in Africa, dealing in oil, gas, and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the magnitude of the situation and its geopolitical implications, the air is rife with speculative theories. While some suspect an assassination orchestrated by Putin, others speculate a fabricated tale of Prigozhin’s death intended for clandestine purposes. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official, highlighted the skepticism around Russian state media’s reporting, suggesting potential disinformation operations at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further adding to the intrigue, the U.S. President Joe Biden, when queried about Prigozhin’s alleged presence on the ill-fated plane, remarked, “Not much happens in Russia that Putin’s not behind. I don’t know enough to know the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of this uncertainty, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy swiftly dispelled notions of Ukraine’s involvement in Prigozhin’s apparent death, cryptically adding, “I think everyone is aware of who is involved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world watches closely, the saga surrounding the plane crash and its high-profile victim promises further twists and turns, with truth being the ultimate casualty in this intricate game of power and politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In an atmosphere charged with uncertainty and speculation, Russian President Vladimir Putin has finally voiced his sentiments on the reported death of the Wagner Group leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in a recent plane crash.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Woke Agenda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney’s decision to be more “woke,” or socially conscious, has been pinpointed by many as a significant contributor to its decline. What was once a cherished escape from reality for families worldwide has now become a hotbed for modern political and societal debates. For many longtime fans, Disney’s pivot to more progressive narratives feels less like genuine evolution and more like a calculated move to appease a vocal minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors in the Decline:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box Office Misfires:&lt;/strong&gt; Movies are no longer the surefire hits they once were. As Disney attempts to integrate contemporary social agendas into its storylines, it seems the magic may have dimmed for a considerable segment of its audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the inclusion of diverse characters and narratives that’s at issue here—it’s the perception that Disney is forcing a particular viewpoint on audiences, overshadowing the primary objective of providing quality entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

Expressing his views on “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Owens championed Trump’s unwavering spirit amidst current political adversities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Significance in Modern Politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting Trump’s significance in the contemporary political landscape, Owens stated that Trump is, in essence, the “middle finger” to the radical left. This sentiment resonates with many conservatives who believe that Trump’s audacious stance often rattles the core of the more extreme left factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Donald Trump’s presence and influence unsettle those who are accustomed to having their way unchallenged,” Owens elaborated. He emphasized that the left, often seen as bullies, is met with formidable resistance in Trump, a factor that exacerbates their antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Call to Unity Among Conservatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing fellow Republicans, Owens urged unity, especially in these turbulent times. Pointing out the gravity of the nation’s political climate, he mentioned that Republicans and conservatives need leaders who genuinely understand and represent the values they uphold. He further added that supporting Trump is paramount in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a pivotal moment in our nation’s history. We need stalwarts who can rally us and fight for the very ideals America was built on,” the congressman stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenging Times Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the outpour of support from conservatives and allies, Trump currently faces legal challenges. Recently, he was booked at the Fulton County Jail on charges related to the 2020 elections. However, this hasn’t deterred the former president or his supporters, showcasing their indomitable spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that several of Trump’s close allies, such as Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, have faced similar situations but remain committed to their shared values and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aged 57, El Amarillo was associated with the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unwavering in the Face of Adversity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move marks a historic event as it’s the first time a former U.S. president has been booked. The charges relate to Trump’s alleged efforts regarding the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. The 13 counts span from violations of the Georgia RICO Act to allegations of conspiracies to commit various offenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth noting that Thursday’s surrender was not his first brush with legal complexities this year. Trump faced similar situations multiple times but remained consistent in adhering to legal protocols, emphasizing his faith in the country’s justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporters Rally, Demonstrating Undying Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As news spread of Trump’s imminent surrender, supporters gathered outside the Fulton County Jail, showcasing a vast sea of loyalty and solidarity. The atmosphere outside the jail was palpable, emphasizing the strong connection between the former president and his loyal base, which has remained steadfast through highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s co-defendants, including renowned figures like Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, followed a similar path, turning themselves in at the jail earlier in the week. The united front displayed by Trump and his close allies stands as a testament to their commitment to face challenges head-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Short Stay and a Future of Possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After flying into Atlanta, Trump’s stay at the jail was brief, lasting about 20 minutes post his surrender. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the legal proceedings progress. However, one thing remains clear – Trump’s determination and the unwavering support of his base will continue to be influential factors in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In an unprecedented event in American history, former President Donald Trump surrendered to the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;Whistleblower David Grusch has made significant claims under oath regarding such secret programs. During a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 26, Grusch suggested that the government has been engaging in such activities for decades. Yet, due to ongoing reprisal cases against him, Grusch refrained from divulging further details in the public hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push for truth intensified as six Congress members, including Reps. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Jared Moskowitz (D-Florida), Anna Paulina Luna (R-Florida), Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), and Andy Ogles (R-Tenn), jointly signed a letter on August 21 to Inspector General Thomas Monheim, seeking answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the controversial UAP hearing, Grusch, a former intelligence officer and Air Force veteran, claimed firsthand knowledge about the existence of UFO technology and “biologics” of “non-human origins” dating back to the 1930s. He attested that he could provide details, albeit in a classified setting. Following the hearing, Grusch’s personal medical records surfaced in a move seen by many as an attempt to discredit his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Coulthart, the reporter who initially covered Grusch’s statements about a concealed UFO-retrieval operation, posted Grusch’s full remarks on Twitter on August 8. This elicited a fervent response from Rep. Burchett, condemning the leak of Grusch’s medical details as a desperate ploy to conceal the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The July 26 hearing also featured testimony from former military pilots, Ryan Graves and David Fravor, who recounted their encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) while airborne. Fravor, a retired Navy pilot, described observing the now-infamous “Tic Tac UFO” during a 2004 training mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concluding a two-hour-long hearing on July 26, Rep. Ogles expressed concerns about the potential national security implications. This concern has led to bipartisan efforts in the Senate to declassify and release UFO-related documents, uniting political adversaries in a quest for truth about these unidentified phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Lawmakers are demanding transparency from the intelligence community about alleged covert operations concerning UFOs - specifically, the retrieval of crashed UFOs and subsequent efforts to reverse-engineer their technology.

In what seemed to be counter-programming to the first Republican primary debate, Trump voiced his most pressing concern: the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Top Concern Amidst Global Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Carlson probed about his prime priority if re-elected, Trump was quick to spotlight the border. “Let’s say number one is a border and taking hundreds of thousands of criminals that have been allowed into our country and getting them out and bringing them back to their country,” he stated. This reveals Trump’s consistent focus on border security, echoing his previous election’s commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multinational Migration Concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump continued to detail the diversity of the migrants, mentioning, “Last month, we had 149 countries represented.” He emphasized the influx from regions some might find surprising, elaborating on the various origins and backgrounds of the immigrants. According to Trump, not only South American prisons but also mental institutions are being emptied out, resulting in a mix of individuals entering the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Promise for a Stronger Border&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting his previous term, Trump proudly stated the achievements on border control, highlighting the construction of nearly 500 miles of wall. Challenging the narratives that downplay his accomplishments, he emphasized, “I built 500 miles.” He also alluded to plans for an additional 200-mile extension that was halted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his concluding remarks, the former president laid out a promise familiar to his previous election campaigns, with a renewed vigor: “The first thing I would do would be, I would seal up the border good and tight, except for people that want to come in legally,” assuring Americans of his undeterred focus on border security.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Amidst the whirlwind of political events, former President Donald Trump made headlines once again in an exclusive interview with Tucker Carlson.
