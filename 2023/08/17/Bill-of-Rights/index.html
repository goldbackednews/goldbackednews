<p>Former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee, voiced his concerns on Newsmax, stating that President Joe Biden’s Justice Department is overreaching its bounds and infringing upon the Bill of Rights. This comes in the wake of a controversial police raid on a small Kansas newspaper, which has raised significant concerns about potential abuses of power at both federal and local levels.</p>

<p>Huckabee emphasized, “Once you have the Justice Department of the federal level trampling all over people’s civil rights, it starts trickling down.” He believes that such behavior from top-tier law enforcement agencies emboldens smaller departments, leading them to believe they can sidestep citizens’ rights enshrined in the Constitution.</p>

<p>Drawing parallels with the treatment meted out to Donald Trump and his supporters by the Justice Department, Huckabee expressed concerns about the preservation of core American principles, such as the rights to privacy, due process, and the presumption of innocence.</p>

<p>The central issue that ignited this debate was the Kansas police department’s raid on a local newspaper’s premises, which resulted in the seizure of computers, cellphones, and other equipment. Tragically, the stress from the raid is alleged to have caused the death of the owner’s 98-year-old mother.</p>

<p>Echoing the sentiments of host Carl Higbie, Huckabee stated that this incident should alarm not just the residents of Kansas, but all Americans. “It’s about your front door. It’s about your home,” he said, emphasizing that the raid was less about a singular event and more about a larger pattern of intimidation aimed at conservatives.</p>

<p>The former Governor concluded by urging Americans to educate themselves on their constitutional rights. “We have a lot of people in this country that never passed ninth-grade civics,” he lamented, drawing attention to the lack of knowledge about basic rights and the nation’s history.</p>

<p>In these turbulent times, Huckabee’s call to action serves as a poignant reminder of the necessity to remain vigilant and informed, ensuring that the pillars of democracy remain untarnished.</p>
