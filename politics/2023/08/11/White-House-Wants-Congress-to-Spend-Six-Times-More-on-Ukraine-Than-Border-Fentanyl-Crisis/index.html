  <p>According to a recent emergency spending request submitted to Congress, the Biden administration is seeking a significantly larger allocation for Ukraine compared to the border and fentanyl crisis affecting the U.S.</p>

<p>The emergency spending request, directed to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, outlines Biden’s proposition for $24 billion in aid to Ukraine. This amount is divided into two parts: $13 billion aimed at defense-related expenditures and $11 billion meant for economic and humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>In contrast, the President’s request for tackling the border and immigration issues, along with the fentanyl crisis, stands at $4 billion. Cumulatively, the spending request comes to an estimated $40 billion.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in December, before the Republican Party gained control of the House of Representatives, Congress greenlit $48 billion in funds for Ukraine.</p>

<p>However, the recent request for additional funds could face resistance in the House. Speaker McCarthy has indicated he won’t present an extra Ukraine funding bill for voting. This reluctance stems from concerns among several conservatives who are wary of offering more financial assistance to Ukraine without stricter accountability measures.</p>

<p>The funding dynamics are further complicated by the fact that last month, 70 House Republicans endorsed an amendment in the annual defense bill to stop all monetary aid to Ukraine. This motion, however, did not pass.</p>

<p>The spending request’s timing is also crucial, given the ongoing illegal border crossings at the Texas-Mexico border. With facilities either reaching or about to reach their maximum capacity for immigrant accommodation, the situation is increasingly dire.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, sources from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection have reported approximately 19,400 migrants under the custody of the Border Patrol across the country.</p>
