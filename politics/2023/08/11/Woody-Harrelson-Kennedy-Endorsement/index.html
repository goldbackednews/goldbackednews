  <p>Woody Harrelson, renowned actor and industry maverick, has gone against the Hollywood grain to back Democratic presidential hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Such a move is striking given Hollywood’s implicit expectation of allegiance to the party’s main line, which can make or break careers.</p>

<p>Sporting a “Kennedy 2024” cap, Harrelson was seen alongside Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s spouse, Cheryl Hines, an actress from ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm.’ Hines later took to her Instagram to share the snap, adding the caption, “Great seeing you Woody.”</p>

<p>Not one to shy away from expressing his views, Harrelson has openly critiqued the pharmaceutical sector and has been an ardent opponent of COVID vaccine mandates. His sentiments on the topic were evident during his recent hosting gig on NBC’s ‘Saturday Night Live,’ where he lambasted pharmaceutical companies, likening them to “drug cartels” and accusing them of influencing politicians and the media narrative around COVID vaccinations and lockdowns.</p>

<p>Harrelson’s recent comments to Esquire reveal his broader discomfort with both liberal and conservative ideologies, stating, “There are things that the liberals do that I think, What fucking idiots. And then there’s also conservative ideology that strikes me as odd. I consider myself, really, an anarchist.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the center of Harrelson’s endorsement, has been forthright in his critiques of Big Pharma and has aired vaccine-related skepticism. As he steps up to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, Kennedy has found himself the target of major news outlets — many beholden to pharmaceutical advertisers — aiming to tarnish his reputation.</p>

<p>Harrelson isn’t alone in the celebrity circle showing support for Kennedy, Jr. Notable figures like Alicia Silverstone and ‘SNL’ veteran Rob Schneider have also declared their endorsements.</p>
