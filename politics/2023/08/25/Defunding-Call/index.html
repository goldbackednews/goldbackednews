  <p>In an impassioned outcry against what he views as a biased pursuit of justice against former President Donald Trump, GOP Georgia State Sen. Colton Moore has made a call to action. His demand? An emergency special session of the Georgia state Legislature with the goal to halt state tax dollars flowing to the office of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.</p>

<p><strong>Funding Controversies</strong></p>

<p>According to Moore’s conversation with Newsmax, while DA Fani Willis serves only one of Georgia’s 159 counties, her office benefits from taxpayer funds spanning the entire state. This arrangement has stoked the flames of contention for Moore, especially given recent legal actions targeting Trump and his allies.</p>

<p>However, Moore’s battle uphill becomes evident when considering the response from his fellow Republicans. Just one, among the 32 GOP members in the 56-seat Senate, has signaled any form of support for such a special session.</p>

<p>Expressing his frustrations, Moore lamented, “It’s hard to soar like an eagle when you are dealing with a bunch of buzzards.” By this, he pointed to the reluctance of his peers to convene and debate over the redirection of funds away from Willis’ office. Instead, many have shown a preference to let a forthcoming Prosecutorial Oversight Commission handle any alleged mismanagement of the Trump case by Willis.</p>

<p>The freshman senator displayed his exasperation, commenting, “So they would rather trust unelected bureaucrats than the elected representatives of the people of Georgia.”</p>

<p><strong>Governor Kemp Under Fire</strong></p>

<p>But Moore’s discontent isn’t limited to his immediate colleagues. He reserved some sharp criticisms for Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he referred to as a “disgrace to this situation.” Moore’s bone of contention lies in Kemp’s alleged lack of action when others, such as Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams, contested election results. Yet, when Trump exercised his First Amendment rights to voice his beliefs about the 2020 Georgia elections, criminal charges followed.</p>

<p>Moore’s fervent belief is that “Fani Willis is a domestic threat,” and he adamantly feels that taxes originating outside Fulton County should not support her prosecutorial endeavors. He passionately concluded, “I would rather be tarred and feathered if I allow Fani Willis to go on as she has.”</p>
