  <p>In a rapid response to former Vice President Mike Pence’s statements about post-election pressures, Donald Trump has countered the narrative, emphasizing his belief in the “truth” of the events that transpired after the 2020 Presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump’s retort comes in the wake of Pence’s explosive revelations, where the former Vice President detailed pressures from Trump to overturn the election results. In his statement, Trump asserted that Pence had the “absolute right” to send back votes that were perceived as fraudulent, and he believed that there was a potential to “correct” the Electoral College outcome.</p>

<p>The former president’s comments underscore the longstanding contention surrounding the 2020 election. Trump, along with many of his supporters, has remained adamant about perceived irregularities and the need for further investigation into the results. This contrast with Pence’s views has reignited the debate over what truly transpired during the tumultuous post-election period.</p>

<p>While Trump acknowledged the various accomplishments he shared with Pence during their tenure, he stressed that they have diverging views on the events that followed the 2020 election. The back-and-forth between two of the most influential figures in the Republican party serves to highlight the existing divides within the GOP, as members grapple with the party’s direction and legacy.</p>

<p>The discourse between Trump and Pence continues to draw significant attention, raising questions about the future of the party, the truth behind the post-election period, and the potential political trajectories of both leaders.</p>
