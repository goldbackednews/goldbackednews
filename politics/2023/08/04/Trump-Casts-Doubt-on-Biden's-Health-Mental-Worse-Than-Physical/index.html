  </div><article class="article-content">
  <p>In an exclusive video from Breitbart News, former President Donald Trump has raised concerns about President Biden’s health, specifically targeting his mental state. Trump claimed that Biden’s “mental health is worse than his physical health.”</p>

<p>Ever since Biden took office, his health and particularly his mental acuity have been subjects of speculation, fueled at times by his verbal gaffes and missteps. Trump, who has consistently questioned Biden’s fitness for office, did not shy away from voicing his opinion on this matter in the interview.</p>

<p>The former President’s comments come amidst a time of high political tension, with the Biden administration grappling with several crises on multiple fronts. Critics, including Trump, have blamed Biden’s alleged lack of mental sharpness for what they see as the administration’s failures.</p>

<p>However, supporters of Biden argue that such personal attacks detract from substantive policy debate and only serve to further divide an already polarized political landscape.</p>

<p>Despite the swirling controversies, Biden has repeatedly assured the public of his physical and mental fitness to serve as President. As debates around his health continue to make headlines, the resilience of these assurances will be tested in the coming months.</p>
