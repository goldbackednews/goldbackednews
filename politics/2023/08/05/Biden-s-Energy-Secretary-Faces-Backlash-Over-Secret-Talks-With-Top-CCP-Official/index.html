  <p>Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has come under fire for holding undisclosed discussions with a top official from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The revelation of these secret talks, brought to light by Fox News Digital, has prompted a wave of criticism and raised questions about transparency in the Biden administration.</p>

<p>Granholm’s undisclosed dialogue with the Chinese official stands at odds with the Biden administration’s pledge of transparency and integrity in their dealings. Critics have pointed out that the lack of transparency in these discussions could potentially undermine the administration’s commitment to an open and accountable government.</p>

<p>China’s role in global energy markets and its environmental practices have been subjects of international concern. Therefore, any undisclosed discussions involving a high-ranking US official and a senior CCP member naturally raise eyebrows.</p>

<p>Calls for clarity and accountability have been made in the wake of these revelations. These secret talks underscore the ongoing tension in US-China relations and the pressing need for transparency in international diplomatic communications.</p>

<p>As the controversy unfolds, the Biden administration is likely to face increasing pressure to provide a clear explanation for these undisclosed discussions and ensure such practices do not recur.</p>
