  <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) of the prominent “Squad,” has ratcheted up pressure on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, demanding the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate his alleged financial ties to a prominent Republican megadonor.</p>

<h2 id="the-call-for-investigation">The Call for Investigation</h2>

<p>In a strongly-worded letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Ocasio-Cortez, backed by four of her Democratic allies, expressed concern over Justice Thomas’s “consistent failure” to disclose significant gifts from Harlan Crow, a Texas-based real estate developer, and other influential figures, spanning almost two decades.</p>

<p>The letter draws heavily from an April investigation by ProPublica, detailing how Thomas enjoyed lavish holidays aboard Crow’s private jet and yacht, among other perks, without reporting these financial benefits on his disclosure forms. Such a lack of transparency, Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues argue, constitutes a defiance of federal law.</p>

<p>The allegations don’t stop there. Justice Thomas is also accused of refraining from recusing himself from cases that posed a potential conflict of interest due to his personal relationships.</p>

<h2 id="thomass-defense">Thomas’s Defense</h2>

<p>Following the initial ProPublica report in April, Justice Thomas felt compelled to issue a public statement. He emphasized the close personal relationship he shares with Harlan and Kathy Crow, spanning over 25 years, and defended the trips he took with them. According to Thomas, upon his induction to the Supreme Court, he sought guidance on such matters and was informed that hospitality from close friends without cases before the Court didn’t require reporting.</p>

<p>However, Ocasio-Cortez remains undeterred, sharing her concerns on social media and stating, “No one is above the law.” Highlighting Justice Thomas’s alleged failure to report millions in gifts over two decades, she called on the DOJ to investigate any violations of the Ethics of Government Act of 1978.</p>

<h2 id="wider-implications">Wider Implications</h2>

<p>While the accusations and the calls for an investigation continue to make headlines, it’s important to underscore the potential implications this could have on the Supreme Court and the political landscape. Any established misconduct on the part of a sitting Supreme Court Justice could have profound ramifications, not just for the individual in question, but for the judiciary as a whole. As the story unfolds, it will be crucial to distinguish between personal relationships and professional misconduct, ensuring justice and transparency at every turn.</p>
