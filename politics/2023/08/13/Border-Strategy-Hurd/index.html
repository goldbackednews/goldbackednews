  <p>2024 presidential candidate Will Hurd steps into the limelight with a radical strategy for the U.S. southern border. Drawing parallels between cartels and terrorist organizations, the former congressman calls for a paradigm shift in how the U.S. perceives and addresses border security and drug smuggling.</p>

<h2 id="targeting-cartels-like-al-qaeda">Targeting Cartels like al Qaeda</h2>

<p>Hurd’s firsthand experience as a representative of a district covering the U.S.-Mexico border has shaped his perspective on border security. Expressing his concerns, Hurd said, “Politicians love to talk about the border crisis, but their inaction on both sides of the aisle speaks louder than their sound bites.”</p>

<p>Central to his strategy is the proposal to treat cartels, human smugglers, and drug traffickers as terrorist entities similar to al Qaeda. Leveraging his experience from his time in the Middle East, Hurd stated, “We should be hunting them at our borders using the full capabilities of the intelligence community to dismantle their networks in Mexico and the Northern Triangle.”</p>

<h2 id="the-fentanyl-crisis">The Fentanyl Crisis</h2>

<p>The surge in illicit fentanyl production, primarily in Mexico, has led to an opioid epidemic in the U.S., resulting in the tragic loss of tens of thousands of American lives each year. Recognizing the gravity of the issue, Hurd emphasized the need to treat smuggling of such potent drugs akin to weapons of mass destruction. Hurd’s alarm at the sharp increase in fentanyl seizures by the CBP is evident, and he underscores the need to ramp up penalties for those involved in its illicit trade.</p>

<h2 id="modernizing-border-security">Modernizing Border Security</h2>

<p>Acknowledging the unique challenges each mile of the border presents, Hurd champions the use of modern technology to ensure security. He outlines a comprehensive plan encompassing enhanced security scans, infrastructure upgrades at current points of entry, and creation of new entry points to reduce congestion. Additionally, he stresses the importance of state and local law enforcement partnerships, bolstered by federal grant programs such as Operation Stonegarden.</p>

<h2 id="addressing-the-root-causes">Addressing the Root Causes</h2>

<p>To curtail the influx of migrants at the source, Hurd’s strategy includes directing foreign aid to address violence, economic disparities, and poverty in countries migrants predominantly hail from. He believes in proactively tackling challenges in these nations, asserting, “It’s a fraction of the cost to solve problems there before they show up here.”</p>

<h2 id="gop-and-the-border-where-do-others-stand">GOP and the Border: Where Do Others Stand?</h2>

<p>Hurd’s strategy release aligns with a trend among Republican presidential contenders to prioritize border security. Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley have each articulated their visions for the border, emphasizing its centrality in the 2024 election narrative.</p>

<p>As the U.S. gears up for the presidential race, candidates like Hurd are setting a clear and assertive tone on border security, ensuring it remains a pivotal issue on the campaign trail.</p>
