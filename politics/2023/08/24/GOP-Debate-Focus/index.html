  <p>In the run-up to what promises to be a pivotal debate in the 2024 presidential race, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is setting a clear tone for GOP candidates: unity over infighting.</p>

<p><strong>A Clear Directive from the Chairwoman</strong></p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s debate in Milwaukee, McDaniel emphatically stressed the goal of the evening. The debate is “the beginning of the general election,” she explained, and while tensions might naturally rise between candidates vying for the nomination, the collective focus should be on one primary target: incumbent President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Hosting this debate is Fox News, which interestingly will also be the site for the 2024 Republican National Convention next summer. This only amplifies the importance of the event and its potential impact on the party’s trajectory moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>A Star-Studded Line-Up</strong></p>

<p>Front and center of the debate stage will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, reflecting his strong polling numbers. Accompanying him will be a range of formidable figures from the GOP, including former VP Mike Pence, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and others. But, notably absent is GOP front-runner, former President Trump, which McDaniel didn’t shy away from mentioning, expressing her wish for him to be on the stage.</p>

<p><strong>Key Issues on the Horizon</strong></p>

<p>McDaniel hopes that the evening will see candidates not just introduce themselves but also delve into pressing issues that have been affecting Americans. Concerns like inflation, education, border security, and crime should be at the forefront, she said. With President Biden’s tenure marked by certain contentious decisions, the GOP seeks to offer viable alternatives and solutions.</p>

<p><strong>The Absentees and Looking Ahead</strong></p>

<p>While the debate stage will feature a line-up of the top GOP contenders, not all made the cut for this event. However, McDaniel was quick to ensure that they are not forgotten. Acknowledging the selection criteria might not have favored everyone, she emphasized the upcoming opportunities for these candidates, cheekily adding that any of them would be “better than Joe Biden.”</p>

<p>McDaniel summed up the evening’s ethos effectively by saying, “Let’s keep our eye on the prize.” As the GOP aims to regain the White House, this debate might just provide a glimpse into the party’s next potential leader.</p>
