  <p>In a new twist to the ongoing political landscape, a hypothetical three-way race for the White House sees former President Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden and Green Party hopeful Cornell West, as unveiled in a national Emerson College poll.</p>

<p>The recently released poll indicates that 42% of registered voters lean toward Trump, while Biden lags behind by a mere percentage point at 41%. Cornell West garners 5% of the votes, with the remaining 13% of the respondents still uncertain about their choice. When the matchup is limited to Trump vs. Biden, the results are neck-and-neck at 44%, accounting for rounding, leaving 12% of the respondents up for grabs.</p>

<p>In an unexpected move, Emerson College, which boasts a stellar record on the pollster platform FiveThirtyEight, also simulated a three-way contest introducing pop icon Taylor Swift into the mix. The outcome is riveting — Trump’s loyal base remains unfazed at 42%, but Swift’s entry snatches support away from Biden, pushing him down to 39%. Swift herself emerges stronger than West with an 8% vote share. Spencer Kimball, Emerson College’s executive director of polling, interprets this result as evidence of Biden’s fragile support base, susceptible to third-party interventions, such as that from West.</p>

<p>Support for Trump remains robust even in the Republican presidential primary, where he towers with a 56% endorsement. Conversely, Former Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) witnesses a sharp decline, plummeting 11 percentage points since June 20. He now stands at par with the rising entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both at 10%. Ramaswamy’s growth is notable, surging 8 points since June.</p>

<p>The shift in the political winds is evident, with a significant portion of DeSantis supporters now rallying behind Ramaswamy. The latter has notably grown popular among Republican voters with postgraduate qualifications. This shift sees DeSantis’s support dwindling from 38% in June to a mere 14% this month. In contrast, Ramaswamy and Trump receive 17% and 32% of the postgraduate vote, respectively.</p>

<p>Trailing behind in the GOP primary are former Vice President Mike Pence and former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) at 3%, followed by former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) at 2%. Conservative radio host Larry Elder and former Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) linger at the bottom with a 1% share each, with a little over 10% still undecided.</p>

<p>It is evident that as the political chessboard evolves, allegiances shift and new players emerge, making the race to the White House an ever-evolving contest.</p>
