  <p>This week Vice President Kamala Harris played down the importance of approval ratings while also claiming polls show her having “great approval ratings.”</p>

<p>In a Monday interview on ABC, Harris was asked is she thinks “race and gender” are to blame with reports that she has “the lowest approval rating of any vice president.”</p>

<p>Harris responded “”Well, there are polls that also say I have great approval ratings. I think the point that has to be made is that there are attempts to create distractions away from the accomplishments of our administration.</p>

<p>We’ve created over 13 million jobs since we’ve been in office. Joe Biden and I have been responsible for 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in the United States, not to mention what we have done to restore America’s integrity on the international stage.”</p>

<p>Harris was also asked in her ABC interview about a statement by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) about launching an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden and his family.</p>

<p>“I don’t really have much to say about, again, the kind of the — the cinema and the grand gestures that are political games,” Harris responded.</p>

<p>Recent Fox News, Monmouth University, and Legler polls show VP Harris having a negative approval rating. RealClearPolitics shows Harris’ average job approval rating as 40.7% approval, 52.7% disapproval. FiveThirtyEight’s polling average showed Harris with an average rating of 40.2% approval, 51.2% disapproval as of July 23.</p>
