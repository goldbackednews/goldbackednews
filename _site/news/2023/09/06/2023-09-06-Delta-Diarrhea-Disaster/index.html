  <p>Ever been in a situation where your stomach lets out a monstrous growl, signaling the imminent approach of a bathroom emergency? Now, imagine that while cruising at 30,000 feet with no escape. One passenger on a Delta flight to Barcelona can attest to this misadventure, proving once and for all that the phrase “shit happens” is not just a metaphor!</p>

<p><strong>To Barcelona, and… Back?</strong>
Just two hours into its eight-hour transatlantic journey, the Delta flight was forced into a U-turn back to Atlanta. Why, you ask? A diarrhea disaster of epic proportions. As per the official announcement from the cockpit, “This is a biohazard issue.” Well, that’s one way to make a splash on an international flight!</p>

<p>After already enduring a two-hour delay before take-off, this Delta flight couldn’t seem to catch a break. A word of advice? Maybe it’s time to rethink the in-flight menu.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Flies High on The News</strong>
As expected, the story quickly took off on the internet, with one Reddit post showcasing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight strip for Flight DL194 – the infamous diarrhea flight. To no one’s surprise, the plane required a thorough scrub-down before embarking on its doo-doo-free journey to Spain once more.</p>

<p>What remained a mystery, however, was whether the “culprit” was aboard the plane for its second attempt. One can only hope that they packed a change of clothes… and maybe some Pepto-Bismol.</p>

<p><strong>Delta’s “Crap-tastic” Week</strong>
To add to the stink of the situation, this messy incident came right on the heels of another Delta hiccup. Just three days prior, extreme turbulence on a Delta flight from Milan to Atlanta sent 11 passengers to the hospital. Quite the roller-coaster (or should we say, toilet-bowl swirl?) week for Delta!</p>

<p>Delta, ever the professionals, addressed the “doo-doo” incident with an official statement: “Our teams worked as quickly and safely as possible to thoroughly clean the airplane and get our customers to their final destination.” They also expressed their sincere apologies for the “delay and inconvenience to their travel plans.”</p>

<p>And to the brave passenger at the center of this incident? Next time, maybe opt for the train. Less air time, and more… restroom options!</p>
