  <p>In a chilling reminder of the potential consequences of liberal policies, Madison – Wisconsin’s progressive capital – witnessed a brutal assault on a female student from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, sparking widespread concerns regarding city safety.</p>

<p><strong>De-funding the Police: A Recipe for Disaster?</strong>
The unsettling attack occurred shortly after the Badgers football team’s victory, leaving the victim with life-threatening injuries. A mere stone’s throw away from Lake Monona, the attack occurred during the early morning hours at the intersection of South Bedford and West Wilson streets. As the victim fought for her life, one couldn’t help but ponder the repercussions of Madison’s decision to slash police funds in 2020. In a move heralded by many left-leaning activists, Madison reduced the police budget by $2 million, as reported by the city’s weekly newspaper, the Capital Times.</p>

<p>The decision, which came in the wake of protests against alleged police brutality, has now left many questioning the Democrats’ approach to community safety. It seems ironic that a city which purportedly championed progressive ideals has now had to increase police patrols in the aftermath of such a heinous act.</p>

<p><strong>The Cry for Safety</strong>
The victim’s ordeal paints a grim picture – abducted off the sidewalk and subjected to unimaginable cruelty. The fact that this took place in a college town, where young minds are expected to pursue their dreams in safety, adds to the tragedy. Police continue their hunt for the perpetrators, urging residents to share any security footage that could provide valuable leads.</p>

<p>But the haunting question remains. Could Madison’s slide into crime have been avoided if the Democrats had adopted a more balanced approach, rather than bowing to pressure and drastically reducing the police budget? The incident calls into sharp focus the wisdom of defunding the police – a move many conservatives argue leaves communities vulnerable and potentially, in harm’s way.</p>

<p>Reflecting on this incident, one can’t help but remember a post from a concerned young woman on Reddit last year, questioning the safety of walking alone late at night in Madison. The top reply, a simple “No,” now seems prophetic.</p>

<p>As Madison grapples with the consequences of its policies, residents are now urged to remain vigilant, avoid walking alone at night, and always stay aware of their surroundings. This incident stands as a testament to the potential dangers of embracing radical reforms without fully considering the potential ramifications for community safety.</p>
