  <p>While high-speed pursuits often make for thrilling movie scenes, real-life chases can have dire consequences - especially when mistakes are made. Arkansas recently witnessed such an incident when a state trooper mistakenly targeted the wrong vehicle.</p>

<p>On a regular Sunday evening on Interstate 40, an Arkansas State Trooper was in hot pursuit of two vehicles reportedly speeding over 100 mph. One of these was a white sedan. In the midst of this chase, Trooper Cpl. Thomas Hubbard, possibly overwhelmed by the speed and intensity, misidentified a completely unrelated white sedan as the suspect’s car.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Hubbard executed a PIT (precision immobilization technique) maneuver on the innocent vehicle. For those unfamiliar, a PIT maneuver is a tactic used by police to force a fleeing car to lose control and stop. This involves a controlled hit by the police vehicle to the side near a rear wheel of the pursued vehicle.</p>

<p>The unsuspecting white sedan, taken off guard, was sent spiraling to the shoulder of the interstate. Dashcam footage vividly captured this entire sequence: the rapid chase, the sedan flashing its brakes, and the subsequent collision.</p>

<p>But what about the occupants of the car? Miraculously, both the driver and the passenger emerged from the crash unscathed. They both declined medical treatment, demonstrating the resilience humans sometimes show in the face of sudden adversity.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the incident has led to swift action. Hubbard has since submitted his retirement and remains off duty. The Arkansas State Police initiated an immediate internal review.</p>

<p>Yet, this isn’t the first time the Arkansas State Police have found themselves under scrutiny for PIT maneuvers. Back in 2021, a woman took legal action against another trooper who “negligently performed” a PIT maneuver, causing her car to overturn at 60 mph. Further investigations by local news revealed that between January 2017 and December 2020, the technique was used a staggering 306 times.</p>

<p>But with such a powerful tactic comes grave responsibility. The Washington Post reported that since 2016, at least 30 people have lost their lives due to PIT maneuvers. Eighteen of these were for minor traffic violations, such as speeding.</p>

<p>In the wake of such statistics and recent incidents, it begs the question: Is it time for a thorough review and possible revision of this pursuit technique?</p>
