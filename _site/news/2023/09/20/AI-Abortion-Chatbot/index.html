  <p>In a tech-meets-healthcare development, a new AI chatbot named “Charley, The Abortion Chatbot” is designed to guide pregnant women and teens towards abortion services. Developed by Cecile Richards and Tom Subak, two former officials from Planned Parenthood, the chatbot aims to offer private and precise information about abortion, but not without its share of criticisms.</p>

<p>Upon visiting the National Women’s Health Network website, users are greeted by Charley saying, “Hi, my name’s Charley. I can help you get an abortion. Let’s get started.” The platform ensures user privacy, requesting only the date of the user’s last menstrual cycle and their state of residence. In its guidance, it covers topics like nearest abortion providers, how minors can seek an abortion without parental consent, and details about mail-order abortion drugs.</p>

<p>However, not everyone views Charley as a helpful tool. E.V. Osment, the vice president of SBA Pro-Life America, expressed concerns to the Washington Examiner, stating that such platforms could endanger lives and potentially promote illegal activities. A run-through of Charley by the Examiner revealed that it provided out-of-state options with fewer restrictions for users based in Virginia. For Mississippi users, the chatbot even suggested leaving the country or heading to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where passports aren’t needed.</p>

<p>Co-founders Richards and Subak envision Charley being integrated into various medical and abortion clinic websites across the nation. Nicole Cushman, the content manager for Charley, shed light on their motivation: “Our research showed that people were turning primarily to Google for information about abortion options in the post-Roe landscape and that it was very challenging for abortion seekers to connect to available options.”</p>

<p>The rise of Charley underscores a growing intersection of technology and healthcare, with the ongoing debate around abortion only intensifying the scrutiny of such platforms. As with many tools of this nature, the line between empowerment and controversy remains thin.</p>
