  <p>The American automobile industry, a cornerstone of U.S. manufacturing, is undergoing a sea change. With the rapid shift towards green energy, particularly electric vehicles (EVs), there’s a growing discord between auto workers and the Democratic establishment.</p>

<p>These workers, many of whom are represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, feel increasingly alienated. According to former UAW President Bob King, the sentiment is clear: “UAW members feel abandoned by the Democratic Party.” His remarks come as the party continues to support what some describe as job-killing free trade and the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA, despite its benign title, is funneling billions from taxpayers to major auto companies and their top tiers.</p>

<p>Further exacerbating the discontent, Biden’s IRA is providing automakers with considerable tax credits for producing electric vehicles within North America. However, this public investment in transitioning from traditional combustion engines to EVs threatens to sideline millions of American auto jobs.</p>

<p>UAW President Shawn Fain is vocal about the financial imbalance resulting from such policies. His apprehension isn’t without merit – the transition to EVs could jeopardize the livelihoods of 20% of powertrain workers in major auto companies. When discussing the potential fallout, Fain highlighted the stark reality: the transition could cause wages to halve from an average of $32 to $16 per hour.</p>

<p>Recent insights from a UAW report underscore the depth of this wage decline. It pointed to the General Motors and LG’s EV battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, as a case in point. While workers at GM’s predecessor plant earned around $30 an hour, their counterparts at the new EV battery plant started with a wage of $16.50, with the prospect of a modest increase to $20 an hour after seven long years. That’s a 45% wage cut for the hard-working individuals of Lordstown.</p>

<p>The UAW, recognizing the gravity of the situation, has already successfully negotiated for wage hikes at the Lordstown plant. But, they’re gearing up for larger battles. There are warnings of potential strikes if auto giants don’t address workers’ demands, especially when considering the ballooning salaries of corporate executives.</p>

<p>Fain underscores the disparity, “The Big Three CEOs saw their pay increase by 40 percent over the last four years, while our pay only went up by 6 percent.” These figures are even more staggering when juxtaposed with the earnings of General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who in 2022 pocketed almost $29 million – 362 times the median paycheck of an average GM employee.</p>

<p>Historically, the gap between executive and employee pay was far narrower. Data from the Economic Policy Institute indicates that in 1965, company executives earned about 20 times their average employee’s paycheck, a figure that has skyrocketed to 399 times in recent years.</p>

<p>Fain’s message is unambiguous: policies, especially those like Biden’s IRA, cannot perpetuate this widening wage chasm. With billions of taxpayer dollars funding the EV transition, the workforce’s interests should be paramount. As Fain concludes, “workers cannot continue to be left behind in that equation.”</p>
