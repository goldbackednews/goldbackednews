  <p>In a shocking turn of events at Dulles Center Mall in Virginia, a YouTube prank went horribly wrong when Alan Colie, a DoorDash delivery driver, shot prankster Tanner Cook in the chest. Despite being acquitted of malicious wounding, Colie remains incarcerated, facing a lesser gun charge.</p>

<h2 id="a-prank-turns-serious">A Prank Turns Serious</h2>
<p>Tanner Cook, a 21-year-old YouTube content creator known as “Classified Goons,” attempted to pull a prank on Colie on April 2. Cook, who earns approximately $2,000 to $3,000 a month from his videos, typically follows people around in public places and acts bizarrely. However, this prank escalated quickly when he confronted Colie at the Dulles Center Mall near Washington, D.C.</p>

<h2 id="the-confrontation">The Confrontation</h2>
<p>Cook blasted a phrase in Colie’s face and followed him persistently, leading Colie to pull out a gun and shoot him in the chest in self-defense. Cook survived and shared the video of the shooting’s aftermath with his 55,000 YouTube followers under the title, “I Got Shot!”</p>

<p>Colie pleaded not guilty, arguing that the shooting was in self-defense, and jurors agreed to an extent, acquitting him of the most severe charges, including aggravated malicious wounding and malicious shooting inside an occupied building.</p>

<h2 id="legal-tangle">Legal Tangle</h2>
<p>Despite the acquittal on serious charges, Colie was found guilty of using a firearm during the commission of a felony, leaving him behind bars. Colie’s lawyers are moving against this, claiming that the conviction is inconsistent with Virginia law, especially considering the jurors’ acknowledgment of Colie acting without malice and in self-defense. He is due back in court on Oct. 19 for a hearing on this issue.</p>

<h2 id="pranks-and-consequences">Pranks and Consequences</h2>
<p>This incident raises questions about the consequences of pranks and whether the quest for views and followers is pushing content creators too far, causing irreversible harm and life-changing consequences. Cook, who continues to create videos, confessed he had no idea his prank had scared or angered Colie to the extent it did, highlighting the lack of foresight and the potential dangers involved in these public pranks.</p>

<p>The incident serves as a stern reminder that pranks can spiral out of control and have severe repercussions, impacting lives permanently. It calls for responsible content creation and an awareness of the potential harm seemingly innocent pranks can cause.</p>
