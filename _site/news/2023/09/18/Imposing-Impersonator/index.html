  <p>In a startling incident, a man was detained at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in Los Angeles. Why? He was impersonating a U.S. Marshal, complete with shoulder holsters holding loaded pistols and spare ammo.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Police Department identified this man as 44-year-old Adrian Paul Aispuro. Shortly after the incident, Kennedy expressed his gratitude on X, which was once known as Twitter. He thanked the security guards for their fast action.</p>

<p>Kennedy wrote, “I’m very grateful that alert and fast-acting protectors from Gavin de Becker and Associates (GDBA) spotted and detained an armed man who attempted to approach me at my Hispanic Heritage speech at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles tonight.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, the impersonator had not just any badge, but a U.S. Marshal badge. He introduced himself as part of Kennedy’s security detail. Thankfully, the GDBA team was on their toes. They detained him till the LAPD could arrive and make an arrest.</p>

<p>Kennedy, who is challenging President Biden, also mentioned he has yet to get protection from the Secret Service. He said, “I’m still hoping President Biden will grant me Secret Service protection. I am the first presidential candidate in history to whom the White House has denied a request for protection.”</p>

<p>This denial comes even though, back in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was tragically shot and killed in LA, not far from where this recent event took place. Kennedy Jr.’s uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, was also assassinated in 1963.</p>

<p>Photos of Aispuro from the event have been circulating online. He was caught wearing a black shirt stamped with “Emergency Medical Services.” As of now, he remains in custody with a bail set at $35,000.</p>

<p>This incident is a sobering reminder of the potential threats political figures face, even in modern-day campaigns. It underscores the importance of security and protection for those in the public eye.</p>
