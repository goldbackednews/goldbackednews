  <p>A recent revelation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training at Kaiser Permanente has stirred considerable controversy. A distressed hospital employee leaked the content, which suggests children as young as 3 or 4 can identify as transgender.</p>

<p>The anonymous whistleblower reportedly expressed “horror” upon encountering the DEI material, according to a report by Libs of TikTok. The disputed content includes a video in which children discuss their recognition of being transgender at ages 3 and 4. The video underscores that “Many transgender people have ALWAYS known their true gender.”</p>

<p>A featured child, Rose, narrated her journey, saying, “I was born a boy, but I always knew that I was a girl.” Her father further illustrated her self-awareness by recounting Rose’s heartfelt letters to Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, wherein she wished to become a girl.</p>

<p>Amidst the escalating debate, Kaiser Permanente clarified its stance, asserting the training didn’t advocate for medical interventions in such young children. Their statement affirmed, “While the video touches upon how kids perceive their gender identity, it doesn’t allude to any adolescent transgender care or treatments. Kaiser Permanente doesn’t administer hormone treatments or gender-affirming surgeries to 3 and 4-year-olds.”</p>

<p>However, these clarifications have not appeased all, as medical professionals increasingly promote and explore non-traditional ideas around gender ideology. A notable instance includes Diane Ehrensaft, a director at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, introducing notions such as children identifying as “Tootsie Roll Pops,” “Gender Smoothies,” and “Gender Minotaurs.” Ehrensaft describes these identities as facets of the unfolding “Gender Revolution.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lauren T. Roth, a pediatrician, emphasized the importance of parents adopting gender ideology “at birth or even before,” pointing out that traditional gender colors like pink and blue impose undue “expectations” on infants.</p>

<p>Controversially, military physician David Klein proposed the potential of sex changes alleviating psychotic symptoms. However, his claims received no endorsement from the Pentagon. Klein’s perspective underlined that psychiatric conditions could “melt away” once treatments like hormones and surgeries were “optimized.”</p>

<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, representing the organization “Do No Harm,” expressed skepticism about minors undergoing hormone treatments and puberty suppressants, stating that existing medical literature doesn’t advocate for such practices as a norm.</p>

<p>As the debate ensues, medical professionals, parents, and activists remain divided on the issue, fueling an ongoing discourse on childhood gender identity and medical interventions.</p>
