  <p>In a fresh endeavor to address a series of air and rail safety concerns, the House Oversight Committee announced its probe into the U.S. Transportation Department’s response to these issues on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The oversight initiative, as explained in a letter addressed to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, mainly revolves around near-miss aviation occurrences and train derailments. The committee, predominantly Republicans, underscored the urgent need for “a briefing, documents, and communications related to the department’s efforts to investigate and remediate these issues.” Their primary focus is safeguarding the American populace from such threats.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Transportation Department has maintained silence and not yet commented on the investigation.</p>

<p>Committee chair James Comer, accompanied by fellow Republicans, made a pointed reference to a series of unresolved safety suggestions by the department’s Office of Inspector General. The missive states, “These safety failures have eroded the public’s confidence in air and rail safety and necessitates thorough investigation.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has taken on seven investigations concerning near-miss runway events since January alone. Earlier in March, Buttigieg had expressed his concerns over these aviation close calls, terming them as “deeply troubling.”</p>

<p>A particularly alarming episode unfolded on Aug. 11, as a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 almost collided with a Cessna Citation 560X business jet in San Diego, missing by a mere 100 feet.</p>

<p>Adding to the administration’s challenges, the FAA has been devoid of a permanent leader since April 2022. Following the withdrawal of President Joe Biden’s nominee for the post in March, a successor is yet to be named.</p>

<p>Rail safety, especially after the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, has turned into a heated subject. The derailment resulted in a massive fire and the spillage of over a million gallons of hazardous materials.</p>

<p>The GOP’s letter is exhaustive, seeking detailed communication between the Transportation Department and the White House. It addresses a slew of transportation incidents, most notably the East Palestine derailment and another near-miss aviation event in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>On the legislative side, the Senate Commerce Committee greenlit rail safety legislation in May, focusing on trains transporting flammable substances. The measure, however, is yet to receive nods from the House or the Senate.</p>

<p>With public safety at stake, these investigations and initiatives hold significant weight, offering a glimmer of hope for comprehensive and effective transportation safety reforms in the future.</p>
