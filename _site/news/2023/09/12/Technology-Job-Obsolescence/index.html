  <p>A growing number of Americans are apprehensive about the role technology might play in phasing out their employment. A new Gallup poll suggests that over one in five American workers now harbor concerns about their job’s future due to rapid technological advancements.</p>

<p><strong>Rising Concern Over Time</strong></p>

<p>Published this Monday, the poll reveals that 22% of Americans worry that technology might render their jobs redundant. These concerns have seen a marked increase over the years since Gallup first started monitoring this sentiment in August 2017. At that time, a mere 13% expressed such fears. The figure showed a modest rise to 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, only to dip back to 15% in 2021. An interesting observation tied to this is the increasing prevalence and attention on artificial intelligence since the 2021 poll.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Concerns</strong></p>

<p>Gallup’s data shows a significant shift in concerns among the college-educated workforce, with their fears spiking from 8% to 20%. On the other hand, workers without a college degree have maintained a nearly constant worry level at 24%. This indicates that the disparity in technological replacement concerns between the college-educated and non-college-educated workers has narrowed, with both groups now exhibiting parallel anxiety levels.</p>

<p><strong>Demographic Differences in Concern</strong></p>

<p>The poll further underscores the generational difference in apprehension, indicating that younger workers are more concerned about technology making their jobs obsolete than their older counterparts. Additionally, those earning less than $100,000 annually express more anxiety compared to those with higher incomes.</p>

<p><strong>Other Workplace Fears</strong></p>

<p>Beyond the dread of technology-induced job redundancy, the Gallup poll highlighted other significant worries among American workers. The leading concern is a potential reduction in wages or benefits. While 31% of the respondents fear a cut in their benefits, 24% are anxious about a potential wage decrease. Concurrently, 20% of those polled are concerned about potential layoffs, with 19% fearing a reduction in working hours. Interestingly, only 7% expressed worry over their jobs being outsourced overseas.</p>

<p><strong>Survey Details</strong></p>

<p>For this research, Gallup interviewed 491 part-time or full-time adult workers in the U.S. between August 1 and August 23. The findings have a margin of error of ±5 percentage points.</p>
