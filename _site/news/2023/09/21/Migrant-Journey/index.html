  <p>The path to a new life can be hard. For thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Caribbean countries, it’s now taking them on a train journey towards the US border.</p>

<h2 id="all-aboard-the-migrant-express">All Aboard the Migrant Express</h2>

<p>Migrants, in search of a brighter future, have turned to trains as their way into Piedras Negras, Coahuila. This city shares its borders with Texas. From here, many hope to enter the US.</p>

<p>Starting their trip in the bustling industrial city of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, these determined individuals rode in and on the rail cars, moving towards their destination.</p>

<p>But things didn’t always go as planned. Mexican authorities caught wind of their journey and brought their train to a halt. Despite this hiccup, these migrants pressed on, eventually making their way to Piedras Negras.</p>

<h2 id="piedras-negras---a-gateway-city">Piedras Negras - A Gateway City</h2>

<p>Why Piedras Negras? This city has become a significant spot for migrants. Nearly 4,000 migrants began their crossing into Texas just this past Wednesday. The city’s appeal? The area lacks the extensive border barriers and fencing seen in other regions, making it an attractive point of entry.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>The train-riding migrants shared stories of their long journey. Many mentioned that they began in Mexico City with travel permits in hand. But the path wasn’t easy. Along the way, these migrants faced challenges from Mexican immigration agents (known as INM) and police forces. Some even claimed they were extorted by these officials.</p>

<p>While the story of these migrants is just one of many, it highlights the lengths people will go to for a chance at a better life. As the situation at the border evolves, the world watches, waiting to see how both sides will respond.</p>
