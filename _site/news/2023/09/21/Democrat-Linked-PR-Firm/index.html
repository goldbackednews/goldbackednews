  <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent encounters with protestors in cities like California and New York over his proposed judicial reforms have raised eyebrows. The protests, although seemingly grassroots, might have more intricate ties, namely to Trident DMG, a PR firm based in Washington with known affiliations to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Trident DMG’s connections to the Democratic Party are no secret in the corridors of power in Washington. And now, with reports suggesting their potential role in organizing opposition against Netanyahu on U.S. soil, these ties are receiving greater scrutiny. Their association with Blue and White Future, an organization from Israel that stands against Netanyahu, has only fueled these speculations. Reports highlight a three-month contract worth $75,000 between Trident DMG and the Israeli organization, putting the PR firm’s Democrat links under the spotlight.</p>

<p>Eleanor McManus, co-founder and partner of Trident DMG, while emphasizing the company’s role in promoting awareness about the so-called “democracy crisis” in Israel, stopped short of confirming or denying their direct involvement in the U.S. protests against Netanyahu. However, her statement did little to dissuade discussions about the firm’s connections to Democratic power players and their possible influence in international political issues.</p>

<p>The growing concerns in the Jewish community, fearing an amplification of anti-Israel narratives due to these protests, adds another layer to this unfolding drama. With Trident DMG at the crosshairs, and their Democratic links being examined closely, the tale of foreign influences shaping domestic protests gains yet another chapter.</p>
