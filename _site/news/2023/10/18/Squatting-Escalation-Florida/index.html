  <p>Escambia County in Florida has been thrust into the limelight due to a troubling increase in squatting activity and homeless encampments on private lands. The community, which prides itself on its tranquility and harmony, finds itself grappling with an issue that has seen both homeowners and squatters at odds.</p>

<p>Gwen Gibson, a resident of Brent, Florida, voiced her frustrations over the constant trespassing on her property. “There are so many people going back and forth it’s ridiculous,” Gibson reported to the Pensacola News Journal, mentioning the rise in activities like drug trading and prostitution.</p>

<p>Adjacent to Gibson’s home is a plot owned by the Merrill family. Over the years, this land has become a hotspot for homeless camps. Only after several delays, following an order from the Escambia County magistrate, did local entrepreneur Collier Merrill initiate the cleanup of the site in August.</p>

<p>Despite posting “no trespassing” signs and installing security cameras, Merrill admits he has been lenient, hoping the squatters would voluntarily vacate the premises. Addressing the issue, he said, “We’ve been working on another project, hoping they would go ahead and move on their own, but actually they’re not going to do that.” He has now prioritized resolving this predicament in line with the county’s guidelines.</p>

<p>However, Gibson’s observations suggest that the problem has amplified since the August cleanup. More individuals are reported to frequent the Merrill land daily, with many trespassing on her property to reach the site. The aftermath of squatting has also led to disturbing scenes: from squatters using trees as restrooms, visible from Gibson’s kitchen, to cleaning crews becoming physically ill from the distressing cleanup conditions.</p>

<p>The broader sentiment in the community echoes Gibson’s concerns. The problems of squatting and homelessness aren’t isolated to her vicinity but have burgeoned across the county, with many attributing the pandemic as a significant exacerbating factor.</p>

<p>Tim Day, Escambia’s Senior Natural Resources Manager, pinpointed the change in behavior during the pandemic. Before the virus’s outbreak, campers typically hid deep within properties to remain inconspicuous. But with authorities refraining from removing them during the pandemic to prevent virus spread, many campers grew bolder, openly setting up camps without much concern for privacy.</p>

<p>Local politicians like Escambia Commissioner Mike Kohler have also been inundated with grievances regarding the issue. “That is the biggest, No. 1 problem in the county,” said Kohler. The commissioner highlighted the urgency to address this escalating problem, an issue that’s fast becoming the main talking point amongst the local community.</p>

<p>However, for Gibson, the challenges extend beyond mere property invasion. She recounted menacing confrontations with campers, threats from men wielding machetes, and confrontations with church groups and advocacy bodies. She remains steadfast, though: “I’ve been dealing with this for years. I feel very unsafe,” said Gibson. “It’s been hard, and sometimes I think I can’t do this anymore, but I’m not giving up. I haven’t done anything wrong. Why should I have to leave?”</p>

<p>As the county searches for resolutions, the essence of the community is at stake, and residents like Gibson wait, hoping for a swift and fair solution.</p>
