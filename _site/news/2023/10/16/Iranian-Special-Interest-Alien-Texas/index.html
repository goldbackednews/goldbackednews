  <p>Recent apprehensions at the US southern border have heightened concerns over national security. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has confirmed that a fourth Iranian, identified as a “special interest alien”, was detained this month in Eagle Pass, Texas.</p>

<p>The term “special interest alien” is used for individuals from countries believed by the US government to either protect or promote terrorism, or those that might pose a potential national security risk to the United States. Such detainees undergo added vetting and questioning following their apprehension.</p>

<p>CBP sources informed Fox News that the recently apprehended Iranian man, in his 40s, was taken into custody after crossing the border around 3 a.m. in Eagle Pass. Notably, he voluntarily surrendered to the border agents after the illegal crossing.</p>

<p>This month, Eagle Pass has seen a surge in the apprehension of “special interest aliens”. In a separate incident, two Lebanese nationals were detained. Given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel and its association with Hezbollah, a group funded by Iran and labeled a terror organization by the State Department, these apprehensions are particularly alarming.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, CBP officials have reported the detention of 19 Iranians and 17 Syrians in a span of a week.</p>

<p>These apprehensions coincide with growing security concerns, especially in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7th, which resulted in the death of 1,300 Israelis and left thousands injured.</p>

<p>The National Security Council’s spokesman, John Kirby, stated last week that while Iran shows “broad complicity” due to its backing of Hamas, there is no evidence to suggest Iran’s involvement in planning or executing the recent Hamas attack.</p>

<p>However, a threat assessment released by the Department of Homeland Security last month emphasized the potential security threats. The document noted an uptick in agents encountering individuals on the watch list and highlighted concerns that “terrorists and criminal actors may exploit the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to enter the United States.”</p>

<p>The consistent rise in apprehensions at the southern border underscores the growing challenges faced by CBP agents. With global tensions on the rise, the focus on securing borders and ensuring the safety of citizens becomes paramount.</p>
