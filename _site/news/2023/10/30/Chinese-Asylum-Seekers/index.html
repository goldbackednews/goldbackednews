  <p>The U.S.-Mexico border has witnessed a remarkable surge in asylum seekers, with a notable increase in Chinese migrants making the arduous journey. Deng Guangsen, a 28-year-old from Guangdong, China, embodies the plight of many, having traversed seven countries over two months to reach San Diego. Using broken English learned from “Harry Potter” movies, Deng shared his story, reflecting a sense of desolation and determination.</p>

<p>Chinese migrants are now the fourth-highest nationality crossing the perilous Darién Gap, seeking refuge from an oppressive political climate and dim economic prospects. The trend represents a diverse wave of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, contributing to record-high illegal crossings. The aftermath of the pandemic, coupled with stringent COVID-19 policies, has reignited emigration from China, resulting in a projected loss of 310,000 Chinese nationals this year.</p>

<p>The phenomenon, known as “runxue” or the study of running away, has gained traction online, turning into an internet meme that symbolizes the desperation and desire to escape China’s current conditions. Cai Xia, editor-in-chief of Yibao and a former professor at the Central Party School in Beijing, notes that this wave of emigration is marked by a cross-section of society, from educated professionals to small business owners.</p>

<p>Migrants unable to secure visas are opting for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, with Border Patrol arresting 22,187 Chinese nationals from January through September 2023, a significant increase from the previous year. The popular route starts in Ecuador, a country with no visa requirements for Chinese citizens, and continues through Central America to the U.S. border. Social media plays a crucial role, providing detailed guides and tips for the journey, while translation apps enable navigation through non-English speaking countries.</p>

<p>The journey, though perilous and expensive, is a calculated risk for many seeking freedom and opportunities absent in China. Xi Yan, a Chinese writer, and her daughter chose to fly to Mexico and cross the border with the help of a local guide, escaping high unemployment and oppressive government policies back home.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges that lie ahead, including a bottlenecked asylum process and the uncertainty of life in a new country, the promise of freedom and opportunity keeps the dream of America alive for Chinese asylum seekers. As they navigate the complexities of immigration and adapt to their new surroundings, their stories underscore the universal pursuit of a better life, free from oppression and filled with possibility.</p>
