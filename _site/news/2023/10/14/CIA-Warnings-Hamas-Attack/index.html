  <p>Amidst the aftermath of last week’s catastrophic attack on Israel, revelations have emerged that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had issued multiple warnings signaling a forthcoming Hamas assault. Notably, leading news outlets, The New York Times and CNN, shed light on this matter on Friday, raising pressing questions about potential intelligence oversights.</p>

<p>With sources confirming that the CIA had delivered at least two distinct warnings in the weeks preceding the onslaught on Israel, the gravest of which came merely days prior to the event, there’s increasing scrutiny on whether these alarms were heeded. The New York Times disclosed that neither President Joe Biden nor key White House officials had been briefed on these reports, further amplifying concerns.</p>

<p>These CIA assessments, particularly those dated Sept. 28 and then Oct. 5 and 6, primarily stemmed from intelligence insights provided by Israel. Whether Israel was duly informed remains uncertain. However, as the dust settles from last Saturday’s attack, launched on Oct. 7, the catastrophic results of these alerts going unheeded are starkly apparent. A staggering death toll of over 1,300 in Israel includes 27 American citizens.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Sept. 28 report had cautioned about Hamas gearing up for a series of rocket attacks on Israel, an unfortunately common event in the region’s volatile history. The subsequent reports, on Oct. 5 and 6, progressively elevated the urgency, with the latter alerting about an impending attack.</p>

<p>Yet, the gravity of the situation extends beyond these recent revelations. It emerges that Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, disclosed that Israel had also been warned by Egypt just three days ahead of the Hamas strike. The depth and specificity of that warning remain undisclosed.</p>

<p>Highlighting the recurring nature of these alerts, an intelligence source mentioned to CNN, “This is something that has historically been the norm between Hamas and Israel.” Consequently, both the U.S. and Israel now find themselves facing fierce criticism for the perceived lapse in intelligence. Despite the warnings not fully encompassing the magnitude of Hamas’ eventual brutality, they follow a concerning trend of intelligence alerts over the past year being frequently sidelined.</p>

<p>A senior Arab official, voicing the frustration echoed by many, stated, “They never listened every time we warned them.” The aftermath of the attack has been nothing short of horrific, with the scale of devastation far surpassing the expectations of even the attackers.</p>

<p>In the backdrop of this tragedy and the emerging reports on missed warnings, the question lingers: Will this be a turning point in heeding intelligence assessments in the future?</p>
