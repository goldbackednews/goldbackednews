  <p>The Oregon State Board of Education has decided to extend the suspension of basic skills graduation requirements for high schoolers for an additional five years. This suspension has been in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and with this extension, students in Oregon will not be required to demonstrate proficiency in core academic areas such as reading, writing, or math to earn their high school diploma until at least the 2027-2028 school year.</p>

<p>The board justified its decision by stating that the basic skills requirement disproportionately harms students of color, as well as students with disabilities and those learning English as a second language. However, this explanation has not quelled the concerns of critics who believe that the suspension could devalue Oregon high school diplomas and leave graduates unprepared for future endeavors.</p>

<p>Former Republican gubernatorial candidate Christine Drazan has been particularly vocal in her opposition to the board’s decision. She has expressed fears that the suspension of these academic standards could result in Oregon diplomas resembling “participation prizes” rather than certificates of academic achievement. Drazan has urged the state to maintain rigorous academic standards to ensure that students are adequately prepared for life after graduation.</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, the Oregon State Board of Education voted unanimously to continue the suspension of the graduation requirement. Under the original requirement, 11th graders were required to demonstrate competence in essential academic subjects through standardized testing or work samples. Those who failed to meet the standards were required to take additional classes in math and writing during their senior year.</p>

<p>Critics of the board’s decision have expressed concern that lowering academic standards could harm students in the long run, leaving them ill-equipped for college or the workforce. Hundreds of public comments were submitted in opposition to the move, many of which were generated through a call to action from Drazan’s advocacy group, A New Direction Oregon.</p>

<p>Board Chair Guadalupe Martinez Zapata dismissed the opposition as a “campaign of misinformation,” defending the decision as a step toward educational equity. However, this stance has not silenced critics who argue that maintaining high academic standards is crucial for the success of all students, regardless of their background.</p>

<p>Oregon has one of the lowest graduation rates in the country, yet it also has some of the most rigorous credit requirements. The suspension of the basic skills requirement raises questions about the balance between maintaining high standards and ensuring equitable access to education.</p>

<p>Drazan has called on concerned parents and community members to voice their concerns to Governor Tina Kotek’s office, emphasizing the need for the education board to be more responsive to the needs of students and families. As the debate over academic standards in Oregon continues, the future of the state’s education system hangs in the balance.</p>
