  <p>A shocking incident at Nuestro Elementary School in Live Oak, California, has drawn considerable attention and concern. Wendy Munson, 57, a second-grade teacher at the school, was arrested on charges of teaching while under the influence of alcohol.</p>

<p>Responding to a report on Monday morning, sheriff’s deputies found Munson visibly impaired during her teaching hours. Following this discovery, she was subjected to a sobriety test which she subsequently failed. Munson was then arrested at approximately 8:20 a.m. and charged with driving with a blood alcohol content exceeding .08 percent, drunk driving, and child abuse with potential for severe bodily injury, as outlined in a Sutter County Sheriff’s Department press release.</p>

<p>The alarming incident came to light when a co-worker at the school contacted local law enforcement. The arresting officers stated that when they arrived at the scene, Munson was actively teaching her class. It was later revealed that her blood alcohol level was nearly double the legal limit, even two hours after the initial interaction with the deputies.</p>

<p>Baljinder Dhillon, Nuestro Elementary School District Superintendent, promptly addressed the matter by sending a letter to parents, assuring them of their children’s safety. He mentioned that Munson was taken into custody without any disturbances, ensuring that the students did not witness the unsettling arrest. The letter also highlighted the school’s proactive approach by stating, “Your 2nd graders will have a long-term substitute. Our students’ safety and well-being remain our highest priority.”</p>

<p>Kaitlynn Conley, a concerned parent, expressed her disbelief in an interview with CBS News. “I thought it was crazy,” she stated. Adding her perspective on Munson’s actions, she said, “I think she should’ve called out of work. I know people have fun weekends, but that was definitely not okay as an educator.”</p>

<p>In addition to these reports, the sheriff’s office confirmed the existence of footage capturing Munson driving to school in her inebriated state.</p>

<p>Wendy Munson’s arraignment is set for 3 p.m. Wednesday. As of now, there is no confirmation regarding her legal representation.</p>

<p>The incident at Nuestro Elementary underscores the need for schools to maintain strict safety and professional standards, ensuring an optimal environment for both students and staff.</p>
