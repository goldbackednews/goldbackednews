  <p>In a robust response to the escalating crime rate, Jim’s West Steaks &amp; Hoagies, a cherished Philly cheesesteak institution, has enlisted armed security personnel to shield its patrons and workforce. This measure underscores a broader trend in Philadelphia, where businesses increasingly prioritize security in the face of mounting threats.</p>

<p>Victoria Wylie, the co-owner of the famed eatery, emphasized the importance of proactive safety measures. “We’re no longer waiting for tragedies to strike. Prevention is our mantra,” Wylie shared with Fox News. In September, after the restaurant’s re-launch, security became paramount, especially considering a past armed robbery incident at the establishment.</p>

<p>In recent years, Philadelphia has joined the ranks of various U.S. cities witnessing a crime surge. The city recorded a disturbing increase in homicides, surpassing 500 in consecutive years. Additionally, Philadelphia Police Department data reveals an alarming 16% rise in overall crime year-to-date.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, Wylie’s concerns are far from misplaced. “West Philadelphia, where we serve our delectable cheesesteaks, is not immune to this crime wave,” Wylie remarked. As someone reintroducing a beloved restaurant to its eager fans, she explained, “It’s unpredictable. We don’t truly know who might walk in.”</p>

<p>To give a clearer picture, a video circulated on Jim’s West Steaks &amp; Hoagies’ Instagram showcased an armed security guard, toting an assault-style rifle, standing guard. Wylie confirmed these guards’ presence during operational hours, underlining their unwavering commitment to ensuring safety.</p>

<p>Historical data sheds light on the stakes at play. In 2015, armed robbers made away with $215 from the cash register and the pockets of unsuspecting patrons at Jim’s Steaks. Such unsettling memories bolstered the current ownership’s resolve to strengthen security measures.</p>

<p>While certain crime categories like armed robberies have witnessed a decrease, they remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. September was particularly tumultuous. Swarms of thieves descended on various Philadelphia businesses, leading to widescale lootings. Such rampant theft compelled the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to momentarily shutter all 48 city-based retail outlets, prioritizing safety.</p>

<p>Benjamin Nochum, the store manager of Patriot Pharmacy, which was looted in September, expressed his anguish, “Looters aren’t just stealing from businesses; they’re stealing from our communities.”</p>

<p>Amid this backdrop, Wylie remains steadfast. Her primary aim is not just to serve the city’s favorite cheesesteaks but to provide a safe dining experience. “Our priority is people’s safety,” she stated firmly. In her view, the best way to deter potential criminals is by showing that safety precautions are already in place. Her hope is for patrons to continue relishing their cheesesteaks, knowing they’re in a secure environment.</p>
