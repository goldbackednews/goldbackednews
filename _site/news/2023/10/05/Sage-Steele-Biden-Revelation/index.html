  <p>Sage Steele, the ex-ESPN anchor, stirred up headlines recently when she divulged a disconcerting interaction with President Biden during an interview on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast.</p>

<p>Steele shed light on an episode in March 2021 when she interviewed the President. She conveyed her concerns regarding what she believed was Biden’s cognitive decline, particularly when he “trailed off” during a chat before their scheduled recording.</p>

<p>“I was trying just to fill time. And he said, ‘You know, I used to play football’… And so he started to tell football stories of his greatness… He said ‘I was good’ and then he went silent and he goes ‘Uhh… never mind,’” recalled Steele.</p>

<p>Maher, known for his candid observations, drew comparisons to a scene from a ‘Naked Gun’ movie. Steele’s poignant description left many wondering about the President’s fitness for office, given the high demands of the role.</p>

<p>But Steele’s revelations didn’t stop there. She went on to discuss her unexpected encounter with former President Trump at his Bedminster golf course. Their connection revolved around their shared love for football and Trump’s endeavors to rejuvenate sports post-COVID. Steele also confessed to being “thoroughly entertained” by Trump’s audacious tweets.</p>

<p>Maher’s astonishment was palpable as he found out that Steele didn’t cast her vote for either Biden or Barack Obama in previous elections. Steele was quick to clarify, “I don’t love [Trump]. There’s a big difference in voting for someone and loving them.” She emphasized the importance of differentiating between politicians’ personal attributes and their policies.</p>

<p>This recent revelation from Steele, combined with the ever-politicized climate, further underscores the need for transparency and candid discussions about our nation’s leaders. As the public digests Steele’s unsettling observations, questions regarding the competency of those in power remain at the forefront.</p>
