  <p>In a startling turn of events surrounding the kidnapping case of Charlotte Sena, the man claiming to be the son of the prime suspect, Craig Ross Jr., broke his silence. As the media spotlight zooms in on this harrowing case, the supposed offspring hopes that his father “dies in prison.”</p>

<p>Charlotte Sena’s disappearance made headlines when she vanished after a simple bike ride in Lake Moreau State Park. Fortunately, the child was later found, having been hidden in a cabinet within Ross’s unkempt camper, parked behind another property in the vicinity.</p>

<p>This tumultuous case has captured the nation’s attention, as desperate searches led to an unexpected outcome. After the young girl’s ordeal, her family expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the various agencies, volunteers, and community members who rallied together to ensure Charlotte’s safe return. The Sena family is now channeling their efforts to help Charlotte recover, dedicating a GoFundMe campaign to support the 9-year-old’s journey.</p>

<p>Ross Jr., now in custody on charges of first-degree kidnapping, had previously left a ransom note in the Sena family’s mailbox, leading to his arrest. The swift action of state police was pivotal in capturing Ross Jr., with their investigation further bolstered by evidence from a past DUI arrest in 1999.</p>

<p>As investigators don their Tyvek suits, poring over Ross Jr.’s Porter Corners residence and removing key evidence, the unexpected appearance of a man claiming to be the accused’s son added another layer to this unfolding drama. Frustrated and overwhelmed, he vented his dismay, stating, “Yeah, he’s my father, but why do I have to deal with this? Everyone is asking me all this. I don’t know anything. I hate him and hope he dies in prison.”</p>

<p>This case serves as a sobering reminder of the impact of crime not only on the victims but also on the families of those accused. The community’s support has been unwavering, with the New York State Police and the FBI receiving particular praise for their role in ensuring Charlotte’s safe return.</p>

<p>As the case continues to unravel, the focus remains on supporting young Charlotte, highlighting the importance of community vigilance, and hoping for justice to prevail.</p>
