  <p>In the aftermath of a severe terror assault on Israel by Hamas militants, Germany has put a hold on its humanitarian aid payments to Palestine. The decision comes as Berlin embarks on a thorough review of all support payments to ensure they align with its political and humanitarian objectives.</p>

<p>Germany, recognized as “one of the largest donors in the Palestinian territories,” had earmarked a whopping €250 million (equivalent to approximately $265 million) for Palestine’s assistance over the next two years. Half of this aid was slated for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This funding typically covers pivotal projects focused on bettering water quality, healthcare, food security, and job opportunities. Despite being channeled to Palestine, many of these initiatives are perceived to benefit Israel too.</p>

<p>However, in light of the recent wave of violence that shocked the region, Svenja Schulze, the German government’s development minister, articulated the nation’s concerns. “These attacks on Israel are a terrible turning point. We will therefore examine our entire commitment to the Palestinian territories,” Schulze commented, as quoted by the German broadcaster, NTV.</p>

<p>Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner echoed these sentiments, pressing for an expedited determination concerning the aid designated for Palestine. Highlighting the gravity of the situation, Lindner remarked, “The terror is shocking. We shouldn’t just react to it with words.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the chorus of dissent wasn’t restricted to government quarters. Opposition MP, Roderich Kiesewetter of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), took a sterner stance, advocating for an immediate cessation of the millions funneled into Palestine.</p>

<p>Amid these turbulent times, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reached out to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Their conversation underscored Berlin’s unwavering support for Israel and its inherent right to self-defence, especially against the “barbaric attacks” orchestrated by Hamas. Furthermore, Chancellor Scholz is expected to liaise with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, aiming to tap into Cairo’s potential mediating role to broker peace in this volatile scenario.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the home front, Chancellor Scholz vehemently condemned the pro-Palestine demonstrations in Berlin. He expressed his dismay, asserting, “We do not accept it when the hideous attacks against Israel are celebrated here on our streets… The suffering, the destruction and the death of so many people cannot be a cause for joy for anyone.”</p>

<p>This escalating conflict, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret, has taken a tragic toll. The Israeli government’s latest data indicates a harrowing loss, with over 600 fatalities attributed to Hamas since Saturday, while thousands more nurse their injuries and over a hundred remain captive.</p>

<p>Germany’s aid suspension, while significant, is just one facet of a multi-dimensional crisis that demands international attention and swift resolutions.</p>
