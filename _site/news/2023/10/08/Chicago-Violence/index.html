  <p>Under the ostensibly ineffective leadership of Mayor Brandon Johnson, Chicago faced a harrowing weekend where at least 19 individuals became victims of gunfire, with two succumbing to their injuries. This surge in violence serves as a distressing testament to the city’s deteriorating safety conditions.</p>

<p>On Friday evening, the ABC 7 / Chicago Sun-Times shed light on the beginning of the tragic weekend spree. Around 6:30 p.m., in an alley in the “10200 block of South Carpenter Street,” a 43-year-old man was ruthlessly shot in the chest and head, leading to his immediate death.</p>

<p>Saturday didn’t bring any reprieve. By 10:45 a.m., in the “1500 block of East 74th Street,” a group targeted a young couple, a 23-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, resulting in the tragic death of the woman. The man, although wounded, refused medical aid.</p>

<p>The alarming frequency of these incidents brings to the forefront the pressing questions about Mayor Johnson’s capabilities. A database from the Sun-Times underscores this dire scenario, highlighting that from January 1, 2023, to date, 455 individuals have lost their lives to gun violence in Chicago.</p>

<p>The overwhelming spike in crime under Mayor Johnson’s watch is not just a statistic—it’s an alarming reality for the city’s residents. These continual violent outbreaks are prompting both local and national discussions, questioning Mayor Johnson’s strategies and effectiveness in addressing the escalating gun violence.</p>

<p>As the Windy City yearns for safety and stability, there is a rising demand for better leadership, one that can offer tangible solutions and restore peace to the beleaguered streets of Chicago.</p>
