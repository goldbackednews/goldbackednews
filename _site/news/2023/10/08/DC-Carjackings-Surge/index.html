  <p>In a startling revelation, carjackings in Washington D.C. skyrocketed by an astounding 111% in the first ten months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Police, while still piecing together the ‘why,’ highlight a noteworthy detail: the majority of the arrested individuals are below 18 years.</p>

<p>In 2023, the U.S. capital reported a whopping 760 carjackings. In contrast, there were only 360 in the same time frame last year. To put things into perspective, the carjackings this year alone surpassed the total of 2018, 2019, and 2020 combined. These alarming figures suggest a deep-rooted issue that law enforcement and the justice system must address.</p>

<p>Most carjackings reportedly occur around the <strong>H Street Corridor</strong> and the regions adjacent to the <strong>Anacostia River bordering Maryland</strong>. Police data emphasizes that a staggering <strong>65% of those involved in these thefts are juveniles</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not just the age of the culprits that’s concerning. U.S. Attorney for D.C., Matthew Graves, admitted that the majority of individuals arrested for such crimes are young. However, his office often does not prosecute them, especially if they are under 16. In 2022, Graves <strong>refused to prosecute 67%</strong> of those who could have been tried in the D.C. Superior Court. This number is notably high when considering juvenile crimes, where he did not press charges for 26%.</p>

<p>One might wonder if this trend of non-prosecution is contributing to the surge. D.C.’s juvenile court has jurisdiction over various offenses, from drug-related crimes to property offenses. Yet, to try a juvenile as an adult, prosecutors need to initiate a transfer. The U.S. Attorney’s Office only prosecutes the serious crimes listed in the statute.</p>

<p>While Graves’ office can potentially prosecute 16 and 17-year-olds as adults, they seem to prioritize certain cases. The police affirm that the U.S. Attorney’s Office holds the initial right to decide on the prosecution. If they refuse, the case gets presented to the office of the Attorney General.</p>

<p>Police officials, like Assistant Chief of the Investigative Services Bureau Carlos Heraud, are still trying to pinpoint the exact reasons for this surge. Is it due to influence from social media, a lack of perceived consequences, or peer discussions at schools? The exact cause remains elusive.</p>

<p>This surge in crime isn’t isolated to carjackings. The entire District witnessed a significant escalation in violent crimes this year. The rates have soared up by nearly <strong>40%</strong> year over year.</p>

<p>The city’s deteriorating safety was further underscored when Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) faced a carjacking near the Capitol Building. He described the horrifying ordeal, stating that while he has a black belt, facing multiple guns left him with no choice but to hand over his vehicle.</p>

<p>As D.C. grapples with this unsettling rise in crime, the immediate focus should be on understanding the underlying causes and implementing robust preventive measures. Only then can residents hope for safer streets.</p>
