  <p>Air Force police at Joint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis in Texas were compelled to open fire on a vehicle that breached the base’s gates at an excessive speed this weekend. The unidentified driver aggressively sped towards the Air Force guards, breaking through the access control point and momentarily gaining access to the installation before attempting to exit back through the gate.</p>

<p>According to Angela Casarez, a spokesperson for Joint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis, the security forces had no choice but to take defensive measures. “Security forces pursued the driver and took defensive measures when the suspected gate runner attempted to exit the installation via the inbound lane traveling at an excessive rate of speed,” she explained. The situation was tense and rapid, with the base’s Air Force police acting swiftly to neutralize the threat.</p>

<p>Despite the vehicle’s quick penetration of the base, the driver was unable to reach any of the training areas located on the expansive, more than 27,000-acre installation. Remarkably, no injuries were reported from the incident, either to the Air Force personnel or the driver.</p>

<p>The San Antonio Police Department later apprehended the suspect, approximately nine miles from the base, following his involvement in a separate incident. The base, primarily used for training Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps combat troops, is a part of the larger Joint Base San Antonio, which includes other major installations like Joint Base-Fort Sam Houston, Joint Base-Randolph, and Joint Base-Lackland.</p>

<p>This incident comes on the heels of another security scare at Joint Base-Fort Sam Houston, where a gate was temporarily closed, and several buildings were placed on lockdown following reports of gunshots from a nearby wooded area. According to an Air Force spokesperson, there is no evidence to suggest that these two incidents are connected. Both the gate and buildings were reopened hours after the incidents, with no reported injuries to military personnel.</p>

<p>The spokesperson for Joint Base San Antonio confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Air Force Security Forces did indeed open fire in self-defense when the driver posed an imminent threat to their safety. Fortunately, no injuries or damage to Air Force property were reported. The incident remains under thorough investigation as officials work to piece together the events of that alarming day and ensure the safety and security of military installations.</p>
