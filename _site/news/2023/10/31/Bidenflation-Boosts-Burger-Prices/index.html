  <p>In an era of skyrocketing prices and economic uncertainty, McDonald’s has found a way to turn the tide in its favor, reporting soaring profits and sales in the third quarter. The culprit? None other than the ominous Bidenflation, as rising burger prices contribute to the fast-food giant’s unexpected financial upswing.</p>

<p>The company’s profits and sales have beaten all estimates, pushing shares higher and leaving investors satisfied. However, this leaves the average American grappling with the reality of rising costs and a strained budget. Revenue shot up by 14 percent, reaching an astounding $6.69 billion, surpassing the expected $6.56 billion. Comparable store sales grew by 8.8 percent, leaving analysts’ 8.0 percent increase prediction in the dust.</p>

<p>Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s Chief Executive, confidently stated, “The macroeconomic environment is unfolding in line with our expectations for the year, and we continued to deliver convenience and value for our customers.” But at what cost?</p>

<p>In the U.S. alone, comparable store sales witnessed an 8.1 percent increase, outpacing the forecasted 7.5 percent growth. “Comparable sales results benefited from strong average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases,” McDonald’s admitted. The stark reality is that these “strategic” price hikes are a direct result of the rampant inflation under the Biden administration, coined as Bidenflation.</p>

<p>The increase in prices did manage to counteract a noticeable decline in foot traffic to McDonald’s locations. Yet, this reveals a concerning trend: higher costs are driving customers away, particularly those in lower income brackets. Kempczinski noted, “One of the things that we saw industry-wide is that that low-income consumer, which we would say is $45,000 and under, was negative from an industry standpoint.”</p>

<p>Net income saw a boost, rising to $2.32 billion, or $3.17 a share, a significant increase from the previous year’s $1.98 billion, or $2.68 a share. Adjusted earnings per share settled at $3.19, surpassing the estimated $3.00 per share.</p>

<p>While McDonald’s might be reveling in its financial success, the harsh reality of Bidenflation looms large, with everyday Americans bearing the brunt of rising prices and a cost of living crisis. The fast-food giant’s prosperity serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for economic reform and relief from the financial strain imposed by the current administration. It’s high time for a change, and the American people deserve nothing less.</p>
