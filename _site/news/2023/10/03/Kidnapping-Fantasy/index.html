  <p>In a harrowing case emerging from Tacoma, Washington, a repeat offender is facing life imprisonment after the court found him guilty of holding a woman hostage in his garage for several weeks, “acting out a fantasy.”</p>

<p>Henry Hauser, a 56-year-old with a history of heinous crimes, was convicted last week on kidnapping and sexual assault charges. With his sentencing set for Friday, the community anticipates a potential life sentence without parole.</p>

<h2 id="a-predatory-offer">A Predatory Offer</h2>

<p>The female victim, who was homeless at the time, shared that on Nov. 10, 2021, Hauser had lured her with the promise of shelter in his garage. However, the initial friendly demeanor soon took a dark turn. The victim recounts that after spending some time in the garage, upon sensing discomfort and attempting to depart, she was forcefully restrained by Hauser. He bound her to his truck with a chain, leading to a weeks-long nightmare.</p>

<p>Throughout her captivity, the woman stated that Hauser drugged her repeatedly, resulting in significant “memory issues.” She detailed the disturbing statements Hauser made, suggesting he was living out a sinister fantasy. “He would ask her if she wanted to be hurt… say he was going to kill her slowly, but other times would say he wanted to ‘keep’ her,” the court affidavit reveals.</p>

<p>This terrifying ordeal finally came to an end on Nov. 28, 2021, when the victim managed to free herself due to Hauser’s carelessness, allowing her to escape and find help.</p>

<h2 id="a-long-trail-of-crimes">A Long Trail of Crimes</h2>

<p>Tacoma police apprehended Hauser on Dec. 2, 2021, after he was spotted on Walmart surveillance footage using the victim’s food stamps. His criminal history further exacerbates the alarming nature of his recent conviction. Hauser, labeled a level 3 sex offender, had previously severed his ankle monitor ties. He was also convicted in 2014 for kidnapping a minor at knifepoint, where he then administered drugs and assaulted her. Earlier in 2007, his rap sheet expanded with convictions for second-degree kidnapping involving a deadly weapon and felony harassment.</p>

<p>The community and the broader public eagerly await his sentencing, hoping for justice for the victim and to ensure a repeat offender like Hauser stays behind bars, preventing any more heinous acts.</p>

<p>Anyone with additional information on the case is urged to get in touch with the local police. The importance of community vigilance and timely reporting can’t be overstated to ensure safety for all.</p>
