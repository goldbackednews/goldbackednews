  <p>The tranquil city of Lewiston, Maine was rocked by a mass shooting that has left at least 22 people dead and dozens more injured. The incident unfolded late Wednesday night, shaking the local community to its core. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck addressed the media, confirming the scale of the tragedy, but also emphasizing the “very fluid” nature of the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Robert R. Card, a 40-year-old Bowdoin resident with military training, has been identified as a person of interest in the case. The Lewiston Police Department has issued a stark warning to the public, labeling Card as “armed and dangerous” and urging anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact law enforcement immediately. This marks one of the deadliest incidents in Maine’s recent history, surpassing the total number of homicides recorded in the state for the entire year of 2022.</p>

<p>The response from law enforcement has been swift and significant. Additional FBI agents, SWAT teams, and other resources have been deployed to assist in the manhunt and ensure community safety. Authorities have expanded the shelter-in-place order to include surrounding areas as the search for Card continues, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.</p>

<p>Local hospitals and emergency services are working tirelessly to tend to the injured, with Central Maine Medical Center confirming their response to a “mass casualty, mass shooter event.” The exact number of casualties remains unconfirmed as the situation continues to unfold.</p>

<p>President Biden has been briefed on the incident, and Maine Governor Janet Mills has urged residents to heed directions from law enforcement. Local schools, colleges, and municipal buildings have closed their doors in response to the tragedy, as the community grapples with the shock and heartache of this unprecedented event.</p>

<p>The search for Robert Card and the investigation into this mass shooting are ongoing. Law enforcement is leaving no stone unturned as they work to bring justice to the victims and their families. As the community of Lewiston, Maine, mourns the loss of life and comes to terms with this tragedy, the nation watches, waits, and stands in solidarity with them during this time of crisis.</p>
