  <p>In a striking display of aggression not witnessed before, Hamas, the militant Islamist group, has claimed responsibility for a brutal attack on Israel that has resulted in over 100 Israeli casualties. The incursion marked a significant escalation in the conflict between the two territories.</p>

<p>On Saturday, rockets flew from the Gaza Strip, hitting regions of southern Israel. The assault, which Hamas has proudly taken responsibility for, has led to over 100 Israelis losing their lives. The conflict’s gravity deepened as Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, dubbed the attack “the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.” He called on Palestinians everywhere to confront Israelis.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Israeli air strikes took the lives of 198 Palestinians, Gaza health officials confirmed. The wave of attacks has overwhelmed hospitals, which are currently treating nearly 985 injured individuals.</p>

<p>Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message, explicitly stated, “Citizens of Israel, we are at war.” Ambulance crews raced to regions around the Gaza Strip, while sirens warned residents across Israel. Hospital reports indicate hundreds of wounded, including civilians, signaling the broad reach of the conflict.</p>

<p>Gunmen have targeted civilians in Israeli towns, with video footage capturing confrontations in city streets. The Israeli military commented, “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” urging residents near the Gaza border to stay indoors.</p>

<p>U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson firmly condemned the unprovoked attacks. She stressed, “There is never any justification for terrorism,” reaffirming America’s allegiance to Israel. European leaders, too, stood in solidarity with Israel, denouncing Hamas’s actions. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union’s executive commission, labeled the attack as “terrorism in its most despicable form,” asserting Israel’s right to self-defense. Prominent European heads of state echoed this sentiment, highlighting their strong support for Israel during these trying times.</p>

<p>While confrontations between Israel and Gaza are not unprecedented, the recent surge in aggression is unparalleled. With the Israeli defense establishment making strategic evaluations and preparations, the conflict, which started with Hamas’s surprise attacks on Saturday, is anticipated to extend for several days.</p>

<p>The world watches closely, hoping for a swift resolution to prevent further loss of life and restore peace in the region.</p>
