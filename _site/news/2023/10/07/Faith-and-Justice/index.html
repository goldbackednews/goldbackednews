  <p>Detective Fil Waters, once a significant figure in the Houston Police Department’s (HPD) homicide unit, is not just another detective; he is a man of deep faith and conviction. With a remarkable 96% clearance rate and a 90% confession rate, he humbly credits a higher power - God.</p>

<p>After giving up a lucrative career in construction management, Waters felt a powerful “calling” to law enforcement. Over his 24-year tenure at HPD, he worked diligently on 400 homicide cases, clearing an overwhelming majority.</p>

<p>“My faith grew stronger… and I was getting more in tune with God’s plan for me,” Waters shared in a recent interview. Throughout his service, Waters felt that his connection with the divine played a pivotal role. From undercover narcotics operations, where he had to assume different identities, to the nuanced interview processes of his homicide days, he believed God was guiding him.</p>

<p>For Waters, his communication skills were integral. Not just the verbal exchange, but the capacity to empathize, listen, and build trust. He emphasized the necessity of patience and open-mindedness in interviews, especially when confronted with suspects accused of heinous crimes. To him, it was always about uncovering the truth.</p>

<p>“You have to be patient. And empathetic,” Waters stressed. “It’s always a journey for the truth.” He often entered interrogation rooms, conscious of a divine presence, praying for transparency and the ability to reflect Christ’s love.</p>

<p>One such challenging case was a 2015 triple homicide at a Houston car dealership. The investigation, later featured in Investigation Discovery’s “The Interrogator,” revolved around James Tinsley. Tinsley was convicted in 2017 for the brutal killing of three family members over car payments. Waters recounts this particular interrogation with Tinsley as intense, but he managed to extract valuable information even without a formal confession.</p>

<p>As a seasoned detective, Waters emphasizes the importance of listening more and speaking less. He encourages budding law enforcement officers to be open-minded and attentive, treating everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.</p>

<p>Waters’ legacy in HPD and his unwavering faith serve as a testament that in the search for truth, sometimes, the guiding light comes from above.</p>
