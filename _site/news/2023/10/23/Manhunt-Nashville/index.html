  <p>Tennessee law enforcement is in a race against time, searching for John C. Drake Jr., the 38-year-old estranged son of Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake. Drake Jr., with a lengthy criminal history and registered as a sex offender, is now the prime suspect in the shooting of two suburban police officers. The incident has spurred an intensive manhunt, putting local communities on high alert.</p>

<p>The officers, Ashely Boleyjack and Gregory Kern of La Vergne Police Department, are currently in stable condition after the brutal encounter on Saturday. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant as the search for Drake Jr. intensifies.</p>

<p>The incident unfolded around 2:30 p.m. outside a Dollar General store in La Vergne, roughly 20 miles southeast of Nashville. During a “struggle” with the officers, who were investigating a stolen car, Drake Jr. is accused of pulling out a gun and shooting both officers — one in the back and the other multiple times. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has since issued warrants for his arrest on two counts of attempted first-degree murder.</p>

<p>Drake Jr. is no stranger to law enforcement, with a criminal record spanning back to 2005, including dozens of prior arrests. His rap sheet reveals convictions for rape in 2009 and additional sex offenses over the past decade. Other charges include domestic violence, assault, unlawful possession of a weapon, evading arrest, and multiple violations of the state’s sex offender registry.</p>

<p>Despite his estranged relationship and troubled past, Police Chief John Drake issued a statement urging his son to be held accountable. “He has not been a part of my life for quite some time. He now needs to be found and held accountable for his actions today,” he said.</p>

<p>The La Vergne Police Department has described Drake Jr. as a 5 feet, 11 inches tall male, with a muscular build, facial hair, and dreadlocks, last seen wearing a black T-shirt with a white hockey mask emblem and gray pants. He is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

<p>Authorities have lifted the shelter-in-place order in La Vergne but continue to ask the public to remain cautious and report any suspicious activity. Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell expressed his support for Chief Drake and the wounded officers, acknowledging the complex emotions involved when a family member is implicated in such a heinous act.</p>

<p>As the manhunt enters its second day, the community and law enforcement alike hope for a swift resolution, ensuring justice for the injured officers and safety for the residents of Tennessee.</p>
