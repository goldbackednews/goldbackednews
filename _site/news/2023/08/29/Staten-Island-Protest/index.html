  <p>Hundreds of residents from the Arrochar neighborhood in northeast Staten Island made their voices loudly heard on August 28, taking to the streets to protest against the sudden conversion of the defunct St. John Villa Catholic school into a migrant shelter.</p>

<p>The rallying locals were vocal in their opposition, particularly because the decision to transform the building, meant to house 300 illegal border crossers, was taken without consulting the community. Residents accused New York’s Mayor Eric Adams of making the decision under the veil of secrecy. The frustration was palpable, with one resident expressing to the <em>New York Post</em>: “The city really screwed it up.”</p>

<p>The location of the proposed shelter has been a cause for concern, given its proximity to two operational elementary schools. As residents assembled in opposition, they prominently displayed a banner proclaiming, “NO F%*KIN WAY!”</p>

<p>Despite the rising discontent, the messaging at the rally was not universally against immigrants. Rally organizer John Tobacco clarified, “The message is that here in Staten Island, we love immigrants.” Emphasizing Staten Island’s Italian-American heritage, he added, “We love anyone who comes here legally.”</p>

<p>Tobacco’s core issue was with the volume of illegal immigrants, which he termed as “unsustainable.”</p>

<p>However, the stealthy manner in which the decision was made has left even local political figures in the dark. GOP state Assemblyman Michael Tannousis admitted to being unaware of the move until he read about it in a newspaper. Further intensifying the residents’ frustration was the Mayor’s prior reassurance that no migrants would be housed in the area.</p>

<p>This rally was not an isolated incident. A previous demonstration saw the participation of almost 1,000 disgruntled residents. Among the myriad concerns, some voiced their apprehension about the vaccination status of the incoming migrants, given the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>One resident highlighted the need for legal processes, drawing a parallel to her ancestors’ journey through Ellis Island, stressing the importance of immigrants entering the U.S. legally.</p>

<p>As tensions rise and protests continue, Staten Island remains a community in flux, searching for answers from their elected representatives and looking for a solution that respects both the rule of law and the rights of immigrants.</p>
