  <p>In an unsettling revelation, federal debt has swelled by an alarming $5 trillion during President Joe Biden’s term, as revealed by the U.S. Treasury and reported by the Daily Caller. By the close of Friday, the federal debt had surged to $32.8 trillion, a dramatic jump from $27.7 trillion on Biden’s inauguration day.</p>

<p>To place this into perspective, the current national debt averages out to over $250,000 per household. The uptick during the Biden administration itself constitutes an increase of more than $38,000 per household. Such financial dynamics have sparked concerns among citizens and financial experts, especially when one contrasts these figures with past administrations.</p>

<p>Historically, the increase in federal debt under Biden’s leadership doesn’t align favorably when juxtaposed with the trajectories of recent presidential tenures. Notably, the George W. Bush administration, often applauded for its fiscal restraint during the same time frame post-inauguration, witnessed a federal debt augmentation of merely $1 trillion – a figure starkly lower than Biden’s.</p>

<p>Following closely, the Trump administration, though critiqued on various fronts, saw a rise of almost $2.5 trillion during the analogous post-inauguration period. Even the Obama administration, despite inheriting the aftermath of the global financial crisis, recorded a debt ascent of just above $4 trillion during a comparable duration.</p>

<p>Compounding worries, Biden’s projected fiscal 2024 budget intimates that this upward trajectory is set to continue. The proposal paints a grim picture, forecasting a consistent annual rise in the total federal debt over the ensuing decade. If these projections come to fruition, the U.S. will be staggering under an almost $50.7 trillion debt by the end of fiscal year 2033.</p>

<p>Such fiscal developments beg the question: Is the Biden administration merely kicking the can down the road, amassing burdens for future generations? As national debts continue to mount, the economic stability and future prosperity of the nation hang in the balance.</p>
