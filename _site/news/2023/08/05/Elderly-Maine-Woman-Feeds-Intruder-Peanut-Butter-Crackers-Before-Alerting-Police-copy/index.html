  <p>In an unusual home intrusion incident in Maine, an 87-year-old woman reportedly remained calm and fed the intruder peanut butter and crackers before using her rotary phone to call the police.</p>

<p>The elderly resident, demonstrating a sense of composure that left even the responding officers in awe, reportedly didn’t panic when she found an unknown man in her home. Instead, she engaged him in conversation and offered him a snack of peanut butter and crackers.</p>

<p>“We’re not recommending that individuals engage with intruders in this manner,” a police spokesperson said. “But it seems that in this particular situation, her kindness and calm demeanor potentially diffused a potentially volatile situation.”</p>

<p>The intruder, seemingly taken aback by the woman’s calm and hospitable response, accepted the snack and engaged in a conversation with her. The woman used this opportunity to subtly reach for her rotary phone, dial 911, and quietly inform the police about the situation.</p>

<p>Once the police arrived, they apprehended the intruder without incident. The suspect is currently in custody and has been charged with breaking and entering.</p>

<p>The police, while praising the elderly woman’s bravery and composure, remind residents to prioritize their safety. “It’s best to remove yourself from the situation and call the police,” the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>As for the 87-year-old resident, she was unharmed and is reportedly doing well. Neighbors and local community members have praised her bravery, with some joking that her peanut butter and cracker serving skills may have averted a crisis.</p>
