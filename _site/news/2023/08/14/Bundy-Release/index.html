  <p>Ammon Bundy, a well-known figure in Idaho’s political and activist scene, has been released from the Gem County Jail on a $10,000 bond, according to the Idaho Statesman.</p>

<p>The former independent gubernatorial candidate found himself back in the headlines when he was arrested this past Friday evening in Emmett, Idaho. The grounds for his detention were tied to an outstanding warrant for contempt of court. The arrest took place during a fundraiser event for his son’s high school football team.</p>

<p>It was in the early hours of Sunday at 1:30 a.m. when Bundy secured his release by posting the required bond. A representative from the Gem County Sheriff’s Office relayed this information to the media.</p>

<p>The contempt charge has its roots in a previous violation where Bundy was alleged to have flouted a directive barring him from intimidating or harassing witnesses. This directive was linked to a civil lawsuit launched against him by the St. Luke’s Health System.</p>

<p>The situation gained traction on social media when a video of his arrest was disseminated via Bundy’s official X social media account the following Saturday.</p>

<p>The next legal proceeding for Bundy will be in an Ada County court, as shared by a sergeant from the Gem County Sheriff’s Office. The specific date remains uncertain, with the sheriff’s office not providing immediate details on when that might be.</p>

<p>Ammon Bundy’s notoriety rose sharply following his participation in the 2022 gubernatorial race. Although he did not secure a win, finishing third in the race, he garnered a significant share of the vote, approximately 17%, amounting to more than 100,000 votes.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of Bundy’s arrest, a “call to action” was broadcasted by members of Bundy’s People’s Rights Network. This beckoned his supporters to congregate outside the Gem County Sheriff’s Office. The public response was noticeable, with individuals either phoning the jail to get updates on Bundy’s status or arriving in person. A Gem County sheriff’s sergeant mentioned to the Statesman about the presence of individuals outside the office, without speculating on their intentions.</p>

<p>Bundy’s most publicized and controversial moment in the national spotlight came in 2016. He spearheaded an armed occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. This act of protest was directed against the federal management of public lands. The culmination of this event saw Bundy arrested, though he was eventually acquitted of all federal charges.</p>
