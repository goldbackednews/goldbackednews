  <p>Climate activists from Just Stop Oil took a hammer to more than just the glass protecting a famous piece of art at London’s National Gallery; they struck a nerve worldwide. The target of their protest was none other than the ‘Rokeby Venus’ by Diego Velázquez, a masterpiece valued at a staggering £72.5 million.</p>

<p>The activists, wielding “safety hammers,” not only smashed the protective glass of the 17th-century painting but also shattered the complacency surrounding climate discussions. Their bold actions came with a clear and thunderous message: cease new oil and gas projects to prevent looming environmental catastrophe.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time ‘Rokeby Venus’ has been at the center of political activism. Over a century ago, suffragettes, in their fight for women’s voting rights, also chose this artwork to make their statement. Echoing that sentiment, one of the protesters exclaimed, “Women did not get the vote by voting; it is time for deeds not words. It is time to Just Stop Oil.”</p>

<p>The incident has drawn a parallel between past and present struggles for change, igniting a fiery debate on whether such extreme actions are necessary or effective catalysts for political or social reform. Despite the outcry, the Just Stop Oil activists sat peacefully after their deed, symbolizing their readiness for what may come next.</p>

<p>The National Gallery responded swiftly, the room was evacuated, and the pair who attacked the painting were arrested, facing charges of criminal damage. Yet, despite the shock and potential legal consequences, the activists’ message resonates with a sense of urgency in the fight against climate change—a cause that continues to mobilize young and old across the globe.</p>

<p>In light of these events, the role of protest in society is once again under scrutiny. Is the destruction of property a legitimate form of advocacy, or does it cross a line that should not be breached? The debate rages on, with opinions as divided as ever.</p>

<p>What’s clear is that climate activism has taken a bold turn. As governments and corporations grapple with the pressing issues of our time, the voices of the people, sometimes quiet, sometimes with a hammer in hand, are echoing through the halls of history, art, and politics, reminding us that change is not always quiet, and often, it is not polite.</p>
