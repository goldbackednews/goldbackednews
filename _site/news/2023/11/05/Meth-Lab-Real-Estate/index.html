  <p>A spacious Californian home has been put up for sale at $1.5 million, but there’s a catch: the property comes with an inactive meth lab. The San Jose house, boasting six bedrooms and four bathrooms, is nestled in a coveted location with amenities such as an attached garage and outdoor pool. However, the meth lab, complete with smoke contamination, remains a startling inclusion in the otherwise appealing listing.</p>

<p>The 2,743-square-foot residence, listed by Keller Williams Realty-Silicon Valley, seems to offer a lucrative opportunity for the savvy investor or an ambitious do-it-yourself enthusiast willing to tackle the decontamination process. Buyers are cautioned, however, that the property will be sold in its current state, with the cleanup and its associated costs firmly on their shoulders.</p>

<p>This listing represents a broader trend in the Golden State, where a mix of high-priced homes and unique selling points speak to a diverse market. In recent times, California has seen a rise in residents seeking more affordable living conditions elsewhere, yet the San Jose neighborhood remains in high demand with properties averaging around $1,620,000 and typically lasting a mere five days on the market.</p>

<p>Prospective buyers are clearly informed: the house has not been cleared of contamination and will require clearance by Santa Clara County’s Health Department before it can be accessed. This means no prior inspections or walk-throughs, a stipulation that is undoubtedly causing a stir among interested parties.</p>

<p>While the listing does highlight the potential in the property, it also emphasizes that the “remediation process and subsequent costs associated” will be the responsibility of the new owner. It’s a daunting proposition, but for those looking to make a mark in San Jose’s prime real estate locale, this property might just be the diamond in the rough—or in this case, the crystal in the cache.</p>

<p>The sale of this home will likely become a landmark case study in the annals of real estate, challenging the norms of what buyers may or may not accept in their pursuit of property ownership. As the housing market continues to navigate post-pandemic conditions and fluctuating buyer expectations, unique listings like this one underscore the complex decisions and risks that come with the territory.</p>

<p>For those enticed by the challenge, the San Jose meth lab house awaits—a testament to the unpredictable nature of today’s real estate adventures.</p>
