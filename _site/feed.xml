A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/15/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-15T09:16:32-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-15T09:16:32-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/15/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/15/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">US Migrant Influx Challenges Democrat Cities: A Crisis in the Making</title><link href="/news/2023/10/15/Migrant-Crisis-US/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="US Migrant Influx Challenges Democrat Cities: A Crisis in the Making" /><published>2023-10-15T08:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-15T08:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/15/Migrant-Crisis-US</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/15/Migrant-Crisis-US/">&lt;p&gt;Amid the expansive wall marking the U.S.-Mexico divide in southern California, a significant migrant surge puts immense pressure on American cities. These new arrivals stretch local resources thin, sparking significant concerns, particularly in Democrat-led cities like San Diego, New York, and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Diego stands as a prime example of the distress this surge has caused. “The reality is that we don’t have sufficient funds,” voiced Nora Vargas, a prominent Democrat in San Diego’s governance. “As we continue to plan, the numbers continue to increase.” Consequently, the city recently declared the situation a “humanitarian crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, immigration has been a divisive issue in the U.S. politics. But the recent record-breaking influx – with reports citing a staggering 2.4 million migrant encounters at the southern border in the past year – challenges the traditional Democratic approach of welcoming all, regardless of their entry method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In San Diego, migrants, predominantly fleeing dire circumstances in Latin America, are tracked with wristbands indicating their crossing date. However, a massive backlog in the immigration system causes most to remain in limbo. They wait for years for a hearing, only to be moved from one crowded processing center to another and then to interstate buses. This pattern is consistently seen across southern U.S. border communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in Republican-led Texas, Governor Greg Abbott’s strategy has been to transport migrants to major cities like New York and Chicago, shifting the responsibility to their Democrat leadership. Mayor Eric Adams of New York, having absorbed over 100,000 migrants in a year, stated, “The president and the White House have failed this city.” The mounting crisis, estimated to cost New York nearly $5 billion, forced Adams to declare a state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois Governor JB Pritzker shared similar sentiments, remarking, “The federal government’s lack of intervention and coordination at the border has created an untenable situation for Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticism comes at a critical time, just a year before the presidential elections, painting the Biden administration in a precarious light. As American households grapple with rising living costs, the narrative that the borders are left unchecked becomes more potent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Vivar, associated with the San Diego Episcopal Diocese, highlighted the broader issue – a system ill-equipped for the current challenges. With neither political party providing a comprehensive solution, the country remains at an impasse. “Decisions are made about our border 3,000 miles away,” Vargas concluded. It’s a clear call to action, urging policymakers to witness the issues firsthand and develop tangible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amid the expansive wall marking the U.S.-Mexico divide in southern California, a significant migrant surge puts immense pressure on American cities.

This lapse in action could have potentially exposed children to the toxic gas, which is a leading cause of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the memo, shared with the “Air Force amn/nco/snco” Facebook page and confirmed authentic by the Air Force, tests from 2022 revealed toxic gas levels above the federally accepted limit in the daycare’s baby and toddler rooms. Despite the concerning readings, there were no immediate actions taken until an audit in September 2023 brought the oversight to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is undetectable to human senses. It emerges from the decay of uranium in soil, water, and rocks and can infiltrate buildings through foundation gaps. Prolonged exposure to radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer in the U.S., following smoking. The memo highlighted readings of 1.24 WLM/year in the baby room and 6.33 WLM/year in the toddler room, both of which surpass the acceptable exposure limit of 0.8 WLM/year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to control the fallout from this revelation, the base has initiated a series of actions. The civil engineering department will undertake additional testing in the facility, and rooms with concerning radon levels will be temporarily closed. Collaborations with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are in place to implement effective mitigation measures swiftly. Moreover, a prioritized medical appointment system has been established for children potentially exposed to the harmful gas, and efforts are underway to identify all potentially affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the grim nature of the findings, the Air Force seeks to reassure parents and the public. The memo stated that the risk of children developing lung cancer due to exposure at the Child Development Center is “significantly less than 1%.” However, this attempt at reassurance will likely be little consolation to families who trusted the base to provide a safe environment for their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Air Force spokesperson emphasized their commitment to rectifying the situation, stating, “It goes without saying that we take this seriously. We are implementing steps to ensure the safety of children and workers at the site.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident underscores the necessity for stringent safety checks and immediate action when potential hazards are identified, especially in facilities catering to vulnerable populations like children.

&lt;p&gt;The polling data, which paint a picture of an aging President, is reportedly causing unease among Democrats. The spotlight on Biden’s age is further intensified by focus groups, where swing voters frequently label him using terms like “old, slowing down”, or more critically as having “dementia” or being “feeble”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) recently voiced the need for the Democratic Party to address these growing apprehensions, especially with the looming possibility of a rematch against former President Donald Trump. Another vocal Senator, Jon Tester (D-MT), highlighted the undeniable reality of Biden’s age, pointing out that he would be 82 during the next election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As party members grapple with this data, there’s an overarching sentiment that President Biden hasn’t done enough to challenge these perceptions. Politico’s insights suggest that the President has shown little interest in countering the negative image that’s slowly being cemented in the public’s view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to concerns are Biden’s physical health issues. Though he suffers from atrial fibrillation, peripheral neuropathy in his feet, and hyperlipidemia, his physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, after a physical examination in February, confirmed that the President is fit to conduct presidential duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Politico’s Jonathan Martin notes certain limitations in Biden’s interactions with the media, which has a cascading effect on his public perception. Instead of directly addressing questions about the economy and public sentiment, Biden often digresses, losing potential opportunities to challenge his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst these age-related concerns, some Republicans suggest that focusing on Biden’s mental or physical capacity isn’t a fruitful strategy for the upcoming elections. They believe the spotlight should be on Biden’s policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poll results emphasize the President’s challenges, revealing approval ratings below 50% across critical issues such as inflation, immigration, crime, terrorism, and foreign affairs. With such figures in play, it’s evident that the coming months will be crucial for Biden and the Democratic Party as they strategize for the 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As President Joe Biden’s term unfolds, a growing chorus of concerns has emerged from the Democratic ranks, as recent polling suggests a majority of voters perceive him as “old, slowing down,” and even “feeble.” These worries are further fueled by the President’s age, which stands at 80, leading to skepticism about his ability to seek another term.

The AP-NORC poll, released this week, shows a significant portion of Americans questioning the President’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the participants, a substantial 68% felt that Biden might have engaged in either unethical or downright illegal actions regarding his son’s business operations. Only a mere 30% of the respondents believed that the President was entirely innocent in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at these figures shows party affiliations driving some of the perceptions. While 40% of Democratic participants expressed concerns about Biden’s possible misdeeds (with 8% thinking he acted illegally and 32% sensing unethical behavior), a whopping 96% of Republicans held reservations. Of this percentage, 65% believed that President Biden engaged in illegal activities and 35% felt he acted unethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite these alarming figures, public sentiment appears less supportive of the impeachment inquiry the GOP has initiated against Biden concerning Hunter’s business engagements. Of the polled individuals, only 33% seemed to endorse this inquiry, while 39% expressed their disapproval. Surprisingly, a significant 26% didn’t voice any opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictably, party lines play a noticeable role here too. A significant 67% of Republican respondents backed the impeachment inquiry, whereas only a tiny 7% of Democrats did the same. However, what’s noteworthy is the knowledge gap: barely 54% of respondents claimed familiarity with the ongoing impeachment process. Among these, almost half (49%) disapproved of the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst this backdrop of political intrigue and skepticism, the poll also touched upon public trust in parties to counteract government corruption. Responses were split, with 19% leaning towards the Republicans and 28% favoring the Democrats. Yet, the most telling figure might be the combined 52% who either found both parties equally reliable or didn’t trust either at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducted between October 5-9 and surveying 1,163 adults across the country, the AP-NORC poll gives an insightful glimpse into the current political climate. While the President and his son, Hunter, remain central figures in this whirlwind, the poll’s margin of error stands at +/- 3.9 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results underscore a politically charged atmosphere and highlight the pressing need for clarity, transparency, and robust democratic dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Recent poll results have ignited fresh debate around President Joe Biden’s involvement with his son Hunter Biden’s controversial business affairs. The AP-NORC poll, released this week, shows a significant portion of Americans questioning the President’s actions. Of the participants, a substantial 68% felt that Biden might have engaged in either unethical or downright illegal actions regarding his son’s business operations. Only a mere 30% of the respondents believed that the President was entirely innocent in this matter. A closer look at these figures shows party affiliations driving some of the perceptions. While 40% of Democratic participants expressed concerns about Biden’s possible misdeeds (with 8% thinking he acted illegally and 32% sensing unethical behavior), a whopping 96% of Republicans held reservations. Of this percentage, 65% believed that President Biden engaged in illegal activities and 35% felt he acted unethically. However, despite these alarming figures, public sentiment appears less supportive of the impeachment inquiry the GOP has initiated against Biden concerning Hunter’s business engagements. Of the polled individuals, only 33% seemed to endorse this inquiry, while 39% expressed their disapproval. Surprisingly, a significant 26% didn’t voice any opinion. Predictably, party lines play a noticeable role here too. A significant 67% of Republican respondents backed the impeachment inquiry, whereas only a tiny 7% of Democrats did the same. However, what’s noteworthy is the knowledge gap: barely 54% of respondents claimed familiarity with the ongoing impeachment process. Among these, almost half (49%) disapproved of the inquiry. Amidst this backdrop of political intrigue and skepticism, the poll also touched upon public trust in parties to counteract government corruption. Responses were split, with 19% leaning towards the Republicans and 28% favoring the Democrats. Yet, the most telling figure might be the combined 52% who either found both parties equally reliable or didn’t trust either at all. Conducted between October 5-9 and surveying 1,163 adults across the country, the AP-NORC poll gives an insightful glimpse into the current political climate. While the President and his son, Hunter, remain central figures in this whirlwind, the poll’s margin of error stands at +/- 3.9 percentage points. These results underscore a politically charged atmosphere and highlight the pressing need for clarity, transparency, and robust democratic dialogue.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CIA Predicted Imminent Hamas Assault, But Was Anyone Listening?</title><link href="/news/2023/10/14/CIA-Warnings-Hamas-Attack/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CIA Predicted Imminent Hamas Assault, But Was Anyone Listening?" /><published>2023-10-14T11:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-14T11:45:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/14/CIA-Warnings-Hamas-Attack</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/14/CIA-Warnings-Hamas-Attack/">&lt;p&gt;Amidst the aftermath of last week’s catastrophic attack on Israel, revelations have emerged that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had issued multiple warnings signaling a forthcoming Hamas assault. Notably, leading news outlets, The New York Times and CNN, shed light on this matter on Friday, raising pressing questions about potential intelligence oversights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With sources confirming that the CIA had delivered at least two distinct warnings in the weeks preceding the onslaught on Israel, the gravest of which came merely days prior to the event, there’s increasing scrutiny on whether these alarms were heeded. The New York Times disclosed that neither President Joe Biden nor key White House officials had been briefed on these reports, further amplifying concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These CIA assessments, particularly those dated Sept. 28 and then Oct. 5 and 6, primarily stemmed from intelligence insights provided by Israel. Whether Israel was duly informed remains uncertain. However, as the dust settles from last Saturday’s attack, launched on Oct. 7, the catastrophic results of these alerts going unheeded are starkly apparent. A staggering death toll of over 1,300 in Israel includes 27 American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Sept. 28 report had cautioned about Hamas gearing up for a series of rocket attacks on Israel, an unfortunately common event in the region’s volatile history. The subsequent reports, on Oct. 5 and 6, progressively elevated the urgency, with the latter alerting about an impending attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the gravity of the situation extends beyond these recent revelations. It emerges that Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, disclosed that Israel had also been warned by Egypt just three days ahead of the Hamas strike. The depth and specificity of that warning remain undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the recurring nature of these alerts, an intelligence source mentioned to CNN, “This is something that has historically been the norm between Hamas and Israel.” Consequently, both the U.S. and Israel now find themselves facing fierce criticism for the perceived lapse in intelligence. Despite the warnings not fully encompassing the magnitude of Hamas’ eventual brutality, they follow a concerning trend of intelligence alerts over the past year being frequently sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior Arab official, voicing the frustration echoed by many, stated, “They never listened every time we warned them.” The aftermath of the attack has been nothing short of horrific, with the scale of devastation far surpassing the expectations of even the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the backdrop of this tragedy and the emerging reports on missed warnings, the question lingers: Will this be a turning point in heeding intelligence assessments in the future?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amidst the aftermath of last week’s catastrophic attack on Israel, revelations have emerged that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had issued multiple warnings signaling a forthcoming Hamas assault.

This incident, which has caused quite a stir, once again brings the nation’s attention to the polarizing debates surrounding gun rights, public safety, and political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York City Police Department (NYPD) confirmed Vernikov’s arrest after images circulating on social media showed the butt-end of a firearm sticking out from her pants during the demonstration. The photographs, captured by attendees at the scene, rapidly spread, drawing swift reactions from both supporters and critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities apprehended Vernikov, the representative for southern Brooklyn, around 3 a.m., charging her with criminal possession of a firearm. While Vernikov is licensed to possess the firearm, New York state law dictates that firearms are prohibited in “sensitive locations,” which includes educational institutions like Brooklyn College and places where individuals gather to express their constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the negative optics, the NYPD clarified that “At no point in time was anyone menaced or injured as a result of her possessing the firearm at the earlier protest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Vernikov didn’t stay silent during the event. She uploaded a video of herself amidst the rally attendees, sharing her strong views against those supporting Hamas, going as far as to label them as “terrorists without the bombs.” This stance, coupled with the firearm controversy, has fueled heated debates across various online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of this incident extend beyond Vernikov. High-profile figures, like New York State Sen. Julia Salazar, a prominent Democratic socialist from Brooklyn, have condemned Vernikov’s alleged actions. Salazar emphasized the gravity of an elected official carrying a firearm to an educational institution, particularly during such a charged event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident brings to light the complexities of the current political and social environment, not only in New York City but across the nation. As public figures become more embroiled in controversies, the pressing question remains: How do we ensure safety and uphold the law while preserving the rights and freedoms that are intrinsic to our democracy?&lt;/p&gt;

While local governments seem to have the confidence of the majority, Congress lags far behind, with only a fraction showing trust in its ability to handle domestic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the recent Gallup poll, a whopping 67% of Americans place their trust in local governments to tackle local issues. However, when it comes to Congress, only 32% believe they can effectively address national concerns. The disparity is clear: Americans tend to lean towards their local representatives when it comes to faith in problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do other government sectors fare? State governments receive a trust score of 60% from the public, while 55% trust the American populace “as a whole” to manage the challenges facing the nation. Interestingly, the judicial branch secures a 49% trust score, closely trailed by the federal government at 44%, the executive branch at 41%, and political candidates at 40%. Congress stands at the rear, witnessing a decline of 6 points from last year’s Gallup results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key takeaway from the poll is that trust in governmental bodies has seen an overall decline since 1972. For instance, while the current 67% trust level in local governments is impressive, it’s still 3 points down from historical averages. Moreover, the judicial branch, headed by the Supreme Court, has observed the steepest decline with a drop of 17 points since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This erosion of trust in the Supreme Court may be attributed to a series of conservative-leaning decisions, notably the controversial verdict on abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallup’s findings highlight a prevailing sentiment: Americans believe local and state governments are more attuned to their needs and concerns. In a nation grappling with political divides and legislative stagnation, local bodies are perceived as more adaptable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey’s timing also offers a significant context. Conducted between September 1-23, the findings came just a week before Congress narrowly averted a governmental shutdown. Additionally, the GOP-led House is currently functioning without a speaker, intensifying uncertainties around another potential shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while local governments remain pillars of trust for most Americans, there’s an evident need for federal institutions, especially Congress, to bridge the widening trust gap. As Gallup points out, the continuous decline in confidence spells a concerning trajectory for the nation’s democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">It’s official: The latest Gallup survey reveals that trust in Congress is at its lowest ebb among American institutions.
