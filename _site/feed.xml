A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Bill Maher on Biden’s Dipping Approval: ‘Tents Everywhere &amp;amp; Locked Hair Scrunchies’</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/07/Maher-Biden-Approval-Ratings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bill Maher on Biden’s Dipping Approval: ‘Tents Everywhere &amp;amp; Locked Hair Scrunchies’" /><published>2023-10-07T12:48:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-07T12:48:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/07/Maher-Biden-Approval-Ratings</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/07/Maher-Biden-Approval-Ratings/">&lt;p&gt;Television host Bill Maher of HBO’s “Real Time” recently weighed in on President Joe Biden’s waning approval ratings. Maher attributed this decline to the stark visual of homelessness and the rise in theft cases, such as the need for store items like hair scrunchies to be locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It just doesn’t feel good when you see tents everywhere on the street,” remarked Maher, highlighting the increasing visibility of homelessness as a factor in the public’s perception of the nation’s wellbeing. The sentiment was strong: witnessing homelessness at such a scale gives a sense that “the country’s [not] right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthering his argument on the atmosphere of insecurity, Maher commented on the stringent security measures some stores have been forced to adopt due to theft. He voiced his own displeasure, “It just doesn’t feel good when I’ve got to get a sales associate to unlock the hair scrunchies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk show host’s comments reflect a broader debate surrounding law enforcement, crime rates, and societal compassion. Maher raised the question of balance, pondering the difficulty in finding a “middle ground” between liberal cities downplaying certain crimes and the aggressive approach of figures like former President Donald Trump, who once mentioned “shooting shoplifters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Isgur, ABC News Contributor and The Dispatch Editor, joined the discussion, criticizing what she termed as “luxury beliefs” held by those untouched by the direct consequences of crime. According to Isgur, such views masquerade as compassion but may indirectly promote harmful practices, such as drug cartels profiting from human smuggling or being nonchalant about rampant drug use on streets. “It’s not compassionate to tell someone that they should die on the sidewalk,” she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher concurred, drawing attention to the psychological toll such issues can have on individuals. He reiterated that these real-world situations and their direct impact on the lives of Americans might be the underlying reason for the disapproval sentiments against Biden. In his words, “Biden’s always saying, why don’t people like me more? And then they cite numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This candid exchange on Maher’s show brings to the forefront issues that many Americans face daily. The conversation underscores the importance of addressing pressing societal challenges, like homelessness and theft, that may significantly influence political approval ratings and public sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Television host Bill Maher of HBO’s “Real Time” recently weighed in on President Joe Biden’s waning approval ratings.

Recent polling data reveals Trump’s lead over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has surged by a staggering 20 points nationally in just over two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dramatic shift was highlighted by a recent poll published on Wednesday, showcasing Trump’s support among registered Republicans and independents who lean Republican at 56%. This marks a 10-point increase from July’s Marquette poll, which pegged him at 46%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, DeSantis experienced a drop in support, losing ten points since July. The Florida Governor now garners only 12% of the support, indicating a significant shift in the political landscape within the Republican camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times further highlighted DeSantis’s challenges, noting the campaign’s decision to relocate a third of its staff to Iowa and its current financial status. DeSantis’s campaign war chest for GOP primary purposes stands at a concerning $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican field remains diverse, with Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, not far behind DeSantis at six percent. Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, and former Vice President Mike Pence share fourth place, each holding four percent of the support. Interestingly, Ramaswamy witnessed a three-point increase from July, while Pence saw a three percent decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this political poll mix, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) also made appearances, holding two percent and one percent support, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marquette University provided further food for thought by examining a hypothetical election match-up between Trump and current President Joe Biden. Results fluctuated based on the voter sample. Among registered voters, Trump led by a slight margin, while Biden had a minuscule advantage among likely voters. Both scenarios present statistical ties, keeping the political waters murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these developments, it’s evident that the political tides are shifting, re-establishing Trump’s dominance within the Republican sphere and placing DeSantis on unsure footing.

The incursion marked a significant escalation in the conflict between the two territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, rockets flew from the Gaza Strip, hitting regions of southern Israel. The assault, which Hamas has proudly taken responsibility for, has led to over 100 Israelis losing their lives. The conflict’s gravity deepened as Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, dubbed the attack “the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.” He called on Palestinians everywhere to confront Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retaliation, Israeli air strikes took the lives of 198 Palestinians, Gaza health officials confirmed. The wave of attacks has overwhelmed hospitals, which are currently treating nearly 985 injured individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message, explicitly stated, “Citizens of Israel, we are at war.” Ambulance crews raced to regions around the Gaza Strip, while sirens warned residents across Israel. Hospital reports indicate hundreds of wounded, including civilians, signaling the broad reach of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gunmen have targeted civilians in Israeli towns, with video footage capturing confrontations in city streets. The Israeli military commented, “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” urging residents near the Gaza border to stay indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson firmly condemned the unprovoked attacks. She stressed, “There is never any justification for terrorism,” reaffirming America’s allegiance to Israel. European leaders, too, stood in solidarity with Israel, denouncing Hamas’s actions. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union’s executive commission, labeled the attack as “terrorism in its most despicable form,” asserting Israel’s right to self-defense. Prominent European heads of state echoed this sentiment, highlighting their strong support for Israel during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While confrontations between Israel and Gaza are not unprecedented, the recent surge in aggression is unparalleled. With the Israeli defense establishment making strategic evaluations and preparations, the conflict, which started with Hamas’s surprise attacks on Saturday, is anticipated to extend for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

The crux? Trump’s most prized assets, including the iconic Trump Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to delay the trial, Trump’s legal team is challenging a court ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron, which could spell the dissolution of companies controlling some of Trump’s major assets. The gravity of this ruling suggests a court-appointed receiver might oversee Trump’s businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing attention, Trump lawyers Clifford Robert, Michael Farina, and Michael Madaio penned a 41-page appellate brief, describing the potential havoc Engoron’s verdict could bring. They emphasized the “severe and irreparable harm” not just to Trump and the defendants but also to countless employees relying on those businesses for their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backdrop is set with the appellate court already dismissing a previous attempt to delay the trial, mere days before its commencement. Adding to the evolving scenario, Trump’s legal representatives withdrew a lawsuit against Judge Engoron last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, remains steadfast. James’ office conveyed their openness to discuss enforcing Engoron’s verdict post-trial. However, they desire the trial to persist without interruptions. Senior Assistant Solicitor General Dennis Fan argued against abruptly halting the trial, citing the logistical intricacies, security arrangements, and potential inconvenience to scheduled witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revealing an intriguing turn of events, Engoron concluded last week that Trump engaged in fraudulent activities while establishing his real estate empire. This verdict stems from James’ lawsuit that accused Trump of deceiving various stakeholders by inflating the value of his assets in annual financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, however, rebuts these allegations, contending that many of his assets are undervalued in those statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring clarity, Engoron delineated the procedures for enforcing his ruling last Thursday. He allocated deadlines for both parties to suggest potential receivers and directed Trump and the defendants to inform a court-appointed monitor about the entities affected by his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant directive also mandated the defendants to notify the monitor before applying for new business licenses or trying to form new entities that might inherit the assets of a dissolving company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s attorneys, though, counter-argue that Engoron’s decision lacks a coherent legal basis, dubbing it as “the corporate death penalty.” They further criticize the judge for ambiguity in elucidating the real-world implications of his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier pretrial hearing, another Trump lawyer, Christopher Kise, sought clarity from Engoron on the extent of the ruling’s impact on Trump’s assets. Engoron, however, deferred his response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing their appeal, Trump’s legal team underscores their concerns about the far-reaching consequences of Engoron’s “overbroad directive,” emphasizing its potential to usher in “confusion and chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;

The power couple now faces a federal indictment linked to a bribery scheme spanning multiple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hefty allegations trace back to a seemingly opulent lifestyle: a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible, bars of gold, and an influx of hard cash. With these revelations, it’s no wonder that Sen. Menendez recently resigned from his esteemed position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This isn’t his first rendezvous with the law either. Back in 2016, he was indicted on similar bribery charges, a case that eventually resulted in his acquittal in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story unfolds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2018, Arslanian starts her romantic journey with Menendez. It’s during this time that Menendez becomes acquainted with businessman Wael Hana. Hana’s close ties with Egyptian officials, coupled with connections to New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes and insurance expert Jose Uribe, become central to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2018 to 2022, Menendez and Arslanian allegedly receive a myriad of bribes from their new circle: gold bars, substantial cash amounts, a luxury Mercedes-Benz, mortgage payments, and home furnishings. The indictment even claims Menendez leaked sensitive U.S. government intel to Egyptian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, Daibes faces federal charges. However, two months later, Arslanian finds herself in the limelight after fatally hitting a pedestrian. Curiously, she was quickly released without a DUI test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2019, Uribe extends an offer to purchase a new Mercedes-Benz for the couple following Arslanian’s tragic accident. Menendez, in return, allegedly seeks to influence an investigation involving Uribe. Hana’s business then steps in, settling Arslanian’s house mortgage. Menendez is also said to have leveraged his influence to protect Hana’s business interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2020 to 2022, Menendez allegedly agrees to manipulate the prosecution of Daibes in a quid pro quo involving cash, gold, and furniture. By June 2022, an FBI raid at the Menendez residence unveils over half a million dollars in cash and multiple gold bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, charges are officially brought against both Arslanian and Menendez. Despite the growing clamor for his resignation, Menendez remains steadfast, pleading not guilty to all accusations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Menendez’s career now hangs in the balance, with the weight of years-long alleged corruption casting a long shadow.

In September 2023, charges are officially brought against both Arslanian and Menendez. Despite the growing clamor for his resignation, Menendez remains steadfast, pleading not guilty to all accusations. Senator Menendez’s career now hangs in the balance, with the weight of years-long alleged corruption casting a long shadow. Only time will reveal the ultimate fate of one of New Jersey’s most prominent political figures.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">US Forces Neutralize Turkish Drone: Rising Tensions in Syria</title><link href="/news/2023/10/06/Turkish-Drone-Downed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="US Forces Neutralize Turkish Drone: Rising Tensions in Syria" /><published>2023-10-06T17:51:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-06T17:51:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/06/Turkish-Drone-Downed</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/06/Turkish-Drone-Downed/">&lt;p&gt;In a developing situation that highlights the complexities of the Syrian arena, US Armed Forces shot down a Turkish drone close to an American base in northeast Syria. The incident, confirmed by the Pentagon, occurred near Hasakah and was a direct response to the drone being perceived as a “potential threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin communicated with his Turkish counterpart, Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, emphasizing both nations’ joint commitment to defeating ISIS and ensuring regional stability. Despite the collapse of the ISIS “caliphate” in Raqqa in 2017, the US continues its military presence in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent actions, Turkey commenced aerial bombings in both Syria and Iraq on October 1. This move came in retaliation to an attempted suicide bombing in Ankara, claimed by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a US-designated terrorist group. The Turkish administration, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has asserted that these airstrikes aimed to dismantle PKK bases and resources. However, Turkey broadly categorizes several Kurdish factions in Syria and Iraq, some of which are US allies, under the same PKK label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This backdrop brings into context the Turkish drone’s proximity to the American outpost. Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder highlighted the immediate threat the drone posed, leading to the necessary defense action by US F-16 fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US views this as a regrettable but necessary measure, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency did not discuss the drone’s downing. However, the Turkish media did acknowledge their defense operations’ success in Syria, emphasizing the destruction of multiple PKK targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s growing concern on the ground. Reports from Kurdish news sources indicate that recent Turkish bombings in Syrian Kurdistan led to civilian casualties. Farhad Shami, head of the SDF media center, condemned Turkey’s targeting of infrastructure and public service facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident underscores the volatile dynamics in Syria, involving a matrix of actors with overlapping alliances and conflicting objectives. With US forces primarily in Syria to combat the ISIS threat, situations like these drone incidents emphasize the necessity for clear communication and cooperation between regional players to avoid unnecessary escalations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a developing situation that highlights the complexities of the Syrian arena, US Armed Forces shot down a Turkish drone close to an American base in northeast Syria.

Wang, once the chief technical officer of FTX, openly admitted to collaborating with ex-FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, in committing multiple counts of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailing the extent of the malfeasance, Wang revealed, “Wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud.” This admission, coming from a core member of the FTX leadership, has sent shockwaves across the crypto community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/12/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-arrest-getty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sam Bankman-Fried escorted by police&quot; /&gt;(MARIO DUNCANSON/AFP via Getty Images)

&lt;p&gt;Elevating the intrigue surrounding the case, Wang is highlighted as one of the prosecution’s ace witnesses. He shed light on the involvement of other key FTX leaders, including Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh. Ellison, known to have a close personal relationship with Bankman-Fried, helmed Alameda Research, a hedge fund closely affiliated with FTX. Singh, a prominent FTX engineer, and Ellison have both accepted their involvement in the alleged illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang’s testimonies further unveiled the intricate ties between FTX and Alameda Research. He stated, “We extended exclusive benefits to Alameda Research, enabling them to extract unrestricted funds from FTX. Unfortunately, these actions were misrepresented to our user base.” Alarmingly, Wang confessed that Alameda had borrowed a staggering $8 billion from FTX—funds that originally belonged to FTX’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case unfolds, Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO and a notable Democrat donor, faces seven severe charges, including fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. These allegations revolve around Bankman-Fried’s purported misuse of FTX customer assets to compensate for Alameda Research’s financial deficits. Additionally, he is accused of channeling these funds for personal real estate acquisitions and other individual expenditures. Despite the weight of these allegations, Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence, pleading not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he stares down the possibility of an astounding 110-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent development, Bankman-Fried’s defense counsel presented their perspective, portraying the former CEO as a dedicated “math nerd” who led an austere life. They stated, “Sam was not involved in any theft. Instead, he genuinely believed that the loans FTX provided to Alameda were fully legitimate, backed by substantial security and collateral.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this high-stakes trial progresses, it promises more twists and turns, holding the cryptocurrency world in rapt attention. The outcomes could set significant precedents for future crypto-related legal cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a gripping courtroom drama, Gary Wang, co-founder of the controversial cryptocurrency exchange FTX, dropped bombshell testimonies on Thursday.

Judge Aileen Cannon granted a delay in a pre-trial filing deadline, providing Trump’s legal team with additional time in the case related to the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This significant decision arrived shortly after Trump’s team requested the judge to defer his classified documents trial to a date post the 2024 presidential election. The current date set for this trial is May 20 in Florida, while the general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this high-profile case is the accusation that Trump illicitly stockpiled classified documents during his presidency. However, Trump, standing firm, has refuted all allegations of misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting potential scheduling conflicts as a primary reason for the requested delay, Trump’s attorneys mentioned another criminal trial scheduled for March 4, 2023. They emphasized the challenge of managing overlapping trial schedules, particularly when Trump and his lawyers would be required to be present in different locations simultaneously. This brings to light the demanding logistics of managing multiple legal fronts for the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional point of contention raised by Trump’s legal representatives revolves around delays in acquiring classified evidence. This evidence, under the jurisdiction of special counsel Jack Smith’s office, has been acknowledged but not entirely handed over to Trump’s team. The lawyers stress the importance of thoroughly reviewing all discovery items before proceeding with the CIPA litigation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, weighed in on the situation, explaining to Salon that Trump’s attorneys are strategically employing CIPA to buy time. The goal? To ensure they have all the evidence at hand and subsequently lay the groundwork for a strong defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As political observers keep a close eye on this case, it’s evident that the stakes are high. With the 2024 elections around the corner, the outcome of this trial could have profound implications for Trump’s political future. Moreover, this case has further intensified the national conversation around the handling and protection of classified information by officials at the highest level of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, as both sides prepare for the eventual courtroom battle, the nation will be watching intently, anticipating how this legal saga might impact the broader political landscape of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump experienced a legal victory on Friday, obtaining a delay in the upcoming classified documents trial.

&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview set to air on CNN with Christiane Amanpour, Clinton speculated on the possible nomination of Trump by the GOP in the upcoming 2024 elections. She firmly believed that the current president, Joe Biden, holds the capability to best Trump in a head-to-head battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton did not mince words when discussing the dynamics within the Republican Party. Highlighting past disagreements on topics like gun control, climate change, taxes, and the economy, she expressed concern over the current trajectory of the party. According to Clinton, an “extremist” faction within the GOP, heavily influenced by Trump, is shifting the party’s focus and direction. She lamented, “There wasn’t this little tail of extremism wagging the dog of the Republican Party as it is today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tensions continue to simmer, Clinton did not shy away from direct criticism of Trump. She emphasized his diminishing credibility and highlighted his entanglements in various legal actions, both civil and criminal. Furthermore, she posed a thought-provoking question, wondering when party members might begin distancing themselves from the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her detailed critique, Clinton posed a comparative analysis of Biden and Trump, insinuating a stark contrast between their approaches and impacts. While she lauded Biden for his accomplishments and effectiveness in office, she presented Trump as a direct threat to the foundation of American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ousting of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also emerged as a topic of discussion. Clinton denounced the conservatives responsible for the vote leading to his removal. She attributed McCarthy’s removal to his collaboration with Democrats on a 45-day continuing resolution designed to maintain governmental operations. Highlighting Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who has gained Trump’s endorsement for the Speaker position, Clinton described him as one of the main orchestrators of the GOP’s ongoing political “circus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her concluding remarks, Clinton expressed hope that the influence of a “small group of extremists” within the GOP would face challenges and resistance. As for who might rise to that challenge, she remained optimistic about the emergence of a unifying figure within the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to Clinton’s comments, MAGA Inc. spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt issued a statement emphasizing Trump’s perspective. She reiterated the belief that critics like Clinton target Trump mainly to undermine his vast supporter base. Leavitt further projected confidence in the potential re-election of Trump in 2024, proclaiming him the “47th President of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these escalating exchanges, the political landscape appears more polarized than ever, setting the stage for a fiercely contested 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Tensions flared as Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential campaign rival to former President Donald Trump, made controversial remarks suggesting a “formal deprogramming” for Trump’s supporters, whom she labeled as “cult members.” The comments have ignited swift reactions from MAGA Inc., the super PAC supporting Trump.
