A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/31/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-31T06:18:23-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T06:18:23-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/31/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/31/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">George Soros-Backed DA Pamela Price Faces Irony of Crime in Oakland</title><link href="/news/2023/10/31/George-Soros-Backed-DA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="George Soros-Backed DA Pamela Price Faces Irony of Crime in Oakland" /><published>2023-10-31T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T06:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/31/George-Soros-Backed-DA</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/31/George-Soros-Backed-DA/">&lt;p&gt;In a cruel twist of irony, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, a beneficiary of George Soros’s deep pockets, recently found herself at the mercy of the very crime wave she is accused of enabling. Last Friday, in broad daylight and the heart of crime-ridden Oakland, Price’s work laptop was stolen right out of her vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred near a family justice center, a supposed safe space, revealing the extent of lawlessness that has gripped Oakland. Price’s bodyguard, despite driving a $90,000 county Tahoe SUV, could do nothing but watch as the thieves made off with vital equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disturbing event raises critical questions about Price’s capability and willingness to tackle the rampant crime in Oakland, the largest city in her jurisdiction. Since her election in 2022, backed by none other than leftist billionaire George Soros, crime in Oakland has skyrocketed. Her soft-on-crime policies, a hallmark of Soros-backed district attorneys, have created an environment where criminals operate with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oakland’s descent into chaos can be traced back to the city’s embrace of the “Defund the Police” movement. Former Mayor Libby Schaaf led the charge, advocating for not just defunding, but replacing the police. The city even went as far as to abolish its school police department. These radical moves have left residents and law enforcement demoralized and defenseless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price’s response to this lawlessness? In a stunning display of disconnect, she claimed to feel safe living in East Oakland, a statement that flies in the face of the experiences of countless residents and victims of crime. These residents, once hopeful, are now disillusioned, living in fear in what they describe as a failed progressive utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even law enforcement is feeling the pressure, with police encouraging residents to use air horns to deter thieves. Meanwhile, Price’s response to the crime spree, her stolen laptop, and the recall filed against her in August remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the theft of Price’s laptop is not just a personal loss; it is a symbolic representation of the failed policies and lack of leadership that have left Oakland in disarray. It serves as a stark reminder to conservatives everywhere of the dangers of Soros-backed officials and the high price of progressive, soft-on-crime policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident should serve as a wake-up call for voters in Oakland and across the country. The need for strong, law-and-order leadership has never been more apparent, and the time for accountability is now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a cruel twist of irony, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, a beneficiary of George Soros’s deep pockets, recently found herself at the mercy of the very crime wave she is accused of enabling.

Her wrists and ankles were bound, and her body bore the brutal marks of a violent altercation. This gruesome discovery has sent shockwaves through the community, as authorities and loved ones alike scramble for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maleesa Mooney, a shining star with a promising career in both modeling and real estate, was last seen alive on surveillance footage in her apartment complex on September 6. Six days later, her lifeless body was discovered by the police, responding to a welfare check requested by her distraught family. They had been unable to reach Mooney for over 24 hours, sparking concerns for her safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the police and building management accessed her residence at the Bunker Hill Towers Apartments, they were met with a horrifying scene. Mooney’s body was wedged inside her refrigerator, severely beaten, and with a gag made of clothing stuffed in her mouth. Electrical cords and clothing bound her extremities. Blood was found outside the refrigerator, and the apartment bore signs of a violent struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autopsy report, released last Friday, confirmed the brutal nature of Mooney’s demise. She had suffered from blunt force trauma, evidenced by abrasions, lacerations, contusions, and a fractured rib. While none of the injuries were acutely life-threatening on their own, the examiner noted that they indicated a violent physical altercation prior to her death. Suffocation may have played a role, and traces of cocaine were found in her system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the intensive ongoing investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, the man seen entering Mooney’s apartment remains unidentified, and no arrests have been made. The authorities have not publicly named any suspects, leaving the community and Mooney’s family in a state of anguish and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maleesa Mooney is remembered by her sister, Jourdin Pauline, as “the most amazing girl ever,” a sentiment echoed by all who knew her. Mooney, who was in the process of closing deals on million-dollar homes, is described as kind-hearted, intelligent, and genuinely caring. Her tragic and untimely death has left a void in the hearts of her family, friends, and the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these trying times, the call for justice grows louder. Mooney’s family and friends have taken to social media, using the hashtag #JUSTICEFORMALEESA, to demand answers and action. The community stands united in their grief, urging anyone with information to come forward and assist in solving this heinous crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of this tragedy, it is vital to remember Maleesa Mooney for the vibrant life she lived, and ensure that every effort is made to bring her killer to justice. The authorities must relentlessly pursue the truth, ensuring that justice is served and that Mooney’s family can find some semblance of peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">A 31-year-old freelance model and real estate agent, Maleesa Mooney, was found dead inside her refrigerator last month.

Byron Donalds has accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI of repeatedly obstructing federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania from conducting investigations into President Joe Biden and his family. During a recent appearance on “Newsline,” Donalds disclosed that the House Judiciary Committee had received testimony indicating that these federal agencies had interfered in probes related to the Biden family’s business dealings at least 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intervention apparently came from high-ranking officials situated at the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the main Department of Justice office. This startling information raises questions about the transparency and impartiality of these esteemed federal institutions, casting a shadow over their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donalds further highlighted a specific instance involving a check from President Biden’s brother, James, amounting to a $200,000 loan repayment to the President himself. This financial transaction, according to Donalds, establishes a direct link between President Biden and the business transactions executed by James Biden and Hunter Biden with foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Florida Representative emphasized the importance of scrutinizing James Biden’s involvement in these dealings, asserting that the public’s focus should extend beyond Hunter Biden. He raised concerns regarding the absence of written loan agreements between the President and his brother, suggesting that this could be indicative of tax evasion practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Donalds assured that the investigation into these matters would persist, with a commitment to holding the administration accountable. “Our investigation is going to continue. We’re going to get to the bottom of this and hold this administration accountable,” he affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these allegations, the White House and the DOJ have been on the defensive. The White House has dismissed the committee’s efforts as a mere distraction tactic by “Extreme House Republicans,” accusing them of attempting to shift attention away from their own governance failures and impending government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They criticized the hearing as a circus filled with disinformation, aimed solely at undermining President Biden and his family. The White House maintains that the real crisis lies with the House Republicans’ chaotic governance, for which they should bear the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

George Santos (R-NY) from Congress, making it one of the rarest occurrences in U.S. political history. CNN’s Manu Raju reported on “News Central” that the Republicans believe they are on the verge of securing the two-thirds majority required for expulsion, with a vote expected to take place later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States House of Representatives has only witnessed the expulsion of five members throughout its existence, highlighting the gravity of this situation. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) expressed a strong sentiment outside the Capitol, stating, “We’re getting two thirds. There seems to be a good sentiment out there that enough is enough.” He emphasized the disappointment and frustration with Santos, citing his fraudulent activities and manipulation of donors over the past year or longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Marcus Molinaro (R-NY) also voiced his concerns, asserting that it is “absolutely inappropriate” for Santos to continue serving in his position. He highlighted the bipartisan support for this move, acknowledging some hesitance but underlining the clear case against Santos and his deceitful actions to attain his current office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing momentum, Speaker Johnson has expressed his lack of support for the expulsion effort, noting that Santos has not been convicted yet. Raju also pointed out that two censure resolutions are on the table, one against Rashida Tlaib and another against Marjorie Taylor Greene. However, there is opposition against both measures, and their future remains uncertain. Johnson himself conveyed his disapproval of the tit-for-tat censure resolutions during a private conference call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this political drama unfolds in the days ahead, the nation’s eyes are fixed on Congress, waiting to see if history will be made with the expulsion of George Santos. The situation not only reflects the internal workings of the Republican Party but also underscores the broader issues of trust, accountability, and integrity within the political realm.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">New York Republican House members are rallying to potentially expel Rep. George Santos (R-NY) from Congress, making it one of the rarest occurrences in U.S. political history. CNN’s Manu Raju reported on “News Central” that the Republicans believe they are on the verge of securing the two-thirds majority required for expulsion, with a vote expected to take place later this week. The United States House of Representatives has only witnessed the expulsion of five members throughout its existence, highlighting the gravity of this situation. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) expressed a strong sentiment outside the Capitol, stating, “We’re getting two thirds. There seems to be a good sentiment out there that enough is enough.” He emphasized the disappointment and frustration with Santos, citing his fraudulent activities and manipulation of donors over the past year or longer. Rep. Marcus Molinaro (R-NY) also voiced his concerns, asserting that it is “absolutely inappropriate” for Santos to continue serving in his position.

This move marks a significant escalation in the country’s military capabilities, but it also raises important questions about the world’s future in terms of nuclear armament and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a press release issued earlier this week, the Department of Defense outlined their plans for the B61-13, a modern iteration of the B61 nuclear gravity bomb. John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, emphasized that this development is a direct response to a changing security environment and the emerging threats posed by potential adversaries. He underscored the United States’ obligation to continually assess and adapt its capabilities to ensure a credible deterrence strategy, as well as to uphold its commitments to allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The B61-13 is projected to have a similar yield to the B61-7, boasting a maximum yield of 360 kilotons. To put this in perspective, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II had a yield of approximately 15 kilotons, making the B61-13 about 24 times more powerful. Furthermore, it would be approximately 14 times larger than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Despite its formidable power, the Pentagon assures that the B61-13 will incorporate the latest safety, security, and accuracy features, akin to those found in the B61-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This news comes amid escalating global tensions and following a high-explosive experiment conducted by the U.S. at a nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials state that these tests are integral to advancing nuclear nonproliferation goals and enhancing the country’s ability to detect underground nuclear explosive tests. However, the timing of this announcement, coupled with Russia’s anticipated withdrawal from the 1966 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has reignited fears of a potential nuclear arms race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon is clear in its statement that, if approved, the B61-13 would not result in an increase in the overall number of nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile; instead, it would serve to replace some of the existing B61-7s. Plumb reiterated that this development represents a measured and necessary step in addressing the challenges of an increasingly unpredictable and dynamic security environment, providing the U.S. with greater flexibility while maintaining a responsible approach to nuclear armament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world grapples with the implications of this development, the debate continues over the necessity, ethics, and potential risks associated with possessing such an unparalleled level of destructive power. The path forward remains uncertain, and the discourse on global security and the future of nuclear weaponry is more crucial than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The Pentagon’s recent announcement of its intention to develop a nuclear bomb 24 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima has sent shockwaves around the globe, stirring a pot of controversial debate and critical reflection.

This time, it’s due to her clothing brand SKIMS’ latest product – a faux-nipple bra. While Kardashian is no stranger to making bold statements through fashion, many are questioning whether this latest stunt has taken things a step too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a promotional video laden with cheeky commentary and a nod to global warming, Kardashian introduces “The SKIMS Ultimate Nipple Bra,” a bra designed to make women appear as though they are perpetually cold. The bra features built-in faux nipples, ensuring visibility regardless of the weather. “Some days are hard. But these nipples are harder. And unlike the icebergs, these aren’t going anywhere,” Kardashian quips in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kardashian may view this as a bold and innovative fashion statement, it’s hard to ignore the potential negative implications. The product has been criticized for objectifying women, reducing them to body parts for shock value and attention. Additionally, the tasteless humor surrounding a global crisis like climate change has left many shaking their heads, wondering if there are no longer any boundaries left to cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to launch the product on Halloween also adds a layer of skepticism. Is this just a seasonal stunt, aimed at capturing attention during a time known for costumes and risqué attire? Or is it a genuine attempt at innovation in the fashion industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Kardashian’s decision to tie the product to global warming seems misplaced and opportunistic. In the video, she states, “I’m not a scientist, but I do believe everyone can use their skill set to do their part.” However, many are questioning how selling a faux-nipple bra contributes to the fight against climate change, or if it’s simply a ploy to draw attention and controversy – something Kardashian is all too familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that this latest move by Kardashian and SKIMS is indicative of a larger issue within celebrity culture, where shock value and controversy often trump taste and social responsibility. The faux-nipple bra, while certainly attention-grabbing, raises questions about the lengths to which celebrities will go to stay relevant, and the impact of such stunts on societal standards and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the product prepares to hit the shelves, the court of public opinion is in session. Whether the SKIMS Ultimate Nipple Bra will be seen as a bold fashion statement or a tasteless stunt remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear – Kardashian has once again ignited a conversation, though perhaps not for the reasons she intended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Kim Kardashian, a name synonymous with controversy and boundary-pushing, is once again at the center of public discourse.

Rob Estes, a Kansas Republican, took President Joe Biden to task for what he views as a series of critical failures in international relations, tying them directly to a trifecta of global crises. Estes, in his candid conversation on Newsmax’s “Saturday Agenda,” did not mince words, painting a picture of an administration fraught with weakness and a lack of strategic foresight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghanistan debacle stands as a glaring testament to Biden’s incapacity to lead, according to Estes. The chaotic withdrawal, he argues, broadcasted a message of vulnerability that reverberated across the globe, emboldening the likes of Russia and Iran, and resulting in devastating humanitarian crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Biden’s mismanagement in Afghanistan was a clear signal to world leaders like Putin that the U.S. was retreating from its position of strength,” Estes declared, connecting the dots between the administration’s blunders and the emboldened stance of adversarial nations. He underscored the severity of these blunders, pointing out the direct line between Biden’s failures and the atrocities unfolding before the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estes’ criticism extended beyond the international arena, as he also tackled the dysfunction evident in domestic politics. He described the election of Speaker Mike Johnson as a “messy process,” a symptom of the broader disarray within the government. Despite acknowledging Johnson’s commitment to doing the right thing, Estes could not help but highlight the ways in which the administration’s failures have permeated every level of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his call to action, Estes underscored the dire need for strong, decisive leadership, the kind that seems to be sorely lacking in the current administration. He pinpointed inflation, government overspending, border insecurity, and the need to stand with Israel as pressing issues that require immediate and unwavering attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For conservative readers and those frustrated with the direction in which the country is headed, Estes’ words resonate deeply. His critique of Biden is not just a denunciation of past actions; it is a rallying cry for a return to strength, accountability, and principled leadership. The Biden administration’s failures on the world stage are not just abstract policies gone awry; they are, as Estes highlights, a direct threat to American security and global stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a no-holds-barred critique, Rep.
