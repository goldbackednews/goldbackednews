A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Standoff at Capitol Hill - Trump Provokes GOP to Use Shutdown as Leverage</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Standoff at Capitol Hill - Trump Provokes GOP to Use Shutdown as Leverage" /><published>2023-09-22T15:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-22T15:08:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown/">&lt;p&gt;With the tides of politics swirling, former President Donald Trump steps into the current fray, encouraging the Republican party to use potential government shutdowns as leverage against the policies of the current administration led by President Joe Biden. This confrontation is bringing to light the battle lines drawn within the GOP, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces internal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiscal-stalemate&quot;&gt;Fiscal Stalemate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal strife within the GOP is marked by fiscal debates, as conservative demands for individual appropriation bills clash with the broader party agenda. Trump’s recent involvement in this dispute emphasizes his enduring influence within the party, as he urges Republicans to “defund all aspects” of what he calls a “weaponized Government” under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-rallying-cry&quot;&gt;Trump’s Rallying Cry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump argued that the Republicans “can and must” obstruct Biden’s policies, depicting the current administration as hostile and accusing it of treating “half the Country as Enemies of the State.” Trump insists this is the opportune moment for Republicans to retaliate against what he perceives as political prosecutions aimed at him and other conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOP’s internal discord is heightened by figures like Rep. Matt Gaetz, a known critic of McCarthy, who echoes Trump’s calls for Republicans to hold firm against the continuing resolution (C.R.) to maintain government funding at existing levels. This presents an additional challenge to McCarthy’s attempts at holding together differing factions within the party, amidst growing pressure and opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminders of the longest government shutdown in history, stretching over Christmas break from December 2018 to January 2019 under Trump’s administration, hang heavily over these debates. The protracted battle then was over Trump’s sought-after border wall funding, which the Republicans struggled to secure against Democratic opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Earth Species Project, believes that we are nearing a time when having “conversations” with animals will be feasible. He envisions a future where understanding expressions of ‘grief’, ‘mother’, or ‘hunger’ will be common across different species.&lt;/p&gt;

A formal letter from the UK Parliament’s Culture, Media, and Sports Committee Chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, asked Rumble whether it planned to demonetize comedian and commentator Russell Brand’s channel following serious allegations of rape and sexual assault against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parliaments-appeal-and-rumbles-stance&quot;&gt;Parliament’s Appeal and Rumble’s Stance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to Rumble came in the wake of YouTube’s decision to demonetize Brand’s account. The UK Parliament expressed concerns over Brand profiting from content on Rumble amidst the grave accusations and inquired about Rumble’s intentions regarding Brand’s ability to earn money on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Rumble issued a staunch response, refusing to demonetize Brand’s channel and labelled the Parliament’s letter as “disturbing”. They defended their stance on the grounds of upholding free speech and the principle that every individual is entitled to a full and serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rumble stands for very different values. We have devoted ourselves to the vital cause of defending a free internet – meaning an internet where no one arbitrarily dictates which ideas can or cannot be heard, or which citizens may or may not be entitled to a platform,” Rumble said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-allegations-against-brand&quot;&gt;The Allegations Against Brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple women have accused Russell Brand of rape and sexual assault, as reported by Channel 4 news network and the Sunday Times in Britain. Brand, however, has vehemently denied all the allegations against him. These serious accusations have led various platforms to review their relationships with Brand, and some, like YouTube, to take decisive action against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-implications-and-repercussions&quot;&gt;Wider Implications and Repercussions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumble argues that the allegations against Brand, which are yet to be proven in a court of law, are not related to his video content, and it is “deeply inappropriate and dangerous” for the UK Parliament to attempt to control who is allowed to speak on their platform or to earn a living from doing so. They highlighted the absence of any connection between the allegations and his content on Rumble as a significant factor in their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok and other media outlets, including the BBC, Channel 4, and GB News, have also been approached by the committee for clarification on their positions regarding Brand and his ability to monetize his posts, especially those related to the allegations against him.&lt;/p&gt;

She has endorsed several candidates in Senate races and even thrown her weight behind Mayor Trent Staggs of Riverton, Utah, and businessman Bernie Moreno in Ohio, portraying her as a significant figure in the Republican realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fight-for-arizona&quot;&gt;The Fight for Arizona&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early polls suggest Lake could be a leading contender in a hypothetical Republican primary. She faces potential competition from figures like Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and businessman Blake Masters. On the Democrat side, Congressman Ruben Gallego is considered the front-runner, with current independent Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s intentions still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;controversy-and-allegations&quot;&gt;Controversy and Allegations&lt;/h2&gt;

She faces potential competition from figures like Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and businessman Blake Masters. On the Democrat side, Congressman Ruben Gallego is considered the front-runner, with current independent Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s intentions still unclear. Controversy and Allegations Lake’s earlier gubernatorial run was marked by controversy, as she maintained the presence of significant voter fraud which favored the Democrats. Her stance on such contentious issues and her alignment with Trump’s viewpoints might impact her appeal to the moderate voters in the critical swing state of Arizona. Lake’s National Ascendancy The strategic endeavors of Kari Lake reflect her ambitious goals and the broader Republican objective to regain control over both the Senate and the White House. Her increasing national presence and her alignment with Donald Trump underscore her determination to elevate the conservative agenda. The anticipation surrounding her potential Senate run is soaring, and the political circuits are abuzz, waiting to see how her strategies and alliances shape the course of the upcoming electoral battles.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Surge in the Race - Sen.

Tim Scott of South Carolina, a hopeful candidate for the White House from the Republican party, has managed to amass an impressive $1 million in campaign contributions within a mere 24 hours. This substantial windfall was revealed by a spokesperson from Scott’s campaign during his speaking engagements in New York City and Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;newfound-momentum&quot;&gt;Newfound Momentum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fundraising achievement could indicate a possible surge in momentum for Sen. Scott, who, until now, had been trailing behind some of his fellow competitors in national polling data. Scott’s campaign is seemingly catching speed, and his performance in the polls in Iowa—a state known for its pivotal role in determining the fate of presidential candidates—is promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eyes-on-the-prize&quot;&gt;Eyes on the Prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the second Republican debate looming, this spike in contributions is particularly crucial. The debate is seen as a golden opportunity for GOP presidential aspirants to position themselves as the alternative to former President Donald Trump, who is currently the front-runner by a significant margin. Trump, however, has chosen not to participate in this debate, opting instead to speak at an event in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott’s spokesperson, Matt Gorman, emphasized that Scott is ready to return to the debate stage to highlight the serious policy distinctions between the candidates, conveying that, “Tim is prepared to have a conversation with voters, be the adult in the room, and demonstrate why he is the strongest candidate to beat Joe Biden.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;against-the-odds&quot;&gt;Against the Odds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the efforts of all the contenders, surpassing Trump’s dominance in the polls remains a considerable challenge. While the Iowa caucuses are still a few months away, giving candidates ample time to strategize and gain traction, how and when the field will narrow down in the lead-up to this crucial event is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scotts-strategy&quot;&gt;Scott’s Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Scott is gearing up to leverage this debate to showcase his viewpoints on various pressing issues like the economy and parental rights and to present his vision for the country. He aims to engage with the voters effectively and demonstrate why he is the ideal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This million-dollar boost is certainly a beacon of hope for Sen. Scott’s campaign. As the debate nears, all eyes will be on how he and his fellow candidates capitalize on this opportunity to present themselves as viable contenders and how they will strategize to gain an edge in the race against the dominant presence of Trump.

This alarming statistic has triggered severe concern over the state of education in the region, with officials and experts calling it “educational homicide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-grave-scenario&quot;&gt;A Grave Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 13 schools in question, including renowned names like Patterson High School and Frederick Douglass, are part of 33 city schools in Baltimore. This implies a whopping 40% of the city schools are entangled in this educational crisis. Jason Rodriguez, deputy director of a local non-profit People Empowered by the Struggle, called out the rampant system, emphasizing a dire need for accountability rather than funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;numbers-speak-volumes&quot;&gt;Numbers Speak Volumes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,736 students who took the test in these 13 schools, a staggering 1,295 students, making up 74.5%, scored one out of four— the lowest possible score. This situation is especially startling considering the substantial financial resources invested in the district. Last school year, Baltimore City Schools received a record $1.6 billion from taxpayers, and an additional $799 million in Covid relief funding from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-recurring-issue&quot;&gt;A Recurring Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Baltimore City Schools have been under the scanner for such dismal educational outcomes. A comparable report by Project Baltimore in 2017 also highlighted zero math proficiency in 13 schools, some of which continue to struggle with the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-response&quot;&gt;The Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Schools attribute these results to years of underfunding and the recent pandemic. They argue that recent increments in funds don’t nullify the damage caused by chronic underfunding over the years, and that improvement in such a situation would require significant time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-the-tests&quot;&gt;Beyond the Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This predicament goes beyond mere numbers and test scores, shedding light on deeper, systemic issues in education. The reality of these alarming scores opens up urgent discussions on the structure, functionality, and effectiveness of the educational systems in place and raises critical questions about the future of the students affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consistent educational crisis in Baltimore, marked by zero proficiency in math across several high schools, is a disturbing indicator of deep-rooted issues in the educational landscape. This situation demands immediate attention, thorough investigation, and robust reforms to ensure that every student has access to quality education, which is essential for shaping a prosperous and equitable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a shocking revelation, state math exams have found that not a single student from 13 high schools in Baltimore, Maryland, demonstrated proficiency in math.

Angus, also known as Conor Hickey, passed away on July 31 at the tender age of 25, leaving fans and fellow cast members grieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accidental-overdose-and-unanswered-questions&quot;&gt;Accidental Overdose and Unanswered Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has confirmed that Angus’s untimely death was the result of an accidental overdose. The Alameda County Coroner’s office revealed a mix of methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines as the cause of death, opening up discussions surrounding the pressing issue of drug use and mental health struggles among artists and young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angus’s family released a statement expressing their profound grief and shared their hope that Angus’s battle with mental health would serve as a reminder to others that they are not alone in their struggles. “Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the character’s rough exterior, Angus imbued Fezco with a sense of vulnerability and relatability, earning him adoration from fans and respect from colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud’s sudden rise to fame began when he was “plucked off the street” and cast in ‘Euphoria’. He had discussed the complexities of playing such a role and had been open about bringing a lot of his own experiences and emotions to the character of Fezco. The show’s casting director, Jennifer Venditti, remarked that Angus did not “get enough credit” for the work he put into his role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tributes-pour-in&quot;&gt;Tributes Pour In&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angus’s passing saw an outpour of grief and love from co-stars, especially Zendaya, the lead actress of ‘Euphoria’.

This alliance comes as a bold move from nations previously aligned with the G5 Sahel Alliance, a group significantly supported by France, aiming to combat terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategic-alliance-in-the-sahel&quot;&gt;A Strategic Alliance in the Sahel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries involved have witnessed military coups overturning their elected governments: Mali in 2021, Burkina Faso in 2022, and Niger in July 2023. Now, under military regimes, these nations have inked a mutual defense pact on September 16, 2023, in Bamako, known as the Liptako-Gourma Charter, which could shape regional dynamics significantly. This alliance mandates mutual defense and suppression of armed uprisings in each other’s territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sahel-states-vs-france&quot;&gt;Sahel States vs. France&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defense pact appears as a definitive step following the deteriorating relations between these nations and France. Niger, especially, has expressed substantial concern over French involvement in the region and has compelled France to withdraw all forces from its territory, impacting the counterterrorism agreements profoundly. This development has sparked protests, with the local populace demanding the exit of French forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-alliance-matters&quot;&gt;Why the Alliance Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alliance is not just a military arrangement; it intertwines the economic and political futures of the involved nations and stresses the importance of political independence, human dignity, and economic emancipation for the African people and countries. The pact appears crucial for Mali, dealing with external military intervention fears and internal insurgencies, and offers Burkina Faso an opportunity to assume a leadership role, being relatively stable compared to its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-regional-turmoil&quot;&gt;Addressing Regional Turmoil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liptako-Gourma region, where the borders of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger converge, has been a hotspot for Islamist extremist violence for over a decade. This alliance seems to be a response to ongoing regional strife and is aimed at establishing a cohesive front against terrorism, symbolizing a united effort for regional stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of the Alliance of Sahel States is a pivotal move that has the potential to reshape the geopolitical and security landscape of the Sahel region. It marks a departure from previous alignments and sets the stage for a new era of regional cooperation and conflict.
