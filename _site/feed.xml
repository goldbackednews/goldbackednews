A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Drew Barrymore’s Hosting Debacle - National Book Awards Pulls the Plug</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/16/Barrymores-Book-Awards-Controversy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drew Barrymore’s Hosting Debacle - National Book Awards Pulls the Plug" /><published>2023-09-16T14:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-16T14:05:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/16/Barrymores-Book-Awards-Controversy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/16/Barrymores-Book-Awards-Controversy/">&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Hollywood’s ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Drew Barrymore faced a significant blowback for resuming “The Drew Barrymore Show.” Consequently, the National Book Awards rescinded their invitation for the star to host their 74th ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Book Foundation, which oversees the awards, emphasized in its statement that the decision was taken to ensure that the spotlight remains firmly on celebrating writers and books. The foundation thanked Barrymore for her understanding in these pressing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Barrymore took to social media to announce the show’s return, stating, “I own this choice. We are in compliance with not discussing or promoting film and television that is struck of any kind,” the community response was swift and overwhelming. Many criticized her perceived strikebreaking stance, accusing the actress of attempting to manipulate the narrative and questioning her commitment to the industry’s workers.&lt;/p&gt;

A beloved teacher, Mariame Sylla, met with a grim end after she went out for a seemingly routine walk. Harold Landon III, a man previously embroiled in violent acts against women, has emerged as the prime suspect behind this heinous act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-chilling-sequence-of-events&quot;&gt;A Chilling Sequence of Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harrowing tale began on July 29, when Sylla, a cherished figure in the Greenbelt community, went out for her regular walk. What transpired next remains shrouded in mystery and horror. Days after her disappearance, parts of her dismembered body surfaced in a pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Harold Landon III had a past tainted with episodes of violence, the connection between him and Sylla appears non-existent. Authorities are scratching their heads, trying to decipher a motive or any semblance of a relationship between the two. The baffling nature of the crime has amplified its ghastliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prior-charges-and-controversial-defense&quot;&gt;Prior Charges and Controversial Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landon, currently 33, had already been incarcerated, accused of infringing an order of protection against his former girlfriend. The police in Prince George’s County, after connecting the dots, identified him as the potential assailant behind Sylla’s tragic demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent court session, the presiding judge labeled the case as having “horrific facts.” Yet, Landon’s defense team has taken a stance that challenges the evidence stacked against their client. They’ve contended that the foundational proofs, including DNA evidence and photographs, are merely circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Counsel Jonathon Church remains unperturbed. He expressed his firm belief in the strength of the case, pointing out the clarity with which Landon was identified in the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-victims-legacy-and-communitys-grief&quot;&gt;The Victim’s Legacy and Community’s Grief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mariame Sylla, a beacon of hope and inspiration for many, has left behind a community in mourning. The 59-year-old teacher was a figure of admiration and respect, with Prince George’s County Police Chief Malik Aziz lauding her contributions. Sylla’s funeral saw an outpouring of grief, attended by a diverse crowd, including her past students, colleagues, and diplomats from her homeland, Ivory Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her tragic and unforeseen death reignites pressing concerns over the safety of women. Aisha Braveboy, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney, emphasized Landon’s track record of female abuse, alluding to his prior conviction in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigations remain in full swing, with the authorities committed to bringing justice to Sylla and her grieving family. Landon, as of now, is held without bail and is slated to appear before the court on Oct. 11 for preliminary hearings on the charges of first-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the legal proceedings evolve, one thing remains clear: Mariame Sylla’s untimely demise has created a void that may never be filled, and her legacy as a beloved teacher and community member will be etched in memories forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A gruesome discovery has shaken the Maryland community to its core.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a contingent of Democrats faced a barrage of furious protesters during a press conference focused on the escalating migrant crisis in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, strategically positioned outside the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan - a now-established relief center for asylum seekers - was overshadowed by a vocal crowd chanting, “Send them back!” and “Close the border!” The cacophony became so pronounced that the messages of the Democratic leaders were often lost amidst the fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ocasio-Cortez tried to bring attention to the resources and support being pooled for the migrants, a megaphone-wielding protester shouted her down, emphasizing the legality of immigration. His words, “Illegal immigration is not right! Respect the constitution, close the border!” rang out loud, echoing a sentiment shared by a significant portion of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delegation present, besides Ocasio-Cortez and Espaillat, included several high-profile Democratic representatives from various states, indicating the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the clamor, Ocasio-Cortez outlined three significant consensus points: a call for increased federal resources, the urgency for work authorizations to expedite migrants’ employment, and the extension of Temporary Protected Status, especially for the Venezuelan populace who make up a considerable portion of the current migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a shadow looms large.

This was highlighted in the recent “Inside Jeopardy!” podcast episode where producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss discussed Mayim’s reactions to contestants’ answers. Bialik had openly shared her amazement at contestants’ swift recall abilities, often expressing her astonishment when they got things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her genuine surprise was endearing to some, it became a point of contention for others, including the show’s producer. As Whitcomb Foss suggested, maintaining the pace and flow of the show was paramount, stating, “Yes, correct, you got it” should suffice as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

As the curtains rise and fall on each episode, Bialik continues her endeavor, balancing critique with self-improvement, and forging her own unique path on the “Jeopardy!” stage.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden Aides on Edge - Looming Trump Threat in 2024?</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/16/Biden-Aides-Fears/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden Aides on Edge - Looming Trump Threat in 2024?" /><published>2023-09-16T09:16:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-16T09:16:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/16/Biden-Aides-Fears</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/16/Biden-Aides-Fears/">&lt;p&gt;The political landscape is buzzing with whispers of a potential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2024. Amongst the most anxious are Biden’s aides, who are reportedly feeling the heat from recent polls suggesting a neck-to-neck race between the two former contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gravity of Trump’s Threat&lt;/strong&gt;
CNN recently reported that the prospect of Trump returning as the Republican candidate is causing “existential stress” within the Biden camp. While Trump’s known controversial nature might make him seem like an easier opponent to some, Biden’s aides are gravely concerned. They fear that any slip-ups by the Biden campaign, or unanticipated missteps by Biden himself, could potentially see Trump return to the White House, a scenario they view as detrimental to American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Media’s Pressure on Biden&lt;/strong&gt;
The pressure isn’t solely stemming from the possibility of a Trump comeback. Liberal media outlets and respected columnists have lately turned their scrutiny onto the Biden administration. A recent piece by David Ignatius from The Washington Post called on Biden and Vice President Harris to reconsider their 2024 run, expressing concerns that their campaign could jeopardize the progress made since Trump’s defeat in the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaign Woes and Media Scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;
To add to the worries, Biden’s campaign is experiencing a noticeable absence of notable names and big checkbooks from the Democratic donor community. Aides are pointing fingers at the media, accusing them of amplifying concerns about Biden’s age and the controversies surrounding his son, Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent polls don’t help alleviate these anxieties. A significant portion of the American populace, including many from the Democratic base, have voiced concerns about Biden’s age, given he would be 86 at the end of a second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing the Future&lt;/strong&gt;
As the potential for a historic rematch between Biden and Trump becomes increasingly plausible, the Biden camp must navigate their internal apprehensions and the external pressures of the media, polls, and public opinion. The stage is set for a tumultuous run-up to 2024, with the shadows of the past election looming large.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The political landscape is buzzing with whispers of a potential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2024.

This penalty marks the maiden time TikTok has faced repercussions under Europe’s stringent data privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of Big Tech companies have their European headquarters situated in Dublin. It is here that Ireland’s Data Protection Commission decreed the fine of 345 million euros. TikTok is under fire for transgressions stemming from the latter half of 2020, primarily concerning the default settings of the accounts for teenagers. These default configurations left the accounts public, enabling unrestricted access to and commentary on their videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the “family pairing” feature, intended to allow parental oversight, had a loophole. This laxity permitted adults to activate direct messaging for users within the age bracket of 16 and 17, bypassing their consent. Moreover, TikTok reportedly nudged its younger demographic towards selecting more “privacy intrusive” alternatives during their sign-up and content upload procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TikTok has rebuffed the ruling, particularly balking at the quantum of the fine, they have indicated that most of the grievances addressed by the regulatory body were outdated. The platform underscored its proactive measures, such as making accounts of those under 16 private by default and deactivating direct messaging capabilities for the 13 to 15 age group, initiated well before the inquiry’s commencement in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these arguments, it’s evident that the European Union is taking a stand, with Brussels now stepping up to the plate to ensure stricter regulations and curb missteps in the digital realm. The essence is to retain its vanguard position in the sphere of tech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the onus of social media firms is crystal clear. They need to present options without bias, especially to the younger generation, to ensure the preservation of their privacy rights. Data privacy is an ongoing global concern, with TikTok’s data sharing with China adding another layer of complexity. The European community’s reservations regarding the potential for sensitive user information making its way to China have led TikTok to establish a data center in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broader panorama, other tech behemoths like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta have faced the music in Europe, indicating the continent’s no-nonsense approach to data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

During a recent speech, Biden seemed to link “African Americans and Hispanic workers” with individuals “without high school diplomas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Discrepancy in Words&lt;/strong&gt;
During his speech at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Md., President Biden remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, the workers without high school diplomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the White House’s transcript tells a slightly different story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment, particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, and the workers without high-school diplomas. The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for women now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that there’s a discrepancy between what Biden said and how the White House chose to transcribe it. The altered version seems to create more distance between minority communities and those without high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s important to put Biden’s comments into context. Over the years, he’s made several controversial remarks, leading some to label them as instances of ‘ignorant racism’. Among these, he referred to “poor kids” being “just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” and also described former President Barack Obama as “bright and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a history of questionable statements, this latest incident has further ignited debates about the President’s perspectives on race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussions around systemic racism and inequality continue to dominate the global narrative, leaders are expected to choose their words wisely, setting a tone of inclusivity and understanding. It remains to be seen whether this latest incident will be brushed under the rug or lead to broader conversations about the inherent biases that might still exist at the highest levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a week already rife with political tension, President Joe Biden added fuel to the fire with a statement that has left many outraged.

In a twist of reality mirroring fiction, the late Stan Lee, the genius behind many of Marvel’s iconic characters, found himself ensnared in a contentious elder abuse case that spanned five years. This week, the legal skirmish reached its conclusion, but not without a few cliffhangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;superheros-tumultuous-last-days&quot;&gt;Superhero’s Tumultuous Last Days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before his death on November 12, 2018, Stan Lee had been the central figure in an elder abuse lawsuit. The suit accused his ex-business manager, Jerardo Olivarez, of siphoning a whopping $1.4 million from Lee’s accounts. Later, Uri Litvak, an attorney associated with Olivarez, found himself added to the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations trace back to the dynamic between the two defendants. Olivarez introduced Litvak to Lee, pressuring the comic legend to retain the latter’s legal services for his business endeavors. The resulting relationship, according to the complaint filed in 2018, led to significant financial losses for Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continuing-the-fight&quot;&gt;Continuing The Fight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Stan Lee’s passing, his daughter, Joan Lee, took on the mantle of the case as a trustee of his estate. The recent judgment brought a twist when the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled in favor of Litvak. The crux of the decision rested on the fact that the statute of limitations had expired by a mere five days when the case against Litvak was initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lee estate fervently argued that Litvak’s professional interactions with the Marvel creator had extended beyond the lawsuit’s initial filing date, potentially halting the statute of limitations. However, arbitrator David Brickner cited evidence in the form of a letter from Lee in 2017, clarifying that Litvak’s services had been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-of-an-era&quot;&gt;End Of An Era&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conclusion draws the curtain on the legal battles that clouded Stan Lee’s final years. The legendary creator of superheroes such as Iron Man, Hulk, Spider-Man, and Thor faced personal battles that drew as much attention as his comic world exploits. These included conflicts with his daughter Joan, allegations against her for elder abuse, and accusations against former associates out for his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as with most superhero tales, the story eventually found its resolution. The Marvel maestro, despite the shadows cast by these controversies, ultimately sided with his daughter. Their bond, it seems, was stronger than any adversarial plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stan Lee’s legacy in the comic book realm is unmatched, having shaped the industry since 1939. And though the recent years saw him grappling with personal challenges, from health issues to the loss of his wife of nearly 70 years in 2017, his contribution to the world of comics and entertainment remains unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of this lawsuit may be seen by many as the final chapter in the storied life of a man who taught generations to dream, hope, and always fight for justice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The enthralling world of superheroes often pits the forces of good against the sinister plots of villains.
