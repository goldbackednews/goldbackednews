A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/12/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-12T16:15:06-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-12T16:15:06-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/12/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/12/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden’s Controversial Palestine Funding: Flirting with Anti-Terrorism Laws?</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/12/Biden-Palestine-Funding-Critique/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden’s Controversial Palestine Funding: Flirting with Anti-Terrorism Laws?" /><published>2023-10-12T15:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-12T15:08:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/12/Biden-Palestine-Funding-Critique</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/12/Biden-Palestine-Funding-Critique/">&lt;p&gt;In what many critics describe as a questionable move, President Joe Biden’s decision to resume hefty financial support to Palestinian entities is now under judicial scrutiny. U.S. District Court Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk has stepped in to grant a much-needed review, prompted by concerns that Biden’s generosity may be in stark violation of established anti-terrorism laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal review comes on the heels of a lawsuit initiated by Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, and the America First Legal Foundation (AFL). Their shared contention is that the Biden administration may be carelessly allowing Economic Support Funds, meant for humanitarian purposes, to be misused. Such funds, instead of uplifting the Palestinian people, could be financing terrorist activities in the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s decision to rekindle financial relations with the Palestinian National Authority stands in sharp contrast to the more cautious approach of his predecessor. Former President Donald Trump had prudently halted any payments, heeding the Taylor Force Act of 2018, which clearly restricts U.S. financial assistance to Palestine while it continues supporting imprisoned terrorists and their dependents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the issue is a staggering sum of approximately $500 million greenlit by Biden, representing a lion’s share of the total U.S. aid to Palestine. And as if to add fuel to the fire, an additional $700 million was routed to a UN agency in the region — an agency Trump had wisely exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gravity of this decision becomes even more palpable against the backdrop of the recent devastating terrorist attacks on Israel, attributed to Hamas and Hezbollah. Both groups, as The Wall Street Journal points out, are under the financial and operational umbrella of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human toll of these conflicts is alarming: Israel mourns the loss of over 1,200 souls, with another 3,400 nursing injuries and more than 200 held hostage. Palestinian sources too paint a grim picture with over 1,100 dead, 5,400 wounded, and a startling 263,000 individuals displaced, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Free Beacon has also unearthed unsettling findings. Despite being armed with internal reports suggesting that such funding might embolden Hamas, the Biden administration moved forward, seemingly undeterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the judicial review progresses, many hope it brings clarity to the situation. However, Biden’s decision to potentially put U.S. funds in the hands of extremist groups, directly or indirectly, is a matter that will undoubtedly cast a long shadow over his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In what many critics describe as a questionable move, President Joe Biden’s decision to resume hefty financial support to Palestinian entities is now under judicial scrutiny.

Known for his no-holds-barred commentary, the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; star stated that Democrats aim to “&lt;em&gt;ruin every city in America&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview, when Lowe recounted Republican principles as explained by former California Republican Congressman David Dreier, Schwarzenegger pointed out that a key principle missing from the list was “Strong law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lowe queried the &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; star about his thoughts on what Democrats stand for, Schwarzenegger responded emphatically, saying, “&lt;em&gt;We want to f&lt;/em&gt;ck up every city in America. That seems to be the theme right now*.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement was a reflection of the actor’s view of Democrat-led regimes in major American cities, which are currently grappling with debt, crime, and a decline in citizens and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Schwarzenegger’s controversial statements and political stance have been a matter of debate even among Republicans. Despite being a self-proclaimed Republican, Schwarzenegger’s views often tilt towards the left. His support for issues such as pro-choice and climate change, and his strong stance on COVID-19 safety measures, have sometimes clashed with conservative ideals. In fact, in 2021, he famously told conservatives “&lt;em&gt;screw your freedom&lt;/em&gt;” when many opposed the government’s measures to combat the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Schwarzenegger’s 2021 comparison of Trump’s administration to Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Party further drew ire from many conservatives. Yet, in a recent interview with the New York Times, the &lt;em&gt;Commando&lt;/em&gt; actor reaffirmed his allegiance to the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you agree with Schwarzenegger’s opinions, his outspoken nature ensures that he continues to remain a significant and polarizing figure in both the entertainment and political arenas.

&lt;p&gt;During an interview on the “Today” show with Hoda Kotb, Pinkett Smith made the disclosure while discussing her new book titled “Worthy.” She stated, “&lt;em&gt;We live separately&lt;/em&gt;,” emphasizing that despite the separation, the idea of divorce is off the table. “&lt;em&gt;I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through whatever. And I just haven’t been able to break that promise,&lt;/em&gt;” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The separation came about in 2016 after the couple “were just exhausted with trying” to maintain their union. Both had varying expectations of each other, leading them to drift apart. Yet, despite the challenges, they chose not to publicize their separation, even amidst intense media scrutiny. This scrutiny peaked when rumors circulated about Jada’s relationship with family friend, August Alsina. The actress confirmed this relationship in 2021 on her show, “Red Table Talk,” referring to her involvement with Alsina as an “entanglement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the revelation also indicates that the couple was separated during Will Smith’s notorious 2022 Oscar incident, wherein he slapped comedian Chris Rock. The incident occurred after Rock made a joke referencing Jada’s alopecia condition. Recalling the event, Jada expressed her disbelief, “&lt;em&gt;I thought, ‘This is a skit. I was like, ‘There’s no way that Will hit him.’ It wasn’t until Will started to walk back to his chair that I even realized it wasn’t a skit.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the complexities in their relationship, the bond between the two remains strong. “&lt;em&gt;We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together. We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us,&lt;/em&gt;” Pinkett Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple, who tied the knot in 1997, share two children: Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will Smith also has a son, Trey, 30, from a previous marriage to Sheree Zampino, whom Jada lovingly refers to as her “bonus son.”&lt;/p&gt;

According to a recent Emerson College poll, Trump leads by a significant 9-point margin in a potential face-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways from the Poll:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Lead:&lt;/strong&gt; 45% of the registered voters in Pennsylvania expressed support for Trump, compared to Biden’s 36%. Interestingly, this shows a shift in voter sentiment, as 43% voted for Biden and 42% for Trump in the 2020 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Voters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump appears to resonate with independent voters, securing a remarkable 44% of their support, while Biden trails at 14%. The remaining voters are split between other candidates or are still making up their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden’s Approval Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Notably, Biden’s approval rating in the state is at a concerning low. Only 31% of Pennsylvanians have a positive view of his presidency, while a significant 51% disapprove, rendering his net approval rating at -20.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty among Supporters:&lt;/strong&gt; Half of Trump’s supporters firmly assert that nothing could deter their support for him in the 2024 presidential race. On the flip side, 53% of Biden’s supporters echo the same unwavering loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senate Race Insights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Trump is soaring in popularity, it’s interesting to note that this surge isn’t necessarily translating to other Republicans. In a potential U.S. Senate race, the Democratic Senator Bob Casey leads over Republican Dave McCormick by eight points, standing at 41% to McCormick’s 33%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerson College Polling’s Executive Director, Spencer Kimball, shed light on these variances, especially concerning age demographics. Biden holds an edge over Trump among voters under 40 (44% to 39%). Yet, among those below 30, Trump gains traction, leading 45% to 39%. Senator Casey, however, retains dominance across both age brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education also plays a significant role. Voters with a high school degree or less significantly favor Trump (53% to 27%). Yet, when it comes to the Senate race, Casey just slightly outpaces McCormick among the same group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2024 elections approaching, these poll results, derived from 430 registered Pennsylvanian voters, will be pivotal for campaign strategies. The poll’s credibility interval is ±4.7%, and it follows another by the Marketing Resource Group, where Trump had a seven-point lead over Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOP’s decision-making process took the form of a secret ballot, wherein Scalise secured a notable 113 votes, outpacing Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, who managed to garner 99 votes. Prior to this vote, House Republicans had deliberated and eventually voted against a motion that proposed elevating the threshold for electing the House speaker to 217 votes, amounting to a majority of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unfolding of events comes in the wake of the unanticipated ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. McCarthy’s removal marked an unparalleled moment in American political history, as it was the first occasion the U.S. House of Representatives made the collective decision to unseat its leader. Eight members of McCarthy’s party, in tandem with all House Democrats, catalyzed his fall from grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the scramble to fill the speaker vacancy intensified, the spotlight inevitably narrowed down to two frontrunners: Scalise and Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio. Scalise, a seasoned political figure, has been recognized as McCarthy’s right-hand man for a significant duration, notwithstanding the simmering rivalry that exists between the pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Jordan, known for his closer ties to McCarthy, initially received an outpouring of support from influential conservatives within the GOP. Key figures like House Freedom Caucus Policy Chair Chip Roy, a Republican representative from Texas, openly endorsed Jordan. It’s worth noting that Jordan’s political career boasts of being a co-founder of the influential House Freedom Caucus group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political realm, as it stands, is rife with conjecture and anticipation regarding the future of the House’s leadership. As tensions simmer and factions within the GOP rally behind their preferred candidates, the stage is set for a monumental showdown in the race for the House Speaker position.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a significant political move, House Republicans have elected Majority Leader Steve Scalise, representing Louisiana, as their leading candidate for the esteemed role of House Speaker.

Strikingly, this date is commonly associated with horror movies and the popular Halloween holiday, further deepening concerns about the group’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dubbing the day as “Al-Aqsa Flood” Friday, Hamas recalls their past operation, which resulted in the death of over 1,200 Israelis, leaving approximately 3,000 injured and more than 100 kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), in its report, cites Hamas stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We declare next Friday, ‘The Friday of the Al-Aqsa Flood,’ as a day of general mobilization in our Arab and Islamic world and among the free people of the world. It is a day to rally support, offer aid, and participate actively. It is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation, isolate it, and foil all its aggressive schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas continues to stress the importance of the day as an opportunity to express profound love for Palestine, Jerusalem, and Al-Aqsa, urging it to be a day of sacrifice, heroism, and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas has further beckoned Palestinians in the West Bank (which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria) to rise against Israeli forces. Moreover, they appeal to Arab citizens residing in Israel, referring to them as “our people within the occupied territories of 1948”, to rebel against the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In popular culture, particularly in the entertainment sector, Friday the 13th has long been a day linked with horror, often chosen for the launch of horror film releases, captivating audiences with fictional tales of terror. However, the atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel paint a stark and grim reality, far from fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the world will react to this ominous call to arms on a day already shrouded in superstition and horror. The global community must remain vigilant and united in the face of such threats, ensuring peace and security for all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a chilling announcement, the Palestinian Hamas terror group, simply known as Hamas, has urged Muslims globally to mark a “Day of Jihad” on Friday, October 13th.

The U.S. military, deeply concerned about Iranian proxy groups operating in Iraq, Syria, and the Persian Gulf, is taking steps to shield American and allied forces from harm in the region’s increasingly volatile climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unnamed U.S. official commented on the unfolding scenario as presenting “an opportunity,” as Politico reported. Army Maj. Geoffrey Carmichael, who serves as a spokesperson for the U.S. military campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, underscored the military’s commitment to remaining alert. He warned against “malign actors” eager to exploit the current unrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Carmichael didn’t explicitly name Iran in his remarks, he firmly stated the U.S. position. “Make no mistake, we reserve our inherent right to self-defense whenever faced with threats that place our forces in harm’s way,” he told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, further cautioned external entities trying to fuel the fire. Without directly naming Iran, he stressed the international community’s stand against attempts to widen the conflict in Israel. Echoing this sentiment, President Joe Biden made a resounding condemnation of Hamas, equating its violent actions with ISIS’s atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to strengthen the U.S. military’s presence and deter any potential Iranian or proxy offensives, the Pentagon has made strategic moves. These include dispatching an aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean and considering the deployment of a second carrier. Additional fighter aircraft have also been mobilized to the Middle East, ready to act swiftly against any Iranian-sponsored aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that while Iranian-backed groups have currently halted their attacks on U.S. troops, they remain a significant concern. This apprehension has been exacerbated by Turkish airstrikes targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), whom Turkey views as terrorists. These airstrikes followed a terrorist incident in Ankara, believed to be the work of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these complications, U.S. forces recently intercepted a threatening Turkish drone in northeast Syria. Nevertheless, according to another Pentagon official, there’s been a concerted effort from senior levels to avoid direct confrontations, especially after this incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF commander, highlighted the resulting instability from the Turkish airstrikes. He noted that this disruption has provided an opening for ISIS to launch new terrorist attacks in the region, directly jeopardizing the joint operations between U.S. forces and the SDF. Abdi called for global condemnation and swift action to counter these security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

But her story took yet another twist as she allegedly tried to escape custody during a medical appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armstrong had previously captivated the media when she fled the U.S. during the early stages of the investigation into Wilson’s death, only to be apprehended after a 43-day manhunt on a Costa Rican beach. Despite the dramatic circumstances surrounding her capture, authorities did not anticipate what was to come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Travis County Sheriff’s Office (TCSO) spokesperson, Drew Knight, Armstrong tried to seize an opportunity to escape as she and two correction officers were leaving a medical facility. Thanks to her high school track and field background, Armstrong led officers on a 10-minute foot chase. However, her efforts were in vain, and she was quickly recaptured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to delve into the backstory to grasp the significance of this latest escape attempt. Armstrong stands accused of the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Mo Wilson. Wilson, after a night out with Armstrong’s live-in boyfriend, professional cyclist Colin Strickland, returned to a friend’s apartment. She was found hours later in a bathroom, lifeless, in a pool of her blood. This tragic event unraveled the tangled love-triangle narrative, with Armstrong allegedly seeing Wilson as a romantic rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armstrong’s boyfriend, Strickland, however, defended her in interviews with detectives. He repeatedly vouched for her character, stating he could not believe she would be capable of such violence. Despite these assertions, surveillance footage and evidence, including a handgun from Armstrong’s residence that matched shell casings from the crime scene, pointed toward her involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, Armstrong was questioned by the Austin Police on May 12, a day after the tragic event. But she was told she wasn’t under arrest and was released. Taking advantage of this freedom, Armstrong fled to New York and then jetted internationally from New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Costa Rican authorities, after her capture, extradited her back to the U.S. due to an immigration violation. She has since been held at the Travis County Jail in Austin on a hefty $3.5 million bail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this ongoing saga, Armstrong’s defense has actively disputed the prosecution’s depiction of her seeing Wilson as a “romantic rival,” dismissing the notion as “misogynistic and fictitious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this case unfolds, it’s evident that the story of Kaitlin Armstrong and Mo Wilson is not just another crime narrative but a saga filled with intrigue, emotion, and unexpected turns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Kaitlin Armstrong, an Austin, Texas yoga instructor, made headlines after being accused of the dramatic love-triangle murder of professional cyclist Anna Moriah “Mo” Wilson.
