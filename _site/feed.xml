A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/11/03/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-11-03T00:18:44-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-03T00:18:44-04:00</updated><id>/2023/11/03/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/11/03/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Over 500 Americans Trapped: A Crisis Unfolding in Gaza</title><link href="/news/2023/11/02/Held-Hostage-Gaza/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Over 500 Americans Trapped: A Crisis Unfolding in Gaza" /><published>2023-11-02T15:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-02T15:07:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/11/02/Held-Hostage-Gaza</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/11/02/Held-Hostage-Gaza/">&lt;p&gt;The crisis in Gaza escalates as over 500 Americans and their family members find themselves trapped, their exit denied by Hamas authorities. Reports vary, with Israel Defense Forces claiming 230 Americans are being held, while other sources report numbers as high as 500. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the gravity of the situation in a recent Senate Committee on Appropriations, stating that around 1,000 individuals, comprising 400 American citizens and their family members, are stuck in Gaza, desperately wanting to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation has garnered international attention, with major news outlets reporting on the unfolding crisis. The Washington Post highlighted the plight of at least 400 American hostages unable to leave due to the ongoing tensions and restrictions in the area. CBS News further reported that between 500 and 600 Americans are among the 2.3 million people trapped in the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian territory’s Hamas rulers initiated their terror attack on October 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Americans in Gaza find themselves in a precarious situation. While not directly held by armed Hamas terrorists, they are nonetheless trapped against their will, their freedom of movement severely restricted. Senator Marsha Blackburn brought attention to this issue, questioning whether dual passport holders and Palestinians are also being counted among the hostages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House has pointed out that Hamas is actively preventing people from leaving Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt, adding another layer of complexity to the crisis. However, there seems to be a glimmer of hope as reports emerged of dozens of people being allowed to enter the Rafah crossing — marking the first time foreign passport holders have been permitted to leave since the Israel-Hamas war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high, and the world watches as the crisis in Gaza unfolds. The safety and well-being of over 500 Americans are on the line, and the urgency for a resolution has never been greater. The American government, international bodies, and concerned citizens alike are calling for immediate action, hoping to bring an end to this crisis and safely bring home those trapped in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The crisis in Gaza escalates as over 500 Americans and their family members find themselves trapped, their exit denied by Hamas authorities.

Jesse Watters, known for his sharp analysis and no-holds-barred commentary, left no stone unturned as he dissected the money trail, bringing to light the unsettling connections that many have long suspected but were never able to conclusively prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, whispers and speculations have circulated around President Biden’s financial dealings, particularly regarding his ties to China. However, it seemed as if Biden believed he could simply run out the clock, evading the need to disclose his bank records, and with them, the truth. But as Watters pointed out, in today’s digital age, accessing bank records is a far cry from the tedious process of rummaging through physical files. With a simple account number, the truth can be printed out in black and white, laid bare for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative James Comer has been at the forefront of this investigation, diligently working to uncover the facts and follow the money straight to the source. And it seems his efforts are finally bearing fruit. Despite the left’s persistent claims of innocence and lack of evidence, the Biden family bank records are beginning to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this controversy is a $40,000 check made out directly to Joe Biden. While the left continues to insist that there is no incriminating evidence against the President, this check raises a multitude of questions. The funds can be traced back to China, as uncovered by Rep. Comer. The money trail is convoluted, yet undeniable: China wired $5 million to Hunter Biden’s company, which then sent $400,000 to Hunter, and subsequently, money was sent to Biden’s brother, finally culminating in a $40,000 check to Biden himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the numbers, a startling realization comes to light: $40,000 is precisely 10% of $400,000. Watters aptly coined this the ‘10% for “The Big Guy”’ scenario, drawing a direct line between the money from China and Biden’s bank account. This revelation raises the stakes significantly, challenging the Democrats’ narrative and forcing the question: What does a smoking gun look like in the face of such compelling evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the country watches closely, the Biden money saga continues to unfold. Watters’ exposé has brought to light the uncomfortable truths and unanswered questions that linger around President Biden’s financial dealings, making it clear that this story is far from over. The call for transparency and accountability has never been louder, as Americans from coast to coast demand answers.

George Santos (R-N.Y.) managed to stave off expulsion from the House of Representatives. The scene turned chaotic as Santos engaged in a heated exchange with an anti-Israel protester, showcasing the high tensions surrounding the Congressman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos found himself in the eye of the storm, with a faction of his fellow New York Republicans leading the charge to expel him from the House. Despite the pressure, the final vote tallied at 213-179 against expulsion, with 19 lawmakers choosing to vote “present.” It is crucial to note that expelling a member from the House is an exceptional action, requiring a two-thirds majority of all members present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the vote saw 24 Republicans favoring expulsion, while 31 Democrats opted to keep Santos in the House. This vote distribution led Santos to comment on the perceived political landscape, stating, “There’s more Democrats in this body that believe in the rule of law than there are Republicans. That’s what you should know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos, under a cloud of legal troubles, stood his ground, asserting his right to due process. “I am fighting to clear my name. I am fighting for due process,” he emphasized, highlighting the significance of these legal principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Republicans spearheading the expulsion effort included Anthony D’Esposito, Nick LaLota, and Mike Lawler. Santos, defending himself on the House floor, accused them of overstepping their roles, acting as “judge, jury, and executioner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos’s speech underscored his commitment to proving his innocence against the myriad of charges leveled against him. “Efforts taken by other members in this body to act as jury and executioner are unconscionable and reckless to our Republican system of government and to the integrity of this body,” he proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the sole member of Congress to speak in his defense during the debate, Santos’s words resonated with the need for consistency in upholding constitutional values. He questioned the actions of his peers, urging them to reflect on their commitment to the Constitution while challenging their role in this legal process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos’s escape from expulsion does not mark the end of his legal battles, as he faces 23 charges, including conspiracy, wire fraud, making false statements, falsification of records, aggravated identity theft, and credit card fraud. The resolution of these charges will be crucial in determining his political future, but for now, Santos remains a member of the House of Representatives, emphasizing the paramount importance of due process in the American legal system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Rep.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) did not mince words as she declared that there is absolutely no room in Congress for individuals who share the same anti-Israel views as Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Boebert’s statement comes in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7th, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives, caught in the midst of political tumult, witnessed a motion last week by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) seeking to censure Tlaib for her vehement criticism of Israel following the attack. However, this motion was tabled with a vote of 222-186, as 23 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. Boebert, unwavering in her stance, was not among the dissenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her appearance on “Eric Bolling The Balance,” Boebert clearly articulated her viewpoint, stating, “There are lines that members of Congress should not cross, and supporting terrorist groups like Hamas is definitely one of those lines.” She continued by expressing that there is simply no place in Congress for individuals who embody ignorance and hatred to the extent that Tlaib does, voicing her support for the censure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since becoming the first Congress member of Palestinian descent in 2018, Tlaib has been vocal in her critique of Israeli policies, calling for sanctions and accusing Israel of perpetuating apartheid in the Gaza Strip. She maintains this stance despite the Palestinians’ self-governing status in Gaza, a result of electing Hamas to power in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boebert did not hold back as she addressed this issue, stating, “There are some [in Congress] who are siding with Hamas during this horrible and brutal attack on Israel, this war that is taking place.” She highlighted that while there are members on the opposite side of the aisle expressing support for Israel, it remains uncertain whether it will translate into concrete action against one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance, Boebert affirmed, “Israel, our nation’s most trusted ally, has every right to defend itself. And we are here standing in solidarity as Republicans with Israel every step of the way.” She condemned Hamas’ actions as utterly repulsive and expressed her heartfelt prayers for the Israelis and all innocent victims caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boebert’s strong, unwavering support for Israel and her call for accountability within Congress reflect the conservative values of standing with allies and ensuring that anti-Israel sentiments do not find a foothold in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) did not mince words as she declared that there is absolutely no room in Congress for individuals who share the same anti-Israel views as Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Boebert’s statement comes in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7th, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead. The House of Representatives, caught in the midst of political tumult, witnessed a motion last week by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) seeking to censure Tlaib for her vehement criticism of Israel following the attack. However, this motion was tabled with a vote of 222-186, as 23 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. Boebert, unwavering in her stance, was not among the dissenters. During her appearance on “Eric Bolling The Balance,” Boebert clearly articulated her viewpoint, stating, “There are lines that members of Congress should not cross, and supporting terrorist groups like Hamas is definitely one of those lines.” She continued by expressing that there is simply no place in Congress for individuals who embody ignorance and hatred to the extent that Tlaib does, voicing her support for the censure. Since becoming the first Congress member of Palestinian descent in 2018, Tlaib has been vocal in her critique of Israeli policies, calling for sanctions and accusing Israel of perpetuating apartheid in the Gaza Strip.

The incident occurred during the much-anticipated trick-or-treat festivities in Cumberland County, and has since spurred a full-blown police investigation, as well as a community-wide call to action for increased vigilance and caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silver Spring Township Police Department reported that officers were dispatched to Pine Hill Avenue at 7:03 p.m. on Halloween night, following the parent’s alarming discovery. Authorities confirmed that needles were found in three separate pieces of candy, with one being discovered by a parent who had taken a bite of a piece they picked up off the ground. Thankfully, the quick reflexes of the parent prevented any injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local police chief, Chris Raubenstine, expressed his concern and disbelief at the situation, stating that this was the first time in his 30-year career that he had encountered such a malicious act. The police are currently investigating whether the needle-laden candy was dropped accidentally or was placed intentionally, with malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such incidents, while rare, cast a shadow on what should be a fun and festive time for children and families. Halloween is a beloved tradition, filled with costumes, laughter, and of course, plenty of sweet treats. However, the discovery of sewing needles in candy serves as a stark reminder that there are individuals who seek to harm and create chaos, even during times of celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police have since issued an urgent warning to parents and guardians, urging them to meticulously inspect all candy before allowing their children to consume it. They have also requested the public’s assistance in identifying the individual or individuals responsible for this heinous act, providing a hotline for anyone with information to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conservative community, known for its values of family, safety, and community, has rallied together in the face of this threat. Parents are sharing warnings and safety tips on social media, ensuring that their neighbors are aware of the potential danger and know how to protect their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the investigation is ongoing, the community’s swift response and unwavering commitment to safety highlight the strength and resilience that define conservative values. In times of crisis, the community comes together, united in their dedication to protecting the innocent and bringing those responsible to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Halloween comes to a close, and the candy wrappers are discarded, the lessons learned from this unnerving incident will remain. The community, empowered by knowledge and strengthened by unity, stands ready to face any threat, ensuring a safe and joyful Halloween for all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A discerning parent discovered sewing needles hidden inside their child’s Halloween candy.

A local state judge, Sarah B. Wallace, has denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, but the fight is far from over. The Trump legal team remains unshaken, ready to present a robust defense of the 45th President’s right to run for office again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six Colorado voters, four of whom identify as Republicans, have brought this case forward, attempting to disqualify Trump based on his alleged involvement in the January 6th events at the U.S. Capitol. They accuse the former president of inciting an insurrection, referencing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in their argument. However, the facts tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s attorneys have ardently argued that his speech on that fateful day was fully protected under the First Amendment, emphasizing his call for peaceful protest. Former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler, representing Trump, stated, “The failure to do something is the opposite of the word ‘engaged.’ President Trump didn’t engage…He gave a speech in which he asked people to peacefully and patriotically go to the Capitol and protest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal battle in Colorado is not an isolated incident. Similar cases are emerging in Minnesota and Michigan, as the left continues its relentless pursuit to silence Trump and his millions of supporters. But the Trump camp remains resilient, standing strong against these unfounded attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Trump supporters and conservative Republicans, this case represents yet another attempt by the left to undermine the democratic process and stifle the voice of the American people. Trump’s commitment to fighting this legal battle demonstrates his unwavering dedication to preserving the values that make America great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the hearings continue, all eyes are on Colorado, where the outcome of this case will set a precedent for future battles. The conservative community stands united, confident in Trump’s ability to overcome this challenge and continue his fight for a better, stronger America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a legacy of economic prosperity, national security, and unwavering patriotism, Trump’s place on the 2024 ballot is not just a legal matter—it’s a question of upholding the principles that define our nation. The people have spoken before, and they are ready to do so again, standing by a leader who has proven time and again that he puts America first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of adversity, Trump and his supporters remain optimistic, fueled by a deep love for their country and a steadfast belief in the power of the people.

Prosecutors had initially sought a staggering 100-year sentence, highlighting the gravity of the allegations against Nelson-Koch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson-Koch, who was 67 at the time of the crimes, engaged in illicit sexual activities with a 14-year-old boy in the school’s basement, subjecting him to repeated acts of sexual assault. The former teacher faced a plethora of charges, including sexual assault of a child, child enticement with sexual contact, and exposing intimate parts to a minor, resulting in her being found guilty on over a dozen counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prosecution presented a compelling case, detailing the severe trauma inflicted upon the young victim, the defense managed to shed light on Nelson-Koch’s character through testimonies from her friends. These character references played a pivotal role in the court’s decision, ultimately leading to a reduced sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this case extend far beyond the courtroom, as it has ignited a broader conversation about the safety of children in educational institutions and the need for stringent measures to prevent such horrific incidents. The Monroe County community has been left reeling, as parents grapple with the reality of sexual predators lurking within trusted institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the victim’s father delivered an emotional statement, imploring the court to protect his son and expressing his anguish over feeling helpless during the ordeal. The father’s words left an indelible mark on those present, underscoring the lasting impact of such heinous acts on victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistant District Attorney Sarah Skiles, representing Monroe County, expressed her commitment to safeguarding children and ensuring that perpetrators of sexual assault face the consequences of their actions. She highlighted the tireless efforts of Investigator Paul Sloan, who played a crucial role in bringing Nelson-Koch to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles on this harrowing case, the community is left to ponder the necessary steps to prevent such incidents in the future. The 10-year sentence handed down to Nelson-Koch serves as a stark reminder that even in our most trusted institutions, vigilance is paramount to protect the most vulnerable among us.&lt;/p&gt;
