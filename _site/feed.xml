A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Shutdown Showdown - GOP and Democrats Lock Horns, Threatening Government Operations</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/30/Government-Shutdown-Showdown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shutdown Showdown - GOP and Democrats Lock Horns, Threatening Government Operations" /><published>2023-09-30T09:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-30T09:06:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/30/Government-Shutdown-Showdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/30/Government-Shutdown-Showdown/">&lt;p&gt;A looming government shutdown is making headlines as an unlikely alliance between rebel Republicans and Democrats has emerged, throwing a wrench into the government’s stopgap funding bill. The procedural vote to progress the bill had earlier been successful, but the final vote hit a wall, with 198 to 232 members opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uncommon-alliances-and-strained-relations&quot;&gt;Uncommon Alliances and Strained Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one Republicans, including high-profile names like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Nancy Mace, sided with the Democrats to tank the bill. This maneuvering dealt a severe blow to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who’s been juggling disagreements within his conference throughout this spending battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-ticking-clock&quot;&gt;A Ticking Clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With federal government funding expiring at the end of the day on September 30, the inability of the House and Senate to agree on a deal threatens to bring “nonessential” federal functions to a standstill. A temporary funding extension is desperately needed to allow lawmakers more time to consolidate individual spending bills for the fiscal year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conservative-standpoint&quot;&gt;The Conservative Standpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservatives are resisting any short-term funding extension, asserting it would simply prolong the influence of the previous Democratically controlled Congress. They’ve been particularly vocal about their objections to proposals that do not align with conservative policy, leading to intensified debates on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-maneuvering-and-accusations&quot;&gt;Political Maneuvering and Accusations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy and his allies have been trying to sway the dissenters, accusing them of empowering Democrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the White House. They argue that siding with Democrats gives the opposing party more leverage to pass government funding without incorporating conservative policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discord-and-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Discord and Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ongoing discord within the Republican party and between major political parties is causing uncertainty and pushing the government ever closer to a shutdown. A government closure seems increasingly likely, with no consensus on a short-term spending patch in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;senates-countermove&quot;&gt;Senate’s Countermove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Senate is formulating its own funding extension, planning to maintain current funding levels for 45 days while also allocating additional aid for Ukraine and U.S. disaster relief. However, McCarthy remains adamant about not introducing a short-term spending bill that includes Ukraine funding to the floor unless it also encompasses border security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fallout&quot;&gt;The Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent rebellion and the subsequent clash between GOP rebels and Democrats underscore the current volatile state of American politics. If a resolution is not reached promptly, essential government functions risk being paralyzed, affecting millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadlock over the government funding bill illustrates the deep-seated divisions and ideological clashes within and between the major political parties. As the clock ticks closer to a potential government shutdown, the ongoing debates and disagreements reflect the broader issues and challenges facing American democracy and governance. The real-world implications of this political showdown are vast, impacting governmental operations and the lives of everyday citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">A looming government shutdown is making headlines as an unlikely alliance between rebel Republicans and Democrats has emerged, throwing a wrench into the government’s stopgap funding bill.

Hollywood screenwriters, after a relentless 148-day strike, have clinched victory, managing to erect critical safeguards against the encroachment of AI in script writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai---a-friend-or-foe&quot;&gt;AI - A Friend or Foe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s rapid advancement in the realm of scriptwriting sparked fears, debates, and a determination among writers to protect their craft. Screenwriters rallied around the existential threat, ensuring that AI’s role in film writing remains transparent and secondary to human creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-just-about-credits&quot;&gt;Not Just About Credits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America (WGA) struck a preliminary deal mandating full disclosure from studios and production companies on AI’s involvement in any given material. The terms dictate AI can’t be credited, it can’t rewrite “literary material”, and AI-generated writing can’t be source material. The deal aims to make AI an ally rather than a usurper, with companies and writers working together harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tentative-accord&quot;&gt;A Tentative Accord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the groundbreaking agreement, both parties acknowledge the continually evolving nature of AI. The contract underscores the fast-evolving and uncertain legal landscape surrounding generative AI, leading to regular meetings between companies and the guild during the three-year contract term to adapt and refine the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-hollywood&quot;&gt;Beyond Hollywood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented strike and the resultant deal could serve as a beacon for other content creation industries. The deal forged by the WGA might become the blueprint for addressing similar concerns in visual arts, acting, and other creative sectors. In a world where AI can replicate a star’s likeness without permission or replace background actors entirely, safeguards are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-model-for-future-ai-engagements&quot;&gt;A Model for Future AI Engagements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WGA’s victory is a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of human and AI collaboration in the creative process. AI’s capacity is recognized, but it is the human spirit and creativity that are prized above all. This compromise ensures that AI serves as a complementary tool rather than a replacement, marking a significant stride in defining the relationship between humans and AI in the creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-debate-and-discussions&quot;&gt;Ongoing Debate and Discussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Writers Guild has won a significant battle, the war is far from over. This landmark agreement is just a stepping stone in the journey to understand and integrate AI in the creative world. The industry will need to regularly revisit the implications and applications of generative AI, adapting and evolving to safeguard human creativity while embracing technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-ahead&quot;&gt;The Path Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and practitioners alike will be keenly watching the developments in this domain, as this is a preliminary step in a much longer journey. The striking accord is a small yet monumental stride towards understanding and integrating AI in creative arts. It paints a picture of a future where humans and AI coexist and collaborate, creating a tapestry of experiences richer and more diverse than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The colorful, vibrant world of Hollywood is currently on the frontlines, not of a blockbuster war film, but of a real-life battle pitting human creatives against artificial intelligence (AI).

The remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia delivered relentless rainfall to the already saturated region, causing chaos and paralyzing daily life, predominantly in Brooklyn, where more than 6 inches of rain wreaked havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unprecedented-rainfall-shatters-records&quot;&gt;Unprecedented Rainfall Shatters Records&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn was particularly overwhelmed, receiving almost 7 inches of rain by midday, causing New York City Mayor Eric Adams to urge citizens to stay where they are and exercise extreme caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city witnessed rain totals ranging from 4 to 6 inches across Long Island and Hudson Valley, with some areas experiencing over 7 inches of rain. This catastrophic downpour has prompted Governor Kathy Hochul to declare a State of Emergency across the impacted regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subways-and-streets-submerged&quot;&gt;Subways and Streets Submerged&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless rains overpowered the city’s subway systems, leading to unprecedented disruptions to rail and bus services. The city’s infrastructure struggled to cope, with flooding easily exceeding the subway system’s maximum capacity to handle 1 inch of rainfall per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation was perilous for those on the roads, with several drivers stranded in floodwaters and major highways, parkways, and streets closed. Emergency services reported mud landslides in Lower Westchester’s hillier terrain, further escalating the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-airports-and-public-services&quot;&gt;Impact on Airports and Public Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive flooding also spilled into LaGuardia Airport, causing a shutdown of Terminal A and cutting access to the airport’s sole jet fuel storage facility. Despite these hindrances, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey affirmed that flights were still operating, albeit with intermittent ground stops anticipated due to the ongoing severe weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite her pioneering political journey, her approach to legislation and her policy decisions drew the ire of both conservatives and progressives, leading to scrutiny and reflections on the implications of her liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California had pre-existing laws safeguarding doctors who offer abortion services from judgments stemming from other states. However, the newly signed legislation amplifies the protection, ensuring authorities do not collaborate with out-of-state investigations into providers mailing abortion pills to other states. The law also prohibits bail agents or bounty hunters from detaining doctors and pharmacists in California and transporting them to another state to face trials for providing an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-lifeline-to-essential-care&quot;&gt;A Lifeline to Essential Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health care providers, physically located in California, will be able to offer a lifeline to people in states that have cut off access to essential care, and be shielded from the draconian laws of those states,” stated the bill’s author, Democrat state Sen. Nancy Skinner. The law, akin to those in New York and Massachusetts, even restricts state-based media companies, like Facebook, from cooperating with out-of-state investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-womens-rights&quot;&gt;A Stand for Women’s Rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Newsom, reinforcing his commitment to protecting women and health care workers providing basic care, signed this landmark bill, emphasizing California’s stance on women’s rights and medical freedom. This law is crucial for those seeking essential care, especially in states with stringent pro-life laws, thus enabling a supportive network for women in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boundaries-overstepped&quot;&gt;Boundaries Overstepped?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this monumental legislation hasn’t been welcomed by all. Pro-life groups, like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the law, asserting that the California government is disregarding state borders and imposing its will. They argued that California’s protections for abortion providers overshadow the diverse values and laws of other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-legislation&quot;&gt;Impact of the Legislation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new law shields health care providers within California, those leaving the state and prescribing abortion pills will not enjoy the protection offered by the law. This legislation not only fosters medical freedom and women’s rights but also invites discussions about state sovereignty and the extent to which one state can offer protections that might infringe upon the laws of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary bill signed by Gov. Newsom symbolizes a pivotal advancement in women’s health care rights and medical freedom. It facilitates the provision of essential care to those residing in pro-life states and asserts California’s stance on protecting women’s reproductive rights.

This steadfast loyalty surfaces amidst legal disputes and a recent ruling by a Manhattan judge on fraud allegations related to his business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-unyielding-fandom&quot;&gt;Trump’s Unyielding Fandom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll, undertaken for the New York Post by Leger, reveals a substantial 62% of GOP voters preferring Trump as the party’s nominee, overshadowing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who trails significantly at 10%. Notably, Trump’s support saw a 2% rise following his absence from the first debate, highlighting the unwavering allegiance from his voter base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the legal turbulence and the debate absenteeism, the stronghold of Trumpism seems unscathed. “I’ve sort of kind of had to convince myself nothing’s gonna surprise me anymore with that, with this individual, but I just think that there’s a strong segment of Republican voters that there’s not much that’s gonna sway them,” conveyed Andrew Enns, Leger’s Executive Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;views-from-the-other-side&quot;&gt;Views from the Other Side&lt;/h3&gt;

The visit shed light on the ongoing severe situations occurring under the international bridge in Eagle Pass, where numerous migrants are being held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-spotlight-on-the-crisis&quot;&gt;A Spotlight on the Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanticipated visit by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has brought a renewed focus on the worsening border situation. It seems that Musk and Rep. Gonzales were there to observe the conditions in which migrants are being detained. This area under the international bridge has been the center of attention due to the escalating number of migrants who cross and are subsequently held, awaiting transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Gonzales had hinted at a potential visit with Musk earlier in the day. “Can’t say anything, stay tuned!” was Gonzales’ suspense-filled message to Breitbart Texas. Musk himself subtly hinted at this visit in a previous post on ‘X’. The intrigue ended when Musk, along with several Texas sheriffs and Rep. Gonzales, was spotted at around 5:30 PM starting his visit under the international bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-situation-on-ground&quot;&gt;The Situation on Ground&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migrant detention area has become notorious for holding record numbers of migrants who, after crossing, are left in limbo as they await further transportation. This visibility of the Texas border crisis has seen numerous dignitaries and officials visit to witness the conditions first hand. Musk and Gonzales gathering with Texas sheriffs under the international bridge emphasizes the gravity of the ongoing crisis and the urgent need for resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

At the heart of the storm is a fiery confrontation between Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The clash transpired in a closed-door House GOP conference, with allegations and fiery words exchanged, offering a glimpse into the tempestuous relations within the GOP ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaetz-vs-mccarthy---a-battle-of-words&quot;&gt;Gaetz vs McCarthy - A Battle of Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heated encounter ensued as Gaetz accused McCarthy of orchestrating an online campaign to tarnish his reputation. Gaetz alleges that McCarthy employed “MAGA influencers” to post derogatory content about him on social media platforms. McCarthy, vehemently denying the accusations, dismissed Gaetz’s claims, stating he wouldn’t “waste his time” on such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rising-tensions-within&quot;&gt;Rising Tensions Within&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confrontation symbolizes more than just a personal squabble; it reflects the rising tensions and fragmented relations within the party. Other GOP members reportedly expressed their frustrations with Gaetz during the meeting, with one calling him to “f— off,” and another labeling him a “scumbag.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-war-of-accusations&quot;&gt;A War of Accusations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaetz seems unyielding in his stance, confronting McCarthy about the alleged payments to influencers. The strife continued as Gaetz claimed that McCarthy would rather focus on expanding the majority than resolving the alleged smear campaigns. A spokesperson for McCarthy refuted the involvement in any such campaigns, pointing instead to potential Democrat-backed initiatives against Gaetz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unresolved-allegations&quot;&gt;Unresolved Allegations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between Gaetz and McCarthy further intensifies as Gaetz threatens a floor vote to oust McCarthy from leadership positions due to alleged deal violations. The rising turmoil and unresolved allegations between the two showcase the increasing instability and discord within the GOP, with both parties remaining firm on their stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-on-governance&quot;&gt;Implications on Governance&lt;/h3&gt;
