A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-19T08:31:54-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T08:31:54-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Quentin Tarantino Surprises IDF Soldiers with Morale-Boosting Visit</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/10/19/Tarantino-Israel-Visit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quentin Tarantino Surprises IDF Soldiers with Morale-Boosting Visit" /><published>2023-10-19T08:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T08:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/10/19/Tarantino-Israel-Visit</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/10/19/Tarantino-Israel-Visit/">&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected gesture of support, esteemed film director Quentin Tarantino made an appearance at an Israeli military base last Friday. His visit aimed to uplift spirits and provide a morale boost to the soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) after they faced severe terror attacks in southern Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos capturing the iconic &lt;em&gt;Reservoir Dogs&lt;/em&gt; director’s visit showcased Tarantino in earnest discussions with the troops. One standout image featured him posing with IDF members against the backdrop of a military helicopter. These photographs quickly circulated on the Israel War Room X Twitter account. The post acknowledged, “Legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino visits an Israeli base in southern Israel to boost IDF morale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-profit group, &lt;em&gt;Stand With Us&lt;/em&gt;, also shared insights from the visit on their Instagram page. The post praised Tarantino’s significant gesture, stating, “Legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino showed his solidarity with the Israeli people by making a surprise visit to southern Israel, affected gravely by Hamas’ continuous terror war. Interacting with both soldiers and locals, he kindled a social media storm filled with selfies and videos, symbolizing his heartfelt support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tarantino, known for his masterpieces in cinema, has a deep personal connection to Israel. He resides in Tel Aviv with his wife, the Israeli singer Daniella Pick The couple tied the knot in 2018 after their first meeting in Israel back in 2009. Tarantino’s love for the country and its people is evident in his words, “I love the country, and the people are really nice, very nice to me, and they seem excited that I’m here.”&lt;/p&gt;

In 2021, Tarantino even experienced the threat of a Hamas rocket attack. On a lighter note, after this experience, his Israeli friends humorously claimed that he was now an “official Israeli.”&lt;/p&gt;

This comes after the February derailment of a freight train operated by the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern Corp. is now instructed to further investigate the presence of an oily sheen or film observed on water and sediments of two significant creeks in East Palestine. These creeks, known as the Sulphur Run and the &lt;strong&gt;Leslie Run&lt;/strong&gt;, have been showing signs of environmental impact post the mishap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA’s spokesperson stated, “The work executed following this order will essentially determine the need for further cleanup to negate any possible long-term repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated in February when the train, approaching the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, derailed, leading to a colossal fire. To manage the aftermath, Ohio performed a controlled release of hazardous chemicals at the site merely three days post the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide a clearer picture of the extent of the environmental damage, the EPA’s investigation aims to span approximately five miles, focusing especially on the affected sections of the mentioned creeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA Regional Administrator, Debra Shore emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating, “With this directive, Norfolk Southern is expected to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the waterways, ensuring there are zero long-term adverse effects stemming from the derailment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restoration strategy also encompasses the cleaning of various culverts. This is to eliminate any affected sediment in Sulphur Run, particularly downstream of where the derailment transpired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the new mandate, Norfolk Southern Corp. expressed its intent to collaborate, remarking that this directive essentially “formalizes the work that has been in progress post the derailment, albeit under a distinct regulatory framework.” The company reiterated its commitment, highlighting its ongoing collaboration with both the EPA and Ohio EPA. They concluded by assuring their relentless efforts to mitigate the derailment’s impacts on the Sulphur and Leslie Runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative by the EPA reflects the agency’s continued commitment to protecting and preserving environmental quality, especially in the aftermath of unforeseen incidents.

His wife, Nadine Menendez, along with three other co-defendants, has pleaded not guilty to the allegations in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges revolve around a supposed &lt;strong&gt;bribery scheme&lt;/strong&gt; that involves Senator Menendez, his wife, and businessmen Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes. Accusations detail that these individuals participated in a plot benefiting both Senator Menendez and the Egyptian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intricacies of the case date back to 2018 through 2022, with the indictment suggesting a “corrupt relationship” between Menendez, his wife, and the mentioned businessmen. Allegedly, the couple accepted vast sums - totaling “hundreds of thousands of dollars” - in bribes. In return, Senator Menendez purportedly leveraged his senatorial influence to support and enrich the three businessmen and the Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Senator is unwavering in his stand, asserting his loyalty and commitment to the United States. He expressed his commitment to “human rights and democracy in Egypt” and vehemently denied the allegations. Senator Menendez emphasized his history of challenging Egypt’s leadership on human rights matters and declared his unyielding allegiance to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” stated Menendez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further labeled the new charges as mere tactics to wear him down but remains determined to defend his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Piling new charge upon new charge does not make the allegations true… I again ask people who know me and my record to give me the chance to present my defense and show my innocence,” Menendez voiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while the senator’s wife and the businessmen face the recent charges head-on, Senator Menendez himself is slated for another court appearance on Monday. This rescheduling follows an additional charge, termed a “superseding indictment,” brought against him, his wife, and Hana, a New Jersey businessman of Egyptian origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high-profile case continues to capture national attention, with implications for the Democratic party and the broader political landscape.

Former President Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over current President Joe Biden, while businessman and Navy SEAL veteran Tim Sheehy is poised to challenge Senator Jon Tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emerson College Poll, unveiled on Tuesday, delves into hypothetical election scenarios and Montana’s political landscape. The numbers indicate that 49% of Montana’s registered voters would back Trump, compared to Biden’s 28% in a prospective 2020 rerun. Diving deeper, 16% would opt for another contender, leaving a mere 7% on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same poll paints a dim picture for Biden’s performance, with only 22% endorsing his presidency. A whopping 63% disapprove, casting a cloud over his standing in the Treasure State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When posed with the hypothetical question of changing allegiance in the next few months, 53% of Trump enthusiasts appear unwavering in their commitment, believing Trump can do no wrong. Conversely, a slightly lesser 48% of Biden supporters echo this steadfast loyalty. The remaining voters are susceptible to swaying, given certain actions or statements by their initially preferred candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching gears to the Senate race, Sheehy, armed with several Republican senator endorsements, presents a noteworthy challenge to Tester. Tester, currently in his third senatorial term, attracts 39% of voter support. Yet, Sheehy, relatively green in the political arena, is hot on his heels with 35%. A noteworthy 20% remain undecided, with the remaining 6% leaning towards other candidates. Significantly, the differences are within the 4.6% credibility margin for registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerson’s findings underline a distinct gender divide in voter preference. Tester commands the women’s vote with a lead of 16 points (46% to 30%), while Sheehy secures a 40% to 32% lead among men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) is rumored to be mulling a bid for Tester’s seat. However, Trump has previously indicated he wouldn’t support Rosendale in a primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this Emerson College poll was conducted from October 1-4, encompassing views of 499 Montanans, 447 of whom are registered voters. The credibility interval stands at 4.4% for the total sample and 4.6% for registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

His stance? Leave it to the voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Newsmax town hall held in Iowa, Pence conveyed his belief that decisions concerning Trump’s alleged interference in the 2020 election results should be determined by the voters and not the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject is deeply personal for Pence, as he recalled the events of January 6, 2021, a day he labeled a “tragic day”. On this date, Pence oversaw the Congress’ certification of the Electoral College, during which the Capitol Building experienced a breach by protesters. Speaking on the event, Pence expressed, “By God’s grace, I did my duty that day under the Constitution of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pence’s stance on the handling of Trump’s fate is distinct from the general political discourse. He voiced his hope that “issues around the president’s conduct and actions on that day and leading up to that day would be left to the judgment of the American people and not be brought into the courts of this country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes amidst Trump facing legal repercussions, with a four-count indictment in Washington, D.C., and a 13-count indictment in Georgia. Both relate to his alleged endeavors to overturn the 2020 election results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Trump and Pence has shown signs of strain, primarily due to differences in their recounting of events on January 6th. Pence maintains that Trump had urged him to reverse the voters’ decision, while Trump insists that he simply wanted a delay in certification to further investigate claims of voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing his past relationship with Trump, Pence stated, “We haven’t talked in a while, but we used to talk and work together every day for the better part of five years in a campaign and in our administration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the palpable tension and the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, Pence maintains his belief that voters, and not legal systems, should be the final arbiters. He concluded, “I’d like to see these issues resolved by voters, by the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former Vice President and current Republican presidential candidate, Mike Pence, shared his perspective on how former President Donald Trump’s actions surrounding the 2020 election should be judged. His stance? Leave it to the voters. In a Newsmax town hall held in Iowa, Pence conveyed his belief that decisions concerning Trump’s alleged interference in the 2020 election results should be determined by the voters and not the courts. The subject is deeply personal for Pence, as he recalled the events of January 6, 2021, a day he labeled a “tragic day”. On this date, Pence oversaw the Congress’ certification of the Electoral College, during which the Capitol Building experienced a breach by protesters. Speaking on the event, Pence expressed, “By God’s grace, I did my duty that day under the Constitution of the United States.” However, Pence’s stance on the handling of Trump’s fate is distinct from the general political discourse. He voiced his hope that “issues around the president’s conduct and actions on that day and leading up to that day would be left to the judgment of the American people and not be brought into the courts of this country.” This comes amidst Trump facing legal repercussions, with a four-count indictment in Washington, D.C., and a 13-count indictment in Georgia. Both relate to his alleged endeavors to overturn the 2020 election results. The relationship between Trump and Pence has shown signs of strain, primarily due to differences in their recounting of events on January 6th. Pence maintains that Trump had urged him to reverse the voters’ decision, while Trump insists that he simply wanted a delay in certification to further investigate claims of voter fraud. Discussing his past relationship with Trump, Pence stated, “We haven’t talked in a while, but we used to talk and work together every day for the better part of five years in a campaign and in our administration.” Despite the palpable tension and the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, Pence maintains his belief that voters, and not legal systems, should be the final arbiters. He concluded, “I’d like to see these issues resolved by voters, by the American people.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’ Saga: New Charges Loom as Case Reopens</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/10/18/Baldwin-Rust-Case-Revival/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’ Saga: New Charges Loom as Case Reopens" /><published>2023-10-18T12:58:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-18T12:58:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/10/18/Baldwin-Rust-Case-Revival</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/10/18/Baldwin-Rust-Case-Revival/">&lt;p&gt;In a turn of events that has gripped Hollywood, actor Alec Baldwin might be staring down new charges in relation to the tragic shooting that took place on the set of the movie “Rust” two years ago. New Mexico’s legal authorities have signalled their intention to present fresh evidence to a grand jury, breathing new life into a case that many believed had reached its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, prosecutors had shelved the involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin. However, the tables seem to have turned again with the statement, “additional facts have come to light”, hinting at an extended investigation that unfolded over recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this case particularly harrowing for the film industry is the loss of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, whose life was cut short when a gun discharged in Baldwin’s hand during a rehearsal. Joel Souza, the director of “Rust”, was also injured in this unfortunate incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual nature of these potential new charges remains shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, reports from the New York Times indicate that the gun involved in the incident has undergone further analysis. Special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis, shedding light on the matter, stated that the newfound evidence might suggest “Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This announcement has sparked intense reactions from various quarters. Baldwin’s legal team, led by Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, has been vocal about their disappointment, referring to the renewed interest in prosecution as a “misguided” move. Their statement read, “It is unfortunate that a terrible tragedy has been turned into this misguided prosecution. We will answer any charges in court.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the legal cloud hovering over it, “Rust” resumed its production in Montana earlier this year, and Baldwin rejoined the crew to complete the film. The release date for this indie western, however, remains undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case has been a rollercoaster for Alec Baldwin, who has consistently asserted that the gun’s firing was unintentional. Aside from the looming criminal charges, Baldwin is also grappling with multiple civil lawsuits in connection to the on-set catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In a turn of events that has gripped Hollywood, actor Alec Baldwin might be staring down new charges in relation to the tragic shooting that took place on the set of the movie “Rust” two years ago.

The move followed a tragic explosion at a Gaza hospital, claiming hundreds of lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House announced that Biden would now only be visiting Israel, putting off his anticipated trip to Jordan. Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had previously pulled out from the summit, condemning the attacks which the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza attributed to an Israeli airstrike. However, the Israeli military denied any involvement, pointing to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s response was unequivocal. Their foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, expressed deep concerns on a state-run network about the ongoing war and aggression, pushing the region towards a precipice. He emphasized that Jordan would consider hosting the summit only when all involved parties are on the same page, primarily focusing on halting the war, respecting Palestinian humanity, and delivering deserved aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation underscores a mounting challenge for President Biden. As the leader of a superpower nation, the eyes of the world watch his every move. In a region fraught with tensions, Biden’s decision to personally visit showcases his commitment to a central role for the U.S. on the global stage, banking on personal diplomacy as a decisive instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Biden’s approach, Jon Alterman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies remarked, “This is how Joe Biden believes politics works and history is made.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the humanitarian crisis escalating, concerns are mounting over the potential expansion of the conflict beyond Gaza’s borders. Already there have been encounters on Israel’s northern frontier with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed faction stationed in Southern Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s journey to the region is fraught with potential pitfalls. Other U.S. officials’ visits have been disrupted due to rocket attacks into Israel. Further Israeli airstrikes in Gaza could intensify global condemnation just as Biden aims to fortify ties with a key ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has subtly been amplifying its call for humanitarian assistance in Gaza amidst ongoing support for Israel. This dual stance arises from fears of worsening conditions in Gaza, leading to diminished Arab tolerance for Israel’s military actions. Such a scenario could significantly bolster Hamas and even inspire Iran to escalate its anti-Israel endeavors, potentially igniting a broader regional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to bring relief, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been working diligently with both Arab and Israeli leadership. His recent efforts resulted in an agreement outlining a strategy for humanitarian aid distribution in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst these global dynamics, Biden remains steadfast in his commitment to allies. When asked about the simultaneous crises in Israel and Ukraine on CBS’ “60 Minutes”, he resolutely stated, “We’re the United States of America…We have the capacity to do this and we have an obligation to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming days, Biden is set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other key officials. However, meetings with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas have been shelved.&lt;/p&gt;

Fugees Rapper Cries Foul</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/10/18/AI-In-Courtroom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Misuse of AI in the Courtroom?

However, the question arises - is the courtroom a suitable place for AI to play a role? The recent case of Pras Michel, a member of the iconic hip-hop group Fugees, brings this debate to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michel, who faced charges relating to an elaborate scheme to funnel millions in foreign funds for illicit lobbying and illegal campaign contributions allegedly at China’s behest, was convicted in April. But now, the rapper seeks a new trial. Why? He claims his then-defense attorney, David Kenner, leaned on “an experimental AI program” for his closing arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alleged AI-powered argument, according to Michel, was riddled with baseless points, misconstrued the issues at hand, and glaringly overlooked critical weaknesses in the Government’s case against him. But it doesn’t stop there. Kenner allegedly took pride in the speed and efficiency of the AI tool, boasting that it condensed “hours or days of legal work into seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s even more alarming is the potential conflict of interest. It’s reported that Kenner and his co-counsel had an undisclosed financial interest in the very AI program they used during Michel’s trial. Their intention? To plug the software in a press release following the trial’s conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation raises eyebrows and ethical concerns. An attorney’s duty is to zealously represent their client and to ensure that their rights are preserved throughout the legal process. Relying on untested technology, especially with ulterior motives, might compromise this fundamental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novelty of the AI’s application was seemingly not lost on Kenner. A press release by Eyelevel, an AI firm, in May stated that its technology “made history” by being the first instance of “generative AI in a federal trial.” Kenner himself hailed the AI’s capabilities as a “game changer for complex litigation.” Yet, for all its groundbreaking status, the very same press release glossed over the fact that Michel was found guilty on all counts after just three days of jury deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial was not just another case. It spanned three weeks and included testimonies from A-list celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Given the case’s gravity, one would expect nothing less than a meticulous, human touch to every aspect of the defense, including the closing arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where does this leave us? While technology, including AI, undoubtedly has immense potential benefits, its application must be judicious. The courtroom, where lives and liberties hang in the balance, is not a place for experimentation or showcasing tech prowess, especially not at the expense of a defendant’s right to a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the court will react to Michel’s appeal. But this case serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of blind faith in technology in the legal domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In an age where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, the legal realm is not immune.
