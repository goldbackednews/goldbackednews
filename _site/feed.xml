A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Hollywood Scribes Triumph Over AI - For Now</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/30/Hollywood-Writers-AI/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hollywood Scribes Triumph Over AI - For Now" /><published>2023-09-30T08:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-30T08:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/30/Hollywood-Writers-AI</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/30/Hollywood-Writers-AI/">&lt;p&gt;The colorful, vibrant world of Hollywood is currently on the frontlines, not of a blockbuster war film, but of a real-life battle pitting human creatives against artificial intelligence (AI). Hollywood screenwriters, after a relentless 148-day strike, have clinched victory, managing to erect critical safeguards against the encroachment of AI in script writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai---a-friend-or-foe&quot;&gt;AI - A Friend or Foe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s rapid advancement in the realm of scriptwriting sparked fears, debates, and a determination among writers to protect their craft. Screenwriters rallied around the existential threat, ensuring that AI’s role in film writing remains transparent and secondary to human creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-just-about-credits&quot;&gt;Not Just About Credits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America (WGA) struck a preliminary deal mandating full disclosure from studios and production companies on AI’s involvement in any given material. The terms dictate AI can’t be credited, it can’t rewrite “literary material”, and AI-generated writing can’t be source material. The deal aims to make AI an ally rather than a usurper, with companies and writers working together harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tentative-accord&quot;&gt;A Tentative Accord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the groundbreaking agreement, both parties acknowledge the continually evolving nature of AI. The contract underscores the fast-evolving and uncertain legal landscape surrounding generative AI, leading to regular meetings between companies and the guild during the three-year contract term to adapt and refine the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-hollywood&quot;&gt;Beyond Hollywood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented strike and the resultant deal could serve as a beacon for other content creation industries. The deal forged by the WGA might become the blueprint for addressing similar concerns in visual arts, acting, and other creative sectors. In a world where AI can replicate a star’s likeness without permission or replace background actors entirely, safeguards are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-model-for-future-ai-engagements&quot;&gt;A Model for Future AI Engagements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WGA’s victory is a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of human and AI collaboration in the creative process. AI’s capacity is recognized, but it is the human spirit and creativity that are prized above all. This compromise ensures that AI serves as a complementary tool rather than a replacement, marking a significant stride in defining the relationship between humans and AI in the creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-debate-and-discussions&quot;&gt;Ongoing Debate and Discussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Writers Guild has won a significant battle, the war is far from over. This landmark agreement is just a stepping stone in the journey to understand and integrate AI in the creative world. The industry will need to regularly revisit the implications and applications of generative AI, adapting and evolving to safeguard human creativity while embracing technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-ahead&quot;&gt;The Path Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and practitioners alike will be keenly watching the developments in this domain, as this is a preliminary step in a much longer journey. The striking accord is a small yet monumental stride towards understanding and integrating AI in creative arts. It paints a picture of a future where humans and AI coexist and collaborate, creating a tapestry of experiences richer and more diverse than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The colorful, vibrant world of Hollywood is currently on the frontlines, not of a blockbuster war film, but of a real-life battle pitting human creatives against artificial intelligence (AI).

The remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia delivered relentless rainfall to the already saturated region, causing chaos and paralyzing daily life, predominantly in Brooklyn, where more than 6 inches of rain wreaked havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unprecedented-rainfall-shatters-records&quot;&gt;Unprecedented Rainfall Shatters Records&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn was particularly overwhelmed, receiving almost 7 inches of rain by midday, causing New York City Mayor Eric Adams to urge citizens to stay where they are and exercise extreme caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city witnessed rain totals ranging from 4 to 6 inches across Long Island and Hudson Valley, with some areas experiencing over 7 inches of rain. This catastrophic downpour has prompted Governor Kathy Hochul to declare a State of Emergency across the impacted regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subways-and-streets-submerged&quot;&gt;Subways and Streets Submerged&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless rains overpowered the city’s subway systems, leading to unprecedented disruptions to rail and bus services. The city’s infrastructure struggled to cope, with flooding easily exceeding the subway system’s maximum capacity to handle 1 inch of rainfall per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation was perilous for those on the roads, with several drivers stranded in floodwaters and major highways, parkways, and streets closed. Emergency services reported mud landslides in Lower Westchester’s hillier terrain, further escalating the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-airports-and-public-services&quot;&gt;Impact on Airports and Public Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive flooding also spilled into LaGuardia Airport, causing a shutdown of Terminal A and cutting access to the airport’s sole jet fuel storage facility. Despite these hindrances, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey affirmed that flights were still operating, albeit with intermittent ground stops anticipated due to the ongoing severe weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Public Schools persisted with their sessions, confident in ensuring the students’ safe return home amidst the challenging conditions.

Despite her pioneering political journey, her approach to legislation and her policy decisions drew the ire of both conservatives and progressives, leading to scrutiny and reflections on the implications of her liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-proponent-of-controversial-gun-control&quot;&gt;A Proponent of Controversial Gun Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s political narrative is steeped in advocacy for stringent gun control, originating from her experiences with the assassinations of Harvey Milk and George Moscone.

&lt;p&gt;While her election to the U.S. Senate in 1992 marked the “Year of the Woman,” Feinstein’s subsequent tenure revealed a more partisan bent.

&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s “moderate” stance faced backlash from the more radical elements within her party.

This significant legislation extends the already existing law in California that protects doctors providing abortion services to out-of-state patients traveling to California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extending-protection-to-providers&quot;&gt;Extending Protection to Providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California had pre-existing laws safeguarding doctors who offer abortion services from judgments stemming from other states. However, the newly signed legislation amplifies the protection, ensuring authorities do not collaborate with out-of-state investigations into providers mailing abortion pills to other states. The law also prohibits bail agents or bounty hunters from detaining doctors and pharmacists in California and transporting them to another state to face trials for providing an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-lifeline-to-essential-care&quot;&gt;A Lifeline to Essential Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health care providers, physically located in California, will be able to offer a lifeline to people in states that have cut off access to essential care, and be shielded from the draconian laws of those states,” stated the bill’s author, Democrat state Sen. Nancy Skinner. The law, akin to those in New York and Massachusetts, even restricts state-based media companies, like Facebook, from cooperating with out-of-state investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-womens-rights&quot;&gt;A Stand for Women’s Rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Newsom, reinforcing his commitment to protecting women and health care workers providing basic care, signed this landmark bill, emphasizing California’s stance on women’s rights and medical freedom. This law is crucial for those seeking essential care, especially in states with stringent pro-life laws, thus enabling a supportive network for women in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boundaries-overstepped&quot;&gt;Boundaries Overstepped?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this monumental legislation hasn’t been welcomed by all. Pro-life groups, like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the law, asserting that the California government is disregarding state borders and imposing its will. They argued that California’s protections for abortion providers overshadow the diverse values and laws of other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-legislation&quot;&gt;Impact of the Legislation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new law shields health care providers within California, those leaving the state and prescribing abortion pills will not enjoy the protection offered by the law. This legislation not only fosters medical freedom and women’s rights but also invites discussions about state sovereignty and the extent to which one state can offer protections that might infringe upon the laws of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary bill signed by Gov. Newsom symbolizes a pivotal advancement in women’s health care rights and medical freedom. It facilitates the provision of essential care to those residing in pro-life states and asserts California’s stance on protecting women’s reproductive rights.

The visit shed light on the ongoing severe situations occurring under the international bridge in Eagle Pass, where numerous migrants are being held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-spotlight-on-the-crisis&quot;&gt;A Spotlight on the Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanticipated visit by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has brought a renewed focus on the worsening border situation. It seems that Musk and Rep. Gonzales were there to observe the conditions in which migrants are being detained. This area under the international bridge has been the center of attention due to the escalating number of migrants who cross and are subsequently held, awaiting transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Gonzales had hinted at a potential visit with Musk earlier in the day. “Can’t say anything, stay tuned!” was Gonzales’ suspense-filled message to Breitbart Texas.

At the heart of the storm is a fiery confrontation between Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The clash transpired in a closed-door House GOP conference, with allegations and fiery words exchanged, offering a glimpse into the tempestuous relations within the GOP ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaetz-vs-mccarthy---a-battle-of-words&quot;&gt;Gaetz vs McCarthy - A Battle of Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heated encounter ensued as Gaetz accused McCarthy of orchestrating an online campaign to tarnish his reputation. Gaetz alleges that McCarthy employed “MAGA influencers” to post derogatory content about him on social media platforms. McCarthy, vehemently denying the accusations, dismissed Gaetz’s claims, stating he wouldn’t “waste his time” on such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rising-tensions-within&quot;&gt;Rising Tensions Within&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confrontation symbolizes more than just a personal squabble; it reflects the rising tensions and fragmented relations within the party. Other GOP members reportedly expressed their frustrations with Gaetz during the meeting, with one calling him to “f— off,” and another labeling him a “scumbag.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-war-of-accusations&quot;&gt;A War of Accusations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaetz seems unyielding in his stance, confronting McCarthy about the alleged payments to influencers. The strife continued as Gaetz claimed that McCarthy would rather focus on expanding the majority than resolving the alleged smear campaigns. A spokesperson for McCarthy refuted the involvement in any such campaigns, pointing instead to potential Democrat-backed initiatives against Gaetz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unresolved-allegations&quot;&gt;Unresolved Allegations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between Gaetz and McCarthy further intensifies as Gaetz threatens a floor vote to oust McCarthy from leadership positions due to alleged deal violations. The rising turmoil and unresolved allegations between the two showcase the increasing instability and discord within the GOP, with both parties remaining firm on their stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-on-governance&quot;&gt;Implications on Governance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal strife comes at a pivotal time, with crucial government decisions and legislations on the line, affecting the party’s collective stance and ability to navigate through pressing issues.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
