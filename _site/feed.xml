A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/11/08/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-11-08T20:10:17-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-08T20:10:17-05:00</updated><id>/2023/11/08/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/11/08/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Supreme Court Leans Toward Upholding Gun Ban for Domestic Violence Restraining Orders</title><link href="/politics/2023/11/08/Supreme-Court-Gun-Law/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Supreme Court Leans Toward Upholding Gun Ban for Domestic Violence Restraining Orders" /><published>2023-11-08T06:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-08T06:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/11/08/Supreme-Court-Gun-Law</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/11/08/Supreme-Court-Gun-Law/">&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court signaled support for maintaining a federal law that restricts gun ownership for individuals with domestic violence restraining orders. This stance emerged during a session where justices engaged in a rigorous oral argument, dissecting the intricacies of the Second Amendment and its application in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case in question, U.S. v. Rahimi, could have extensive repercussions, stretching its influence to various gun rights legislations and potentially affecting the ongoing legal battle faced by Hunter Biden. The son of the President, Biden is gearing up to challenge a federal indictment which alleges he lied about his drug addiction when acquiring a firearm in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas man central to the Supreme Court case, Zackey Rahimi, faced charges stemming from multiple incidents involving firearms, leading to a restraining order that prohibited him from possessing a gun. His appeal put into question the constitutionality of such federal restrictions, arguing that they contravene his right to self-defense as afforded by the Second Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussions, Justice Elena Kagan and others stressed the government’s rationale that history has shown the necessity of keeping firearms from individuals deemed dangerous. Such a viewpoint finds support across the Court’s ideological spectrum, including the more conservative justices, suggesting a potential consensus for upholding the existing ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts, however, expressed concerns over the breadth of the term “irresponsible” when applied to gun ownership, hinting at the subjective nature of deeming someone unfit to bear arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background of the case paints a troubling picture of Rahimi’s repeated violations of the protective order, including brandishing weapons and threatening behavior. These actions did not escape the Court’s attention, with even the conservative justices questioning Rahimi’s suitability to possess firearms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the courthouse steps, demonstrators rallied, with the majority advocating for stricter gun control, reflecting the national conversation on gun violence following recent tragic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s eventual decision will likely be nuanced, focusing narrowly on the legitimacy of denying guns to those with a documented history of violence. Yet, it will set a critical precedent for future Second Amendment challenges and provide guidance for lower courts currently navigating the complex legal landscape post the landmark 2022 ruling, which expanded gun rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome will be closely watched by all, from legal scholars to policymakers to everyday citizens, as it will not only impact public safety and individual rights but also resonate through the ongoing societal debate about the balance between liberty and protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the nation awaits the Court’s ruling, due by the summer of 2024, the significance of this case extends beyond the legal arguments presented—it embodies the enduring struggle to reconcile the foundational principles of the Constitution with the pressing demands of modern governance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Supreme Court signaled support for maintaining a federal law that restricts gun ownership for individuals with domestic violence restraining orders.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ strategy to portray himself as the sole viable challenger to Trump has been met with skepticism from the Trump team, indicating a growing confidence in their frontrunner status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s spokesperson, Steven Cheung, threw a sharp jab at DeSantis by referring to him as “DeSanctimonious” and criticizing his campaign’s focus on attacking fellow GOP contender Nikki Haley. The Trump campaign’s rhetoric suggests a belief that DeSantis is losing his footing in the primary race, as indicated by Cheung’s metaphor of a “wounded bird” plummeting from the political skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfolding dynamics underscore the heated competition that characterizes the Republican field. While DeSantis’ campaign has worked diligently to frame the race as a direct face-off with Trump, Trump’s camp remains unfazed, bolstered by consistent polling leads. The endorsement from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a significant political figure, has added fuel to DeSantis’ campaign fire. However, Trump’s team remains confident that their candidate’s broad appeal and political track record will continue to resonate with Republican voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki Haley’s rising poll numbers in key primary states such as New Hampshire and South Carolina have prompted the Trump campaign to question DeSantis’ assertion of a two-man race. It’s a clear indicator of the fluid nature of the primary landscape and the potential for other candidates to disrupt the perceived duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s enduring popularity among the GOP base has been further reinforced by his unprecedented situation as a former president who has been indicted. Far from diminishing his political capital, the indictments have seemingly galvanized his support within the party. His campaign has adeptly turned these legal challenges into a rallying cry for his supporters, who view him as a political fighter undeterred by opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Trump’s financial clout now stands at a robust $3.1 billion, an ascension attributed largely to the surging real estate market in the Sunshine State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of Trump’s iconic Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and the prestigious Doral golf resort in Miami have both benefitted from Florida’s property boom, contributing substantially to his wealth’s upward trajectory. With the sale of his storied Washington hotel and a strategic reduction of liabilities, Trump boasts a stronger cash position and a lighter debt load than he’s held over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Bloomberg hints that Trump’s wealth could eclipse the current estimate of $3.1 billion. It concedes that factors such as the Trump brand’s influence, the historical significance of his holdings, and potential redevelopment or rezoning opportunities may significantly inflate property valuations. These considerations, in tandem with Trump’s strategic real estate moves, underscore his acumen as a property mogul with an unparalleled understanding of the market’s nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that estimates of Trump’s wealth have been a point of contention, often diverging between his own assessments and those of external appraisers. While the New York Attorney General’s lawsuit against the former president pegs his wealth at a lower figure, real estate professionals in Palm Beach have voiced surprise at the undervaluation of Mar-a-Lago, suggesting it could command a market price well into the hundreds of millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate extends to the valuation of Trump’s penthouse in Trump Tower, with Trump’s company asserting a value of $131.3 million in contrast to Bloomberg’s $40 million estimate and the lack of an official court assessment. The intricacies of New York real estate law allow for a broader interpretation of square footage, potentially inflating the size and worth of such a unique and iconic property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the complexity, any potential sale of Trump’s penthouse could fetch a premium, not solely due to its luxury but also the prestige associated with the Trump name. Trump supporters, in particular, might be willing to pay top dollar for a piece of the former president’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Bloomberg Billionaires Index grapples with the fluid nature of real estate valuations, influenced by factors like interest rates and market trends, it acknowledges the possibility that Trump’s wealth could indeed align with his own claims — or even surpass them. This financial narrative is not just a reflection of numbers but also of Trump’s indelible mark on the real estate sector, a legacy that began reshaping New York’s skyline as early as the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the landscape of American entrepreneurship and real estate development, Trump’s increasing fortune is more than a figure — it’s a chapter in the storied history of a businessman who rose to the pinnacle of political power and continues to command a towering presence in both arenas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a striking testament to his enduring business savvy, former President Donald Trump’s net worth has seen a significant uptick, swelling by an impressive $500 million since he bid farewell to the Oval Office.

The survey, resonating with the conservative base, shows Trump’s robust standing with more than half of likely GOP primary voters ready to cast their vote in his favor today, should the opportunity arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s staunch lead in the CBS poll underscores the unshakable loyalty and enthusiasm he commands within the Republican Party. With a whopping 61% of likely GOP primary voters backing him, Trump towers over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who currently stands at 18%, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who trails with 9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll not only highlights Trump’s lead in primary preferences but also showcases his perceived electability against President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. A striking 69% of those surveyed believe Trump is the candidate most likely to reclaim the White House for the Republicans, further solidifying his frontrunner status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fervor among Trump supporters is palpable, with an overwhelming 81% expressing they would “enthusiastically support” him if he becomes the Republican nominee. This contrasts sharply with the 21% of likely GOP primary voters favoring other candidates who would share the same level of enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reservations and party loyalty always play a role in politics, the CBS poll indicates that Trump’s base remains unyielding. Not a single Trump supporter from the survey stated they would withdraw their support if he secures the nomination. In contrast, 18% of likely GOP voters who support a different candidate are firm on not voting for Trump in the 2024 presidential race even if he were the party’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBS News and YouGov poll, conducted from October 31 to November 3, 2023, included a sample of 2,185 adult US residents and specifically honed in on 556 likely Republican primary voters. The margin of error stands at +/- 2.7 percentage points for the full sample and expands to +/- 5.5 percentage points for the subset of likely GOP primary voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are a clear testament to the power and influence Trump continues to wield in the political arena. As the conservative community looks toward the upcoming election cycle, it’s evident that Trump’s leadership and vision still resonate deeply with a vast majority of Republican voters who are ready to march to the polls with his banner held high.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the clock ticks closer to the first Republican caucus in Iowa next year, a new CBS News poll has cemented former President Donald Trump’s formidable lead among GOP hopefuls. The survey, resonating with the conservative base, shows Trump’s robust standing with more than half of likely GOP primary voters ready to cast their vote in his favor today, should the opportunity arise. Trump’s staunch lead in the CBS poll underscores the unshakable loyalty and enthusiasm he commands within the Republican Party. With a whopping 61% of likely GOP primary voters backing him, Trump towers over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who currently stands at 18%, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who trails with 9%. The poll not only highlights Trump’s lead in primary preferences but also showcases his perceived electability against President Joe Biden in the 2024 election.

The ADP National Employment Report revealed a paltry addition of 113,000 jobs last month, falling substantially short of the anticipated 150,000. This miss has sent shockwaves through the economy, casting a dark shadow on the Biden administration’s ability to manage our nation’s financial well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For months, the American people have been promised a strong and resilient economy under Democratic leadership. Yet, time and time again, we are met with underperformance and excuses. The labor market, once a beacon of prosperity, is now showing signs of strain. While some may argue that the market remains tight, the consistent failure to meet payroll expectations tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes, totaling 525 basis points since March 2022, were intended to bolster the economy. However, the effects have been anything but positive. Consumers’ views on the labor market, despite what the Conference Board may suggest, are dwindling. The Democratic leadership’s inability to navigate these tumultuous waters has left the American workforce in a state of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This payroll miss is not just a number; it is a reflection of a larger issue at hand. The Biden administration’s policies and lack of foresight have direct consequences on the livelihoods of American citizens. The ongoing strikes by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, resulting in at least 30,000 members off the job, are a testament to the unrest and dissatisfaction brewing under Democratic rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we brace ourselves for the Labor Department’s upcoming employment report, it is crucial to remember that these numbers are not just statistics. They represent the lives and well-being of American workers. The anticipated slowdown in private payrolls, especially in manufacturing, is a direct result of the current administration’s failure to adequately address and resolve labor disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time for accountability is now. The American people deserve a government that is committed to their prosperity and well-being. The underwhelming October payroll numbers are a stark reminder that the Democratic leadership is not up to the task. It is imperative that we demand better, hold our leaders accountable, and work towards a future where the American workforce is strong, resilient, and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of this payroll miss, let us not forget the real victims here: the American workers. They deserve better than broken promises and missed expectations. They deserve a leadership that is committed to their success and a government that works for them. The October payroll numbers are a call to action, a plea for change, and a reminder that the time for Democratic rule must come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">U.S. private payrolls have significantly missed the mark this October, further exposing the ineptitude of the current Democratic leadership.

This bomb isn’t just any addition to America’s military arsenal; it’s a colossal titan of destruction, capable of wiping out millions in a blink with a force 23 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense paints this development as a move to “strengthen deterrence of adversaries and assurance of allies.” It’s a message clear as day to anyone paying attention: the United States intends to maintain its status as the apex military power with unmatched capabilities. The Biden administration asserts that such developments provide “additional options against certain harder and large-area military targets.” But the underlying tone is one of severe warning — to adversaries both veiled and overt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gravity of the B61-13’s destructive capability is not lost on experts. Professor and historian of nuclear technology, Alex Wellerstein, offers a sobering visualization of the potential catastrophe. A theoretical detonation over Manhattan would result in upwards of 3.2 million casualties, decimating the population. Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C.—no major city is spared in these harrowing scenarios. Each model tells a tale of unthinkable horror, with national icons like the White House and Capitol building reduced to dust alongside countless American lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stark reality of such weaponry can feel distant, but the implications are deeply personal. These bombs, though developed for deterrence, hold the stories of cities, of communities, of individual lives within their theoretical blast radii. For conservative audiences, the narrative is twofold: a strong national defense is imperative, yet the moral and ethical weight of wielding such power must be handled with the utmost responsibility and discernment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world watches, questions about global security and the arms race resurface. The gravity bomb’s development may be a strategic move in the chessboard of international politics, but it’s a stark reminder of the devastating potential of nuclear weapons. The United States has always been a champion of strength, yet with strength comes the responsibility to lead with wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The B61-13 gravity bomb symbolizes a crossroads — a choice between further armament and the search for lasting peace. It’s a choice that resonates with every American, conservative or otherwise, as the nation grapples with the role it plays on the global stage. The power to deter is also the power to destroy, and how the United States balances this dichotomy will define the future of international relations for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a world that seems to be on a perpetual edge of conflict, the Pentagon’s recent announcement about developing a new variant of the gravity bomb, the B61-13, sends a shiver down the spine of those who value peace and stability.

Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to endorse former President Donald Trump at a pivotal rally in Florida. This strategic move by Sanders aligns one of the GOP’s rising stars with Trump, who remains a dominant figure in Republican politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanders, known for her straight-shooting style as Trump’s White House press secretary, has been a key player in the conservative movement since her tenure in the White House. Her endorsement comes as Trump opts to hold a rally in Florida simultaneously with the third GOP presidential primary debate in Miami, sending a clear signal of his influence and drawing attention away from the debate stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This endorsement is not just a boon for Trump; it also solidifies Sanders’ position within the Republican hierarchy. Her decision to back Trump before a single primary vote is cast illustrates the political calculus in the GOP, where Trump’s endorsement has proven to be gold dust in Republican primaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanders’ support could be seen as a snub to other high-profile Republican contenders like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as a potential challenger to Trump. DeSantis, despite not having formally announced a presidential bid, has been garnering significant endorsements, including that of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. The tussle for endorsements highlights the strategic battleground for the hearts and minds of Republican voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of Sanders’ endorsement also speaks volumes. Having remained neutral in the early stages of the primary race, her support for Trump at this juncture suggests a tactical play to consolidate the conservative base. Her rhetoric, sharply critical of President Biden’s policies, echoes the sentiment of a significant portion of the GOP base that yearns for a return to Trump-era policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, on his part, has welcomed Sanders’ endorsement, emphasizing their past success in the White House and expressing enthusiasm for her presence at the Florida rally. As Trump’s former press secretary, Sanders’ voice carries weight, and her decision to publicly back Trump solidifies her stance within the party’s pro-Trump faction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For conservative voters, Sanders’ endorsement reinforces the narrative of a “normal versus crazy” political landscape, a line often used to contrast Republican policies with those of the Democrats under Biden’s leadership. As the GOP navigates this divisive time, endorsements from prominent figures like Sanders will likely play a significant role in shaping the party’s future and the outcome of the 2024 presidential nomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days to come, the spotlight will be on Sanders as she takes the stage in Florida, marking a defining moment in the 2024 race. Her backing of Trump sends a clear message to the Republican base and her political adversaries alike: the road to the GOP nomination still runs through Trump’s corner, with Sanders now firmly alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the 2024 presidential race heats up, a high-profile endorsement is making waves across the nation.
