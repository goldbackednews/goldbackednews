A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump Defends Free Speech - A Struggle Against DOJ’s Attempted Gag Order</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/26/Defending-Free-Speech/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump Defends Free Speech - A Struggle Against DOJ’s Attempted Gag Order" /><published>2023-09-26T16:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-26T16:42:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/26/Defending-Free-Speech</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/26/Defending-Free-Speech/">&lt;p&gt;In the latest saga of political and legal tumult, Former President Donald Trump is standing resolute against a gag order requested by the Department of Justice (DOJ). His legal representatives have drafted a comprehensive 25-page brief opposing the DOJ’s attempt to muzzle Trump’s voice, citing violations of free speech and the need for governmental transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fighting-for-the-first-amendment&quot;&gt;Fighting for the First Amendment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s legal team is fervently contesting the proposed gag order, claiming it to be a direct infringement upon his First Amendment rights. In a political climate where scrutiny and criticism of governmental action are paramount, they argue that suppressing Trump’s perspectives is a blatant attempt to obstruct public critique of the prosecution’s conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal proceedings are unveiling amidst a series of efforts to diminish Trump’s outspokenness. Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team have expressed concerns over Trump’s inflammatory and confrontational language, suggesting it could potentially influence jurors’ opinions and compromise the integrity of legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argue that Trump’s aggressive remarks not only intimidate individuals and institutions but also encourage acts of threats and harassment against the entities he criticizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He inspires others to perpetrate threats and harassment against his targets,” prosecutors declare, outlining the detrimental consequences of Trump’s rhetorical aggressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is also combating initiatives by certain Democrats to prohibit his presence on the 2024 presidential primary ballots, leveraging the protective provisions of the U.S. Constitution as his safeguard. Several states are concurrently striving to exclude his candidacy owing to his purported role in the Capitol incidents on January 6, 2021, perceived by opponents as a rebellion against the nation. His lawyers are steadfast in their stance that Trump’s commentary regarding the 2020 elections is constitutionally protected, refuting any insinuations of his involvement in the alleged insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

The move is seen as an attempt to catch up with Trump, who had already announced his plans to support the striking workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biden-in-the-shadow-of-trump&quot;&gt;Biden in the Shadow of Trump?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rendezvous with striking workers unfolds amidst high inflation and substantial government subsidies on electric vehicles—hallmarks of “Bidenomics.” Biden’s unexpected decision to stand with UAW members and address them through a bullhorn reflects a gesture not recalled in U.S. labor history from a sitting president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Biden’s move to support striking workers directly is unprecedented, suggesting a tactical maneuver to counter Trump’s strong foothold among blue-collar workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-timeline-of-reactions&quot;&gt;A Timeline of Reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of events is intriguing. Trump announced on September 18 that he would be visiting striking workers in Detroit on September 27, opting to support them over attending the second Republican presidential primary debate. The announcement seemed to send shockwaves through the Democratic ranks, stirring a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days after Trump’s announcement, Biden declared he would be visiting UAW workers, and his visit conveniently occurred a day before Trump’s planned appearance. This sequence of actions raises eyebrows, hinting at a reactive stance from Biden, seemingly following Trump’s lead in an attempt to secure support from the labor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-historical-context&quot;&gt;The Historical Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, sitting presidents have steered clear of direct involvement in strikes, opting to maintain a balance between the rights of workers and the broader economic implications of labor disruptions. Even ardent pro-union presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman did not join ongoing strikes. Biden’s recent actions, therefore, mark a significant departure from historical precedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Biden’s boldness in supporting the UAW strike is reminiscent of the support President-elect Barack Obama showed for an illegal strike by workers at a window factory before he assumed office in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;political-implications&quot;&gt;Political Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s alignment with the UAW strike, especially in the wake of Trump’s announcement, seems to paint a picture of a presidency trying to keep pace, responding to the movements of its predecessor. The mirroring of actions emphasizes the political tussle between the two figures, with each seeking to solidify their standing with workers and the broader electorate. The question that lingers is whether Biden’s attempt to align himself with laborers is a genuine gesture of solidarity or a calculated political move to regain the limelight stolen by Trump’s proactive stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a climate rife with political maneuvering, Biden’s step to join the UAW picket line underscores the ongoing duel for influence between him and Trump. The unfolding events present a tableau of a presidency in response mode, reacting to the strategies laid down by Trump.

Davis is accused of having his ex-girlfriend forcibly committed to a mental health program, leveraging his position and the cooperation of unsuspecting colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abuse-of-power&quot;&gt;Abuse of Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis, despite being married with children, allegedly utilized his role to detain his former partner, causing her to endure several days in a medical facility. The accusations suggest a deeply troubling abuse of power, with Davis allegedly threatening to misrepresent his ex-girlfriend’s mental state, asserting, “I know you’re not crazy; I’ll portray you as such.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-calculated-move&quot;&gt;A Calculated Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case documents illustrate a premeditated effort by Davis on August 21. Enlisting the assistance of fellow officers, he initiated a scheme, claiming his ex-girlfriend, identified as M.F., was struggling with mental health issues. Davis, while off-duty, utilized official channels, leveraging his role as a trooper to gain an order to have her committed, based on purported suicidal messages from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hunt-and-confrontation&quot;&gt;The Hunt and Confrontation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon securing the order, Davis, with a civilian companion, located M.F. in a state forest. A confrontation ensued, captured on video by the accompanying civilian and later released by the DA’s office, revealing Davis physically restraining his ex-girlfriend on the ground. Subsequently, uniformed officers transported the visibly confused and uninformed M.F. to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Schuylkill, where she remained in involuntary commitment for five days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clearing-the-air&quot;&gt;Clearing the Air&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged victim showcased no signs of suicidal intentions during her unwarranted commitment. Post-release interviews and evaluations of message exchanges between the involved parties disclosed no credible evidence warranting her enforced treatment. The messages presented by Davis to substantiate his claims were deemed hypothetical and part of a broader relational dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facing-the-law&quot;&gt;Facing the Law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis now faces a slew of serious charges, including felony strangulation, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and official oppression, highlighting the severe consequences of alleged misdeeds under the guise of authority.&lt;/p&gt;

Her remarks put her in stark contrast with the prevailing narrative and raise questions about the unity and messaging of the Democratic Party on the state of the nation’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aocs-economic-crisis-claims&quot;&gt;AOC’s Economic Crisis Claims&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to union workers, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that the U.S. is facing a “special kind of crisis” in terms of its economy. Without explicitly mentioning names or political parties, she criticized Washington elites and Wall Street analysts for their alleged detachment from the everyday economic struggles of average citizens, portraying them as experiencing the economy “on paper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Now if you ask a Washington insider or a Wall Street analyst, they will tell you, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ They’ll say, ‘Look at GDP. Look at the growth rate.’ They’ll say, ‘Look at job numbers. How are we in a crisis?’” - AOC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocasio-Cortez contended that such elites cannot fathom the tough economic choices that many Americans grapple with daily, such as choosing between paying for childcare or work, and medicine or rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clashing-narratives&quot;&gt;Clashing Narratives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden has been vocal about the successes of his economic plans, coining the term “Bidenomics” on the campaign trail. He cites the creation of over 13 million jobs and sustained periods of low unemployment under his administration as indicators of a flourishing economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve had 19 straight months of unemployment under 4% for the first time in American history. We have the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world, with core inflation rate the last three months at 2.4%.” - President Biden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-perception-gap&quot;&gt;The Perception Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the perception of the economy amongst Americans seems to be at odds with Biden’s assertions. A recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll suggests that nearly three quarters of Americans harbor negative attitudes toward the state of the economy, with 91% of respondents expressing discontent with food prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clash between the experienced realities of citizens and the proclaimed economic successes of the administration illuminates a disconnect, potentially impacting public trust and the upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussions around economic health continue to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the divergent narratives presented by Representative Ocasio-Cortez and President Biden will find a reconciling middle ground or whether this dissonance will echo louder in the political chambers, creating ripples in the electorate’s perceptions and decisions in the upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, painted a dire picture of the U.S. economy during her speech to union workers in Wentzville, Missouri, a stance that seems to directly contradict President Joe Biden’s upbeat economic narrative, a cornerstone of his re-election campaign. Her remarks put her in stark contrast with the prevailing narrative and raise questions about the unity and messaging of the Democratic Party on the state of the nation’s economy. AOC’s Economic Crisis Claims Speaking to union workers, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that the U.S. is facing a “special kind of crisis” in terms of its economy. Without explicitly mentioning names or political parties, she criticized Washington elites and Wall Street analysts for their alleged detachment from the everyday economic struggles of average citizens, portraying them as experiencing the economy “on paper.” “Now if you ask a Washington insider or a Wall Street analyst, they will tell you, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ They’ll say, ‘Look at GDP. Look at the growth rate.’ They’ll say, ‘Look at job numbers. How are we in a crisis?’” - AOC Ocasio-Cortez contended that such elites cannot fathom the tough economic choices that many Americans grapple with daily, such as choosing between paying for childcare or work, and medicine or rent. Clashing Narratives President Biden has been vocal about the successes of his economic plans, coining the term “Bidenomics” on the campaign trail. He cites the creation of over 13 million jobs and sustained periods of low unemployment under his administration as indicators of a flourishing economy. “We’ve had 19 straight months of unemployment under 4% for the first time in American history. We have the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world, with core inflation rate the last three months at 2.4%.” - President Biden The Perception Gap However, the perception of the economy amongst Americans seems to be at odds with Biden’s assertions. A recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll suggests that nearly three quarters of Americans harbor negative attitudes toward the state of the economy, with 91% of respondents expressing discontent with food prices.

Award-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio finds himself in the spotlight, not for his stellar performances, but for alleged clandestine funding of lawsuits against major oil companies through his environmental fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotlight-on-funding&quot;&gt;Spotlight on Funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Republican lawmakers, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), have raised questions regarding the source of funding for a series of lawsuits brought by the California law firm, Sher Edling. These lawsuits aim to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their alleged misinformation campaigns around climate change and the environmental impact of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dicaprios-alleged-role&quot;&gt;DiCaprio’s Alleged Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern centers around DiCaprio purportedly channeling money into these lawsuits through environmental funds, specifically the Resources Legacy Fund and New Venture Fund, accused of being vessels for ‘dark money’ from wealthy liberals, aimed at advancing climate change litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the lawmakers, these funds “manage the funds of affluent elitists like Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio.” It’s alleged that these groups, in turn, have provided millions to Sher Edling to fuel numerous climate change lawsuits against oil companies, aiming to eradicate fossil fuels—a goal perceived to lack majority support in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-grand-objective&quot;&gt;The Grand Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law firm’s endeavors are being seen by the lawmakers as part of a larger strategy to “kill fossil fuels” through litigation, supposedly propelled by wealthy liberals, like DiCaprio, via tax-free, dark money pass-through funds. These funds, allegedly, are contributing to Sher Edling’s pursuit to bring accountability to the fossil fuel industry for their purported deceptive practices around climate change science and the environmental repercussions of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;echoes-of-a-past-report&quot;&gt;Echoes of a Past Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time DiCaprio’s environmental endeavors have raised eyebrows. Allegations against him are reminiscent of a Fox News report from the previous year, claiming that the actor’s non-profit foundation awarded grants to a ‘dark money’ initiative, which subsequently funneled money to Sher Edling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clashing-interests-and-ideals&quot;&gt;Clashing Interests and Ideals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the law firm continues its legal pursuits against big oil companies, the spotlight on DiCaprio brings forth questions about the intersection of celebrity activism, political interests, and environmental conservation. It highlights the ongoing tensions between those advocating for stricter environmental safeguards and stakeholders in the fossil fuel industry. As these events unfold, the debate intensifies, showcasing the complex, multifaceted battle for the planet’s future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In the bustling world of Hollywood glitz and glam, it’s not unusual for celebrities to be embroiled in controversies that extend beyond the silver screen.

This confrontation brings a rarely explored constitutional clause to the forefront, potentially reshaping the interpretation of constitutional rights and presidential candidacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-controversial-clause&quot;&gt;A Controversial Clause&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges Trump faces are under a Civil War-era clause in the 14th Amendment, a part of the Constitution ratified in 1868, three years post-Civil War. The clause, which has been seldom invoked, was initially intended to prevent former Confederate officials from securing governmental positions. It disqualifies anyone who has sworn to uphold the Constitution but later engaged in insurrection or rebellion against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-defense&quot;&gt;Trump’s Defense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s lawyers contend that the aforementioned clause shouldn’t apply to him as he hasn’t “engaged in insurrection or rebellion,” but instead has only ‘instigated’ action. They argue that Trump’s actions leading up to the notorious Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, and his efforts to contest the 2020 election results are protected under the freedom of speech, granted by the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s legal team emphasizes that he is being harassed for behavior protected by the First Amendment under Colorado’s anti-SLAPP law, a statute designed to deter lawsuits that intend to silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legal-battle-in-the-spotlight&quot;&gt;Legal Battle in the Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case is the first of its kind to be considered in open court, highlighting constitutional disputes and providing a platform for exploring the relationship between freedom of speech and constitutional clauses designed to protect the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge is significant as it is backed by an organization with substantial legal resources, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal group. Another liberal group, Free Speech For The People, has followed suit, filing a challenge in Minnesota, scheduled for hearing on Nov. 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ongoing cases spotlight an intersection between constitutional protections and their applicability to actions perceived as rebellious against the Constitution. The resolution of these cases could set a significant legal precedent, determining the limitations of constitutional rights in the context of preserving democratic principles and the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Denver District Judge Sarah B. Wallace schedules hearings, and with the probability of the issue reaching the U.S. Supreme Court—which has never heard a case on this provision of the 14th Amendment—the legal and political communities are eagerly awaiting the outcomes, which might just redefine constitutional interpretations for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump is locked in a legal battle as his attorneys argue that attempts to bar him from the 2024 ballot, citing a rare “insurrection” clause from the Constitution, infringe upon his freedom of speech rights under the First Amendment.

&lt;p&gt;The charges against Menendez allege that from 2018 to 2022, he and his wife engaged in corrupt relationships with three New Jersey businessmen. It is claimed that the couple accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for Menendez using his power and influence as a senator to protect and enrich the involved businessmen and to benefit the Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
