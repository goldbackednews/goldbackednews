A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Disney’s Woke Dive - A MAGA Warning for Corporations?</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/09/Disney-Woke-Downturn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Disney’s Woke Dive - A MAGA Warning for Corporations?" /><published>2023-09-09T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-09T11:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/09/Disney-Woke-Downturn</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/09/Disney-Woke-Downturn/">&lt;p&gt;Disney, a name that once stood for family-friendly content and a whole lot of magic, seems to be facing its own kind of enchantment gone wrong. In the last year alone, their stock has taken a nosedive, dropping by a whopping 27 percent. And if we turn back the pages to the days before the pandemic, Disney shares are down an astonishing 60.1 percent since their March 2021 high. What’s behind this free fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many factors can be attributed to a company’s decline, there’s a growing sentiment, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Disney’s evident “woke” approach is driving away its core audience. Being “woke,” in other words, pushing for a more politically correct and inclusive narrative, might sound noble to some. But is it commercially viable for a company that has historically thrived on traditional values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney’s decision to champion the radical LGBTQ agenda is a case in point. They haven’t just integrated this into their entertainment content but have also been vocal about it in the political sphere. Their feud with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis (R), over this issue is testimony to their unabashed political stand. While the debate on LGBTQ rights is a broader one, should a children’s entertainment company be the one leading the charge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another red flag has been the allegations and lawsuits against Disney. They stand accused of misleading investors about Disney+’s financial health. For a company that’s been a household name, such claims do a number on investor trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the woke politics. The shift to streaming, which most saw as the next frontier for entertainment, has also not panned out for Disney as they’d hoped. They’ve invested heavily, but with a string of box-office flops and consistent streaming losses, it’s clear that they might have missed the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Bob Iger’s apparent plans to offload many of Disney’s TV properties further show the turmoil within. With traditional cable TV no longer as profitable, thanks to many opting out, the company seems to be in a mad scramble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the MAGA folks, this could be a warning bell for other corporations. The message? Stick to what you’re good at and be wary of adopting every trending political agenda. After all, as Disney’s tumble shows, even giants can falter when they lose sight of their core audience and values.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Disney, a name that once stood for family-friendly content and a whole lot of magic, seems to be facing its own kind of enchantment gone wrong.

&lt;p&gt;Passengers aboard an American Airlines flight were left in shock and disbelief when a hidden camera was allegedly discovered in the plane’s bathroom. The incident, which is now under investigation by the FBI, further adds to the growing concerns surrounding privacy and safety in air travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details of the Disturbing Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 2nd, an American Airlines flight, originating from Charlotte, N.C., landed at Boston Logan International Airport where a series of peculiar events unraveled. Massachusetts state police confirmed that a “potential criminal act” had taken place during the flight. Without divulging intricate details, the authorities mentioned the involvement of a “juvenile, a flight attendant, and a cell phone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the incident itself occurred in mid-air, the jurisdiction falls under federal law due to the nature of the crime and the location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Passenger’s Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interaction with Fox affiliate Boston 25, a passenger on the ill-fated flight recounted a peculiar interaction between a teenage girl and a male flight attendant. The girl, intending to use the first-class section restroom, was momentarily halted by the attendant, who proceeded to enter the restroom under the pretext of washing his hands. Once he exited, the girl accessed the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickened when the girl’s mother, upon discovering something amiss in the bathroom, halted another passenger from entering. She shared the unsettling information that a camera had been placed inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culmination and Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the plane’s landing, the situation escalated when law enforcement boarded the flight. After a thorough check of the restroom by multiple individuals, the male flight attendant, previously involved in the earlier interaction, was escorted off the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airline industry, which has been striving to rebuild trust and ensure safety post the pandemic, now has another challenge on its hands – ensuring the privacy of its passengers. As the FBI digs deeper into the investigation, passengers and the public eagerly await more information on this alarming breach of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A Flight to Remember for All the Wrong Reasons Passengers aboard an American Airlines flight were left in shock and disbelief when a hidden camera was allegedly discovered in the plane’s bathroom.

The United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in its groundbreaking decision, has implied that President Biden and his team might have dangerously trampled upon the sacred First Amendment rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about governance; it’s about the very essence of our democracy. The court has pointed out how key figures in the administration, including those at the very top in the White House, the Surgeon General’s office, CDC, and even the FBI, seem to have used their positions to unduly and coercively influence online content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel didn’t mince words: “We find that the White House, acting in concert with the Surgeon General’s office, likely coerced the platforms to make their moderation decisions … and significantly encouraged the platforms’ decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI, long considered an impartial agency, was also not spared. The panel suggested that the FBI went far beyond its mandate, not only influencing platforms but also proactively inducing changes to moderation policies. Actions that, many argue, reek of constitutional infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the original lower court injunction was wide in its scope, the revised order now specifically targets and holds accountable these entities: the White House, Surgeon General’s office, CDC, and FBI. It’s a move that many see as the Fifth Circuit stepping up to defend the Constitution from executive overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Eric Schmitt didn’t hold back in his response, labeling the decision a “massive victory for free speech.” In a rallying cry to all freedom-loving Americans, he emphasized, “Because of Missouri v. Biden, the federal government is prohibited yet again from colluding with social media giants to censor freedom of speech online.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Biden administration scrambles to respond, their attempt at defense seems weak at best. While they review the decision and weigh their options, one thing is clear: the American people are watching. With the potential for this case to be elevated to the Supreme Court, it serves as a grim reminder of the need for vigilance in defending our freedoms against potential governmental overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting Teddy Roosevelt’s renowned “Citizenship in a Republic” speech, Noem said, “It is my honor to present to you the man in the arena. He is a man of significance. He is the leader, the fighter that our country needs. He has my full and complete endorsement for president of the United States of America. I will do everything I can to help him win and save this country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation had been rife leading up to the rally about Noem’s endorsement and Trump’s appearance, with many considering Noem as a possible vice-presidential candidate if Trump secures the nomination. Addressing the rally, Noem acknowledged the buzz, revealing that she had been inundated with queries about the night’s event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the dedication of the former President, Noem described how, while many other presidential hopefuls declined invitations to attend the rally, Trump immediately pledged his attendance. She praised Trump’s dedication to Americans, stressing that “he shows up for every American and fights for us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the critical issues Noem brought to the forefront was the situation at the U.S. Southern border. She praised Trump’s actions during his term, emphasizing his strategy of “peace through strength” and portraying him as the only trustworthy candidate concerning these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks prepared for the event, the former President expressed his gratitude towards Noem, calling her “one of the most successful governors in the entire nation.” Trump lauded Noem’s stance on American values and her tough position on China, while also highlighting her decision to keep South Dakota open during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this significant endorsement, Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidential race gains even more momentum, backed by a prominent Republican figure.

&lt;p&gt;Texas Governor Greg Abbott faces unwarranted criticism from New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the Lone Star State’s “Operation Lone Star” initiative. Mayor Adams might be looking for a scapegoat, but the numbers and facts reveal a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending “Operation Lone Star”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star” is a proactive measure to ensure border security. A component of this mission is the busing of migrants to sanctuary cities, ensuring an equitable distribution and relief for overwhelmed border towns. Contrary to Mayor Adams’ portrayal, this initiative was designed with community welfare in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a September 6 town hall meeting, Mayor Adams seemed to pass the buck onto Texas, exclaiming, “It started with a madman down in Texas [who] decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.” However, his emotional remarks paint a misleading picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving Deep into the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Adams bemoans the impact on New York City, he conveniently omits the broader context. Governor Abbott was quick to point out that Texas had bused only 13,300 migrants to New York. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers brought in by federal initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbott’s press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, shed light on this selective narrative. “Mayor Adams was proud of his sanctuary city status until Texas began busing migrants to New York City,” Mahaleris highlighted, emphasizing the hypocrisy of such a stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Mahaleris urged Mayor Adams to consider the bigger picture, suggesting he address concerns to President Biden’s administration. The federal government, under Biden, has been “flying planeloads of migrants all around the country, straining state and local resources,” Mahaleris noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Finger-Pointing: The True Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mayor Adams seems occupied with shifting blame, Governor Abbott remains focused on the core issue at hand: the safety, security, and welfare of communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mayor Adams’s alarmist remarks cannot be ignored entirely. The influx from various parts of the world, the looming fiscal challenges, and the broader implications for the nation’s socio-economic fabric demand attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains evident is that the challenge is a national one and not a creation of any single state’s policies. While the debate between NYC and Texas heats up, one can hope that the focus will shift from blame games to constructive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Governor Greg Abbott Stands Tall Against Unfair Accusations Texas Governor Greg Abbott faces unwarranted criticism from New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the Lone Star State’s “Operation Lone Star” initiative. Mayor Adams might be looking for a scapegoat, but the numbers and facts reveal a different story. Defending “Operation Lone Star” Governor Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star” is a proactive measure to ensure border security. A component of this mission is the busing of migrants to sanctuary cities, ensuring an equitable distribution and relief for overwhelmed border towns. Contrary to Mayor Adams’ portrayal, this initiative was designed with community welfare in mind. During a September 6 town hall meeting, Mayor Adams seemed to pass the buck onto Texas, exclaiming, “It started with a madman down in Texas [who] decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.” However, his emotional remarks paint a misleading picture. Diving Deep into the Numbers While Adams bemoans the impact on New York City, he conveniently omits the broader context. Governor Abbott was quick to point out that Texas had bused only 13,300 migrants to New York. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers brought in by federal initiatives. Abbott’s press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, shed light on this selective narrative. “Mayor Adams was proud of his sanctuary city status until Texas began busing migrants to New York City,” Mahaleris highlighted, emphasizing the hypocrisy of such a stance. Furthermore, Mahaleris urged Mayor Adams to consider the bigger picture, suggesting he address concerns to President Biden’s administration. The federal government, under Biden, has been “flying planeloads of migrants all around the country, straining state and local resources,” Mahaleris noted.

During a candid interview with Newsmax’s “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Pence declared that the value of life is paramount, even more so than winning an election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a charged political environment where political calculations often override principles, Pence’s bold proclamation stands out. Challenging a common belief, Pence dismissed the notion, earlier suggested by former President Trump, that their administration lost midterm elections because of overturning Roe v. Wade. “I don’t believe that for a second,” Pence responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just politics, Pence views the right to life as a deep moral conviction. He expressed concerns about some wanting to reduce the life issue to a state-level matter. “For me, right to life’s not a state issue, it’s a moral issue. I’ll be a champion for right to life in the Oval Office,” he passionately conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence’s words weren’t solely about unborn children but extended to women in distressing situations as well. His remarks highlight the compassion underlying the pro-life stance: “I think when you stand on the right to life, you stand with principle and compassion and demonstrate not just a willingness to put our arms around the unborn but around newborns and women in crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels with international sentiment, Pence highlighted that most European nations have restrictions on abortion after the unborn child can feel pain. This aligns with the beliefs of a vast majority of Americans, with 70% sharing this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the GOP primary is unfolding with various stances and policies, Pence wants to be recognized for his unwavering conservative approach. He refrained from diving deep into the populist policies of Trump, only emphasizing that their administration had always governed with conservative principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence’s interview underscores his dedication to the pro-life movement. As the political sphere evolves with various narratives, Pence’s commitment to life, compassion, and moral values remains unshaken.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former Vice President Mike Pence has resoundingly affirmed his unwavering commitment to the pro-life cause, emphasizing that the right to life holds more weight than political gamesmanship.

&lt;p&gt;In a move that sets the city apart from the rest of the state, the City of Huntington Beach, California, made a crucial decision on Wednesday: it will not impose universal mask and vaccine mandates for COVID-19. This move highlights the ever-growing divide between the freedom-centric localities and the broader state measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Victory for Personal Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motion to ban the mandates, brought forward by Mayor Pro Tem Gracey Van Der Mark, emphasizes the importance of individual liberties. Van Der Mark critiqued past mask mandates, declaring that they “unnecessarily limited the freedoms of the citizens of Huntington Beach.” In a society where autonomy should be celebrated, these measures were seen as restrictive, especially for individuals who had no exposure or risk associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the decision was not taken lightly. With a narrow 4-3 vote, the City Council showcased the weight of the debate, highlighting that while there is support for personal freedom, there are voices of caution as well. However, the motion’s successful passing signifies that, at least in Huntington Beach, the voice of liberty rings louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Response to a Slight Rise in Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the decision comes amidst a slight increase in COVID cases within the city, it stands as a testament to the city’s commitment to maintaining the rights of its citizens. The current uptick does not appear to have deterred the local government’s determination to prioritize choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntington Beach - A History of Defiance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huntington Beach’s move isn’t surprising for those familiar with its history. Located a mere hour from Los Angeles, the city has been a beacon of resistance against statewide mask mandates throughout the pandemic’s duration. In stark contrast to California’s rigid approach, Huntington Beach opts for personal choice and autonomy, reflecting its longstanding conservative roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Larger Trend or a Lone Rebellion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether other cities will follow Huntington Beach’s footsteps remains to be seen. However, the city’s latest decision cements its reputation as a bastion for conservatives and those valuing personal freedoms over sweeping state directives. As the debate surrounding COVID measures continues to polarize the nation, Huntington Beach stands as a reminder that there’s more than one way to address the challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Defying Statewide Draconian Measures, Huntington Beach Makes A Stand In a move that sets the city apart from the rest of the state, the City of Huntington Beach, California, made a crucial decision on Wednesday: it will not impose universal mask and vaccine mandates for COVID-19.

&lt;p&gt;While the world was preoccupied with the spectacle of former President Donald Trump’s voluntary surrender at Fulton County Jail, a grave and haunting pattern of inmate deaths emerged in the shadows of the facility. Six fatalities have been reported since the end of July, intensifying concerns over the jail’s operations and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presidential Surrender Overshadows a Dire Situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jail gained immense attention when Trump turned himself in due to charges stemming from alleged election interference in Georgia. The media fervently covered his booking and that of his 18 co-defendants. However, beneath this high-profile event, the stark reality of life in the jail came into focus with the tragic death of 24-year-old Shawndre Delmore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOJ’s Intervention: A Damning Indictment of Jail Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disturbing incidents, such as the death of 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson caused by apparent severe neglect, have painted a bleak picture of the facility’s conditions. This alarming environment prompted the Department of Justice (DOJ) to launch a civil investigation, addressing growing concerns over violence, deplorable living conditions, and even reports of an inmate’s body found with insect infestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Series of Troubling Deaths within Jail Walls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Delmore, several inmates have met untimely deaths within the prison’s confines in recent weeks. Samuel Lawrence, Dayvion Blake, Alexander Hawkins, Christopher Smith, and Montay Stinson all faced tragic ends, with Blake’s fatal stabbing further emphasizing the urgent need for reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: The Need for Transparency and Reform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a series of tragedies unfolding at Fulton County Jail, it’s paramount that the facility undergoes scrutiny and reforms to prevent further loss of life. While the spotlight may have been on Trump’s booking, the focus should now shift towards ensuring the safety and well-being of the inmates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Fulton County Jail: A Ground Zero for Presidential Controversies and Grim Realities While the world was preoccupied with the spectacle of former President Donald Trump’s voluntary surrender at Fulton County Jail, a grave and haunting pattern of inmate deaths emerged in the shadows of the facility.
