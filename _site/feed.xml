A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Veil of Silence - Dems Accused of Shielding Damaging Biden Evidence</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/01/Dems-Biden-Evidence-Controversy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Veil of Silence - Dems Accused of Shielding Damaging Biden Evidence" /><published>2023-10-01T09:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T09:05:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/01/Dems-Biden-Evidence-Controversy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/01/Dems-Biden-Evidence-Controversy/">&lt;p&gt;Texas Representative Beth Van Duyne has come forward with stern accusations against the Democrat Party, asserting that they are deliberately deflecting and suppressing substantial evidence in the impeachment inquiry involving President Joe Biden. Her claim implies a significant level of concern within the party, fearing the repercussions that may ensue should the details come to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dodging-accountability&quot;&gt;Dodging Accountability?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne’s bold accusations suggest that the Democrats are afraid and attempting to “poo-poo” substantial evidence to keep it away from the public eye. “The last thing they want is this information out there,” she mentioned during her appearance on “Saturday Agenda,” implicating a deliberate attempt to hinder transparency and avoid potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unveiling-the-alleged-chain-of-events&quot;&gt;Unveiling the Alleged Chain of Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne referenced the release of about “700 pages” of documents by the House Ways and Means Committee last week related to the inquiry. According to her, the documents portray a clear narrative where Hunter Biden would acquire foreign clients who, upon facing trouble, would be assisted by his father, Joe Biden, during his tenure as vice president. This alleged intervention would subsequently result in millions flowing into Hunter Biden’s accounts and the companies he’s associated with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raising-critical-questions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising Critical Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This purported chain of actions has sparked a series of critical questions, with Van Duyne emphasizing the necessity to determine how much of the acquired money was used to settle bills for Joe Biden and to what extent he was actively involved in manipulating U.S. policies to accommodate requests from these foreign entities. “Not only did he have dinner with these people, but he actually manipulated US policy to be able to fulfill their requests,” Van Duyne alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;highlighting-the-importance-of-inquiry&quot;&gt;Highlighting the Importance of Inquiry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne stressed the importance of the ongoing inquiry, declaring that unveiling the truth is pivotal to holding the involved parties accountable. She argued that the inquiry is essential to determine whether Joe Biden had indeed leveraged his position to manipulate U.S. policy and fulfill requests from foreign clients associated with his son, thus raising serious concerns over the integrity of his actions while in office.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this a case of progressive evolution, or is it eroding the traditional foundations and unity of the naval forces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;woke-tides---a-naval-transformation&quot;&gt;‘Woke’ Tides - A Naval Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy has adopted a so-called “inclusive” approach, encouraging sailors to use gender pronouns during introductions. Detailed in their “Trans and Non-Binary Awareness” guide, the policy seeks to embrace the various expressions of gender identity including “pangender,” “gender neutral,” and “two-spirit.” While promoted under the banner of inclusivity and respect, some view it as an imposition of “woke” ideology, questioning its impact on the naval ethos and operational cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wokeness-dilemma---progress-or-decay&quot;&gt;The ‘Wokeness’ Dilemma - Progress or Decay?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of such “woke” policies raises essential questions about the true nature of progress. Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, expressed concerns about potential divisions, questioning whether such policies might compromise the cohesion and combative efficacy of the Navy. Is the Royal Navy being steered by the currents of political correctness, possibly at the expense of its core values and duties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideological-currents---beyond-gender&quot;&gt;Ideological Currents - Beyond Gender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “wokeness” doesn’t stop at gender pronouns. The Royal Navy is also propagating contentious concepts such as “white privilege” and “intersectionality,” focusing on societal aspects of an individual’s identity like race, class, and gender, and their interconnected impacts on discrimination and privilege. While the intent might be to foster equality and mutual respect, the implementation of such ideologically charged concepts can be seen as polarizing and detrimental to unit harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;operational-integrity---balancing-act&quot;&gt;Operational Integrity - Balancing Act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of such radical policies, maintaining operational integrity while promoting diversity seems like a tightrope walk. The implementation of these “woke” guidelines is critical to understanding the deeper implications on organizational unity and the morale of the personnel. Are these policies truly fostering respect and understanding, or are they sowing seeds of discord among the naval ranks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defence-and-wokeness---a-mismatched-alliance&quot;&gt;Defence and ‘Wokeness’ - A Mismatched Alliance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence insists that the Royal Navy’s chief concern is to safeguard the UK and its interests. However, the introduction of such ideological guidelines seems to blur the line between maintaining operational readiness and pursuing societal progressivism. Is ‘wokeness’ overshadowing the Navy’s fundamental duties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigating-the-woke-seas---the-way-forward&quot;&gt;Navigating the ‘Woke’ Seas - The Way Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Royal Navy’s pursuit of “wokeness” highlights the ongoing societal struggle between traditional values and progressive ideals. It’s crucial to debate whether such ideological shifts are genuinely conducive to fostering inclusivity and respect or if they are simply a navigation through uncharted, and potentially perilous, ideological waters, threatening the very essence of naval traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a pursuit of “wokeness,” the Royal Navy’s recent push for sailors to introduce themselves with gender pronouns is sparking quite a debate.

Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), pulling a fire alarm in the congressional office building, has left many skeptical and critical of his reasoning and intentions. This peculiar incident has thrown Bowman into a whirlwind of controversy and speculation, igniting debates over the integrity and judgment of the legislator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ripples-of-doubt-and-speculation&quot;&gt;Ripples of Doubt and Speculation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident, occurring in the highly secured Cannon Building, unfolded amidst the critical vote on the stopgap spending bill, crucial for averting a potential government shutdown. Such timing has intensified the doubts and led many to ponder over the possibility of a deliberate attempt to disrupt the ongoing legislative procedures. The severe reactions from his peers and the call for investigations by Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, underline the gravity of this seemingly reckless act and hint at deep-rooted implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bowmans-shaky-clarification&quot;&gt;Bowman’s Shaky Clarification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s attempt to clarify the situation did little to dispel the rising doubts and suspicions. His chief of staff, Sarah Iddrissu, expressed Bowman’s regret over any ensuing confusion, suggesting that it was a mere misunderstanding. “The Congressman did not realize he would trigger a building alarm… The Congressman regrets any confusion,” she tried to clarify. However, such an excuse seems rather thin, considering the sensitivity and the seriousness of the surroundings he operates in daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s own explanation did not fare much better, as he stated that he thought the alarm would open a door. “I didn’t mean to cause confusion… I didn’t know I was going to trip the whole building. I thought it would help me open the door,” he said to the reporters. This seemingly naïve justification, coming from a seasoned legislator, has only fueled further speculation regarding his real motives and raised questions about his competence and understanding of the protocols of the legislative building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;echoes-of-condemnation&quot;&gt;Echoes of Condemnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of Bowman’s act were quickly met with stern words and outright condemnation from his colleagues, like Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who termed the act as “potentially criminal” and “absolutely outrageous.” Lawler went a step further, suggesting that such shameful and unbecoming act demands Bowman’s resignation from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

Four human smugglers, associated with Mexico’s notorious Gulf Cartel, have pleaded guilty to causing fatal incidents in Texas, highlighting the perilous and often tragic journeys migrants undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-shadows--operations-unveiled&quot;&gt;Behind the Shadows – Operations Unveiled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Manuel Tena, Julia Isairis Torres, Israel Torres, and Jose Refugio Torres have admitted their guilt in two fatal smuggling attempts that resulted in the deaths of eight migrants. Tena, characterized as the mastermind behind these operations, has been actively recruiting individuals and coordinating smuggling efforts, profiting off the vulnerability of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scenes-of-despair--the-incidents&quot;&gt;Scenes of Despair – The Incidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smugglers were responsible for moving migrants from Rio Grande Valley to Houston in March 2019 when their vehicle overturned, killing four migrants and injuring several. Another tragedy struck in February 2022, when a boat transporting migrants from South Padre Island to Corpus Christi capsized near Port Mansfield, causing the death of four migrants and a smuggler, with two more severely injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guilt-and-consequence--verdicts-awaited&quot;&gt;Guilt and Consequence – Verdicts Awaited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involved individuals have pleaded guilty to several charges related to human smuggling conspiracies resulting in death. Tena will forfeit various properties in South Texas, procured through the profits of human smuggling. The three other accomplices, Julia, Israel, and Jose Torres, pleaded guilty to their involvement in the 2019 case. Meanwhile, two other suspects in the 2022 incident are still awaiting trial. The sentencing in December may see each accused facing a life term in prison for their appalling acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unseen-victims--the-human-cost&quot;&gt;Unseen Victims – The Human Cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ordeal reflects the enormous human cost related to illegal border crossings and human smuggling. The victims are often those desperate for a chance at a better life, only to find themselves entangled in a dangerous web of criminal operations. The impact of these incidents is vast, touching the lives of families who lose their loved ones and communities grappling with the consequences of such tragic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;international-spotlight--border-tensions&quot;&gt;International Spotlight – Border Tensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the U.S.-Mexico border constantly in international headlines due to the unprecedented number of illegal crossings, these incidents underscore the urgency of addressing the deeper issues at play. They point to a pressing need for comprehensive immigration reforms and enhanced border security measures to curb such calamities and ensure the safety and well-being of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acknowledgement of guilt by the cartel-connected smugglers sheds light on the dangerous, often deadly circumstances surrounding illegal border crossings. It’s a stark reminder of the human suffering and tragedy embedded in the pursuit of a better life and the profound need for transformative solutions to the longstanding issues at the border.

This extraordinary breach has provoked a strong reaction, with officials emphasizing the sanctity of taxpayer information and the necessity of stringent security protocols to avoid such disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leaking-the-secrets-of-the-rich&quot;&gt;Leaking the Secrets of the Rich&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn, 38, residing in Washington, D.C., is accused of disclosing tax returns of some of the wealthiest individuals in the nation, reaching thousands in number. These documents were relayed to various news media outlets and even reached ProPublica, laden with tax information related to a high-ranking government official. All this occurred while Littlejohn was operating as a government contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-charges-and-their-implications&quot;&gt;The Charges and Their Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn is facing a serious charge of unauthorized disclosure of tax returns and return information. If he’s convicted, he’s staring at a potential maximum penalty of a five-year prison term. These charges were brought forward as a criminal information instead of an indictment, implying the possibility of Littlejohn having entered a plea deal. This monumental breach has brought forth widespread criticism and a renewed focus on the criticality of safeguarding taxpayer information, a principle that is paramount in maintaining public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel refrained from commenting on the ongoing legal matter but was adamant about the unacceptability of any disclosure of taxpayer information. “The IRS has put in place new protocols and protections that tightened security,” he stressed, underlining the aggressive endeavors undertaken to safeguard tax and financial information of taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not only about the potential legal repercussions for the individuals involved but also about the grave breach of trust and the imperative need for robust, foolproof systems to maintain the sanctity of confidential information.

The RHSA brings forth the promise of a law that is both constitutional and democratic, establishing an interstate compact to create uniform rules governing medication control and racetrack safety in horse racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-closed-doors---hisas-unpopularity&quot;&gt;Behind Closed Doors - HISA’s Unpopularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act (HISA) is marred by secrecy and lack of consensus from the industry players. Its implementation, according to many, threatens to oust small businesses from the horseracing industry by burdening them with $66 million in regulatory costs. This act, despite its avowed goal to enact nationwide rules for racetrack safety and anti-doping, has met with substantial disapproval for its heavy-handed approach and alleged unconstitutionality, which is seen as giving federal power to a private entity without adequate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-rhsa---a-beacon-of-reform&quot;&gt;The Rise of RHSA - A Beacon of Reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to HISA’s perceived failures, Republican attorneys general have thrown their support behind the Racehorse Health and Safety Act (RHSA), proposed by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA). The RHSA promises to be more inclusive, allowing contributions from various industry entities, focusing on established scientific principles and methodologies. Advocates believe that this act will be significantly less costly as it plans to utilize existing state resources, enabling states to either enforce RHSO rules or allow RHSO to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-of-principles---science-vs-public-perception&quot;&gt;A Battle of Principles - Science vs Public Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical difference between HISA and RHSA lies in their foundational principles. The former is perceived to have rules grounded more in public perception, which failed to prevent numerous racehorse deaths at Churchill Downs, while the latter promises to base its rules on generally accepted scientific principles, focusing on the health and welfare of racehorses. The support for RHSA from entities like the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and the United States Trotting Association reinforces its commitment to sound veterinary science and industry inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to endorse RHSA by several state attorneys general reflects a broader push for reform in the horse racing industry, based on transparency, accountability, and scientific grounding. It promises to be a democratic and constitutional law that gives a voice to everyone in the industry and stands in stark contrast to HISA’s alleged clandestine development and unilateral imposition.

Kennedy Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate, is reportedly set to exit the Democratic primary to pursue a run for president as an Independent. This major political pivot is expected to be announced officially on October 9 in Pennsylvania. The revelation surfaces amidst speculations and concerns within the Democratic party about the potential ramifications of such a move, particularly regarding its impact on President Joe Biden’s voter base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kennedys-bold-move&quot;&gt;Kennedy’s Bold Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s reported departure from the Democrat primary has raised eyebrows and set the political sphere abuzz, considering the possible shifts in voter preferences and party allegiances this might induce. According to reports, Kennedy’s campaign will also launch attack ads against the Democrat National Committee (DNC) to smooth the transition for his announcement, highlighting the rising tensions within the party factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-clash-with-dnc&quot;&gt;The Clash with DNC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s planned independent run seems to emanate from his increasing disillusionment with the DNC, claiming that the committee is altering the rules to sideline his candidacy. Kennedy has been vocally critical of the DNC’s strategies and has accused them of blocking his participation in the political process, laying bare the internal conflicts and power struggles within the party. This assertion aligns with his public remarks made earlier this month, stressing his commitment to keeping all options open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-major-announcement&quot;&gt;The Major Announcement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s upcoming announcement in Philadelphia is expected to draw significant attention, given its potential implications on the political landscape. He has kept the details of the announcement under wraps but has assured that it will delineate his path to the White House and discuss avenues for national healing. Kennedy’s move to an independent candidacy is poised to challenge the established norms and rewrite the narratives of American politics, pointing towards an intensified battle for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-biden-and-the-democrats&quot;&gt;Impact on Biden and the Democrats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible defection of Kennedy to an independent run is causing unease among Democrat operatives, fearing that it would dilute Biden’s base by drawing votes away from him. Third Way cofounder Matt Bennett expressed concerns over third parties in close elections, emphasizing that they can be perilous and detrimental to the incumbent president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aligning-with-libertarians&quot;&gt;Aligning with Libertarians?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s political maneuvers have also been marked by his interactions with Libertarian Party chair Angela McArdle. Despite his declared commitment to running as a Democrat, he has identified with many libertarian viewpoints, revealing a convergence on various issues, including concerns about the “deep state.” This alignment opens the door to potential collaborations and support from varied political spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anticipated move to an independent run is a testament to the evolving and unpredictable nature of the current political terrain.
