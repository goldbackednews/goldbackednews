A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Mystery in South Carolina - Debris Discovered Following F-35 Jet’s Disappearance</title><link href="/news/2023/09/19/F35-Debris-Discovery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mystery in South Carolina - Debris Discovered Following F-35 Jet’s Disappearance" /><published>2023-09-19T11:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T11:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/19/F35-Debris-Discovery</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/19/F35-Debris-Discovery/">&lt;p&gt;South Carolina became the center of attention after a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II jet, a sophisticated stealth fighter, vanished from the radar. The disappearance of this state-of-the-art aircraft led to an immediate search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-puzzling-disappearance&quot;&gt;A Puzzling Disappearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon investigating the incident, military officials from Joint Base Charleston revealed a significant finding. A debris field was discovered in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. However, it’s still unconfirmed whether the debris belongs to the missing F-35 jet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the pilot, during an unspecified “mishap,” safely ejected from the jet on Sunday. Fortunately, after landing on the ground, the pilot received medical attention at a nearby center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the debris discovery, Joint Base Charleston made an announcement about a shift in responsibility. The United States Marine Corps will now take charge of the ongoing investigation into this incident. The primary objective? To understand the circumstances leading to the “mishap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the safety of the local community, officials urge residents to steer clear of the area where the debris was found. With the incident currently under active investigation, further details remain scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s concerning, however, is the Marine Corps’ decision to halt operations temporarily. This two-day break will focus on discussing “aviation safety matters and best practices.” This comes on the back of three Class-A aviation “mishaps” occurring in the last six weeks. The pause will allow Marines to reevaluate and ensure proper flight procedures, maintenance standards, and overall combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-time-of-reflection&quot;&gt;A Time of Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a press release, the Marine Corps explained the purpose of this operational pause. It serves to emphasize the importance of safety and operational standards, ensuring that pilots, crews, and aircraft maintain peak readiness. This measure aims to protect both the personnel and the public while preserving the Marine Corps’ status as a formidable and well-trained force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the investigation unfolds, it’s crucial to stay updated with the developments.

While MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi has labeled Meadows’ defense in the Georgia RICO case as “laughable,” it’s evident that the story is more nuanced than just the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meadows’ Defense: A Double-Edged Sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace emphasized the perception that Meadows is backed by strong legal counsel, suggesting that perhaps this sentiment has been blown out of proportion. Frank Figliuzzi weighed in, noting, “He does have a respected lawyer. The lesson is you can’t out-lawyer crime.” He indicated that Meadows’ efforts in the legal realm might encounter significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one can predict the outcome, Meadows, given his long-standing experience in politics, is likely well-aware of the ramifications and is probably strategizing with his legal team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figliuzzi hinted at potential cooperation between Meadows and investigators, suggesting that Meadows might be in a difficult spot. And while this is pure speculation, such high-profile cases often come with a myriad of challenges. Meadows’ ability to navigate these will be under keen observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram clash, Hollywood actress Halle Berry voiced her disapproval when rapper Drake and singer SZA used a 2012 photograph of her to promote their fresh track “Slime You Out.” What’s the catch? They did it without asking her first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-slimy-situation&quot;&gt;The Slimy Situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial photo features Berry at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, where she is seen covered from head to toe in the iconic green slime. As it is customary at the Kids’ Choice Awards, celebrities often end up covered in this playful goop. But for Berry, the problem wasn’t the slime – it was its unexpected and unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, both Drake and SZA gave their fans a sneak peek of the song on their Instagram accounts, where they shared the slimed snapshot of Berry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry didn’t remain silent. On her own Instagram, she shared a mysterious message: “SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER GUY…EVEN IF YOU’RE A WOMAN!” Diving into the comments section, Berry further revealed her feelings, saying, “Didn’t get my permission,” and “That’s not cool I thought better of him!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further emphasized, “When people you admire disappoint you you have to be the bigger person and move on!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silence-from-the-stars&quot;&gt;The Silence from the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy, representatives for all three – Berry, Drake, and SZA – haven’t made any public statements addressing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song in the midst of this dispute, “Slime You Out,” was launched on September 15. Interestingly, the artwork for the song will also serve as the cover for Drake’s upcoming album, “For All The Dogs.” The rapper has also recently shared that his fans will have to wait a bit longer for his eighth studio album, now set to drop on October 6.&lt;/p&gt;

This incident underscores the complex challenges at the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-swift-verdict&quot;&gt;A Swift Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Posas Jr., 51, stood before U.S. District Judge Micaela Alvarez last week. The outcome? A hefty sentence of 162 months in prison followed by five years of closely watched release. This decision followed a brief trial held on June 27, where a jury took merely two hours to declare Posas guilty of plotting to traffic cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-incident&quot;&gt;The Incident&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 6, 2022, Posas met up with Alexis Soria Soria, a 25-year-old living unlawfully in the U.S., in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Weslaco, Texas. There, Soria handed over a box to Posas, which was later discovered to contain 20 kilograms of cocaine. The authorities also acquired recordings that captured the duo conversing about the drug deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Homeland Security Investigations had Posas under their radar for quite some time. They even managed to procure recorded phone calls, revealing Posas discussing drug deals for cash with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during his trial, Posas offered a surprising defense. He argued that he believed the box merely contained fruit, rather than the illicit drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-larger-picture&quot;&gt;The Larger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest and subsequent sentencing of a former CBP officer expose vulnerabilities and raise pressing questions about the integrity of those tasked with safeguarding the nation’s borders. The Rio Grande Valley remains a hotspot for both drug and human trafficking activities. Posas’ case stands as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against smuggling and the unexpected actors that can sometimes be found in its web.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a stunning revelation, a former officer of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is sentenced to over a decade in prison for his involvement in a drug smuggling scheme.

But is this truly in the best interest of the American people and domestic energy production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shift from Energy Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located north of Albuquerque in Sandoval County, the affected area spans over 4,200 acres. If this proposal is greenlit, it will not only halt new mining claims and oil and gas development for up to five decades, but it also raises questions on the United States’ commitment to energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who previously pushed for similar actions while in Congress, defended the move. “Today we’re responding to calls from Tribes, elected leaders, and community members who want to see these public lands protected,” she commented. Haaland emphasized the importance of these lands for their cultural significance and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Cost of the Ban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the protection of natural habitats and historical sites is important, it’s equally crucial to consider the country’s energy needs and the potential economic implications of such bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the region possesses a high potential for sand and gravel extraction, which plays a pivotal role in infrastructure projects like roads. By sidelining these resources, not only does the country lose out on valuable domestic energy resources, but there’s also a significant economic blow. The Congressional Budget Office reported a projected decrease of $2 million in federal revenue due to this land withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as the Biden administration maneuvers to pivot the US away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, the tangible impact of these decisions on everyday Americans is profound. With restrictions on domestic energy production, the US could see increased dependence on foreign energy sources, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy security and higher costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Question of Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intent to preserve cultural resources and protect Native American lands is commendable, it’s essential to strike a balance. As we have seen from past actions, including the reversal of Trump-era decisions related to fossil fuel pipelines, the current administration’s approach tends to prioritize global climate ambitions over domestic energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of energy independence and the role of domestic resources in bolstering the US economy, it’s crucial to reassess the long-term implications of such bans. Finding a middle ground that caters to both environmental and energy concerns could be the way forward, ensuring a more stable future for the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden administration recently unleashed a proposal to impose a 50-year ban on mining and oil drilling across thousands of acres in New Mexico, citing protection of wildlife, cultural resources, and Native American lands as reasons.

Finding a middle ground that caters to both environmental and energy concerns could be the way forward, ensuring a more stable future for the American people.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GOP Challenges Exorbitant $24 Billion Ukraine Aid Request</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/19/GOP-Ukraine-Aid-Concerns/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GOP Challenges Exorbitant $24 Billion Ukraine Aid Request" /><published>2023-09-19T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T06:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/19/GOP-Ukraine-Aid-Concerns</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/19/GOP-Ukraine-Aid-Concerns/">&lt;p&gt;As Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky gears up to lobby for further aid this Thursday, GOP members of the House are voicing valid concerns about the hefty $24 billion military and economic aid proposal championed by President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior GOP figure has been forthright, indicating a significant lack of Republican support for such a sizable aid package. Their stance underscores a broader GOP viewpoint that emphasizes scrutinizing foreign aid, especially when domestic challenges are looming large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting Americans First?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Stern, the director of the Heritage Foundation’s budget center, underscored the weight of the proposed aid by putting it in relatable terms: the $24 billion aid equates to an alarming $1,100 per American household. To offer some perspective, a 2022 Federal Reserve study found that an unsettling 37% of Americans are ill-equipped to handle a sudden $400 emergency expense. This statistic, up from 32% just a year ago, sheds light on the financial strain many households are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to allocate such extensive funds to Ukraine becomes even more jarring when considering Biden’s recent pledge to provide a one-time $700 relief payment to Maui fire survivors, which is notably less than the proposed per household aid amount for Ukraine. A recent CNN poll further backs the GOP’s concerns, revealing that 55% of Americans believe Congress should refrain from dispatching additional aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP Voices Grow Louder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One senior GOP lawmaker expressed skepticism about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner’s (R-OH) remarks that Zelensky could sway reluctant Republicans. Dismissing it, the lawmaker humorously stated, “when Turner’s pet unicorn has offspring, I’d like to buy one of the colts,” before getting to the heart of the matter: “We do not have the votes in the Republican conference to do any Ukraine funding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that while Ukraine seeks more financial assistance, there have been significant internal shakeups, with six of its deputy defense ministers recently being let go after the dismissal of Minister Oleksii Reznikov due to a corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of such critical domestic financial challenges and the need for accountability in foreign nations seeking assistance, the GOP’s cautious approach to Ukraine’s aid request resonates as both sensible and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky gears up to lobby for further aid this Thursday, GOP members of the House are voicing valid concerns about the hefty $24 billion military and economic aid proposal championed by President Joe Biden.

Matthew Richards, 41, stands accused of attempting to kill his wife and five children in their home. Following the alleged attack, he is also charged with attempting to set the residence on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disturbing-details&quot;&gt;Disturbing Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harrowing incident occurred on September 16, when emergency services responded to alerts of a disturbance and fire around 3:47 a.m. Upon arriving, firefighters tackled a blaze in the basement of the family home located on Goode Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richards and all the victims were rushed to the hospital. According to the Shawnee Police Department’s press release, the five children and the wife sustained “laceration injuries of varying degrees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath has left Richards with five counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder and one count of aggravated arson with a risk of bodily harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-unexpected-turn&quot;&gt;An Unexpected Turn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crossroads Christian Church, where Richards was employed, showcases a heartwarming biography of him on their website. He is described as “a big kid who loves teaching little kids about Jesus.” The biography paints a contrasting picture, highlighting his marriage to Stephanie since 2003, their five children, and the family’s three rules – emphasizing love for God, people, and sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the shocking incident, the Senior Pastor of Crossroads Church, Kurt Witten, issued a statement requesting respect for the ongoing investigation and urging prayers for the Richards family.&lt;/p&gt;

Labeled by Trump as a “6 Billion Dollar Hostage Deal,” this agreement has drawn attention and criticism from several corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-lopsided-deal&quot;&gt;A Lopsided Deal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid post on Truth Social, Trump declared that this Iran deal has established a “terrible PRECEDENT for the future.” Expressing his concerns, he warned his followers and the general public to “buckle up” for the potential aftermath of such a deal. Highlighting the past reputation of the United States, he remarked that the once “highly respected USA” has now turned into a “laughingstock” globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His comments were in light of the recent event where five U.S. citizens were freed from Iranian custody. In exchange, the U.S. released five Iranian prisoners and unfroze $6 billion in Iranian assets that were under U.S. sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-perspective&quot;&gt;Trump’s Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Trump did commend the release of the American hostages, he heavily criticized the price at which their freedom came. Comparing this situation with his tenure as President, he boasted of bringing home 58 hostages from various countries, including North Korea, without any ransom payments. He implied that his strong stance made countries rethink their hostage negotiation strategies. “Toward the end, it got so that countries didn’t even start the conversation asking for money, because they knew they would not get it,” Trump stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing his critique, Trump expressed his apprehension that such deals might pave the way for what he calls “hostage inflation.” According to him, if countries see that the U.S. is willing to pay billions for the safe return of its citizens, more Americans could potentially be taken hostage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-future-hold&quot;&gt;What’s the Future Hold?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of Trump’s statements is clear. He firmly believes that once a precedent of payment is set, the demands will only increase, leading to more Americans at risk overseas. In his signature style, he concluded by labelling President Biden as “Dumb as a ROCK!” and blaming him for this deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell whether Trump’s fears are realized or if this deal will pave the way for smoother international relations. However, his concerns serve as a reminder to always tread cautiously on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump, known for his candid expressions and unfiltered opinions, blasted President Joe Biden’s recent deal with Iran.

This recent influx surpasses the previous record established merely days ago, where 1,300 migrants crossed within a day. A reality check is in order as these numbers raise alarming concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of U.S. border and immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple reports have revealed that the local migrant processing center in Eagle Pass, initially designed to hold approximately 1,000 individuals, had to be shut down as it had already tripled its capacity. Officials are now scrambling to make accommodations, resulting in migrants being held outdoors. The rapid increase in numbers only underscores the pressing need for an overhaul in the current system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This system is broken,” a source within the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, astonishingly, in a single eight-hour shift, over 700 migrants were taken into custody. With the current infrastructure already stretched thin, the ability of border agents to handle the influx efficiently and humanely is called into question. Sadly, as temperatures are projected to soar to the mid-90s, many of these migrants find themselves awaiting processing outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further south, reports from Piedras Negras, Coahuila, noted that Mexican military officials halted another 1,200 migrants from crossing. But it’s only a matter of time before they attempt again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With processing facilities already bursting at the seams, the situation is becoming untenable. By mid-morning, every Border Patrol agent with a commercial driver’s license in the region had been summoned to transport migrants. Yet hundreds still remained by midday, requiring attention from EMT-trained agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eagle Pass recently witnessed a massive release of migrants into the community due to these constraints. With the processing center running well over its limits, it’s plausible that this trend of mass releases will continue, if not amplify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the release isn’t the end of the challenge. Many migrants find themselves stranded in Eagle Pass without funds, relying on the kindness of residents for rides, money, or meals. Some have reported that shelters, such as Mission Border Hope, will only assist those migrants who have the means to buy a bus ticket out of the town. This leaves many to navigate the over 150 miles to cities like San Antonio on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plight of these migrants underscores the broader issue – a pressing need to address the evident shortcomings in U.S. border and immigration policies. As the streets of Eagle Pass become flooded with hopeful migrants, the sustainability of the current approach is clearly in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">EAGLE PASS, Texas — A small town on the border of Texas is facing a dire situation as over 1,500 migrants crossed into Eagle Pass from Mexico in just six hours.
