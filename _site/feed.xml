A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Elevating Standards - RNC Ups Ante for Third Presidential Debate</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/23/GOP-Debate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Elevating Standards - RNC Ups Ante for Third Presidential Debate" /><published>2023-09-23T08:16:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-23T08:16:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/23/GOP-Debate</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/23/GOP-Debate/">&lt;p&gt;The Republican National Committee (RNC) is raising the stakes for presidential candidates, enforcing stricter qualifying criteria for the third debate in November. This decision intensifies the competitive atmosphere surrounding the GOP’s presidential nomination debates, as candidates must now meet higher polling and donor thresholds to make it to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stricter-criteria-for-candidates&quot;&gt;Stricter Criteria for Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates aiming to participate in the third debate must secure a minimum of 70,000 unique donors, along with 200 donors from at least 20 states, to their campaign or exploratory committee. The decision on these thresholds was taken during a debate committee conference call and is seen as a notable escalation from the previous debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to donor support, candidates must also garner 4% support in two national polls or achieve 4% in one national and two statewide polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, or South Carolina, which are the first four states in the Republican presidential nominating calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-evolving-debate-landscape&quot;&gt;The Evolving Debate Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifying thresholds have been steadily rising with each debate. The first debate, hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee, required candidates to attain 1% in the polls and secure 40,000 donors, allowing eight contenders to face off. For the upcoming second debate, which is set at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California, the criteria were raised to 3% in the polls and 50,000 donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six out of the eight candidates from the first debate have already met the RNC’s heightened criteria for the second debate, including prominent figures like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and former Vice President Mike Pence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allegiance-to-the-party&quot;&gt;Allegiance to the Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from meeting donor and polling thresholds, candidates must also sign a pledge committing their support to the eventual Republican presidential nominee. This agreement prohibits candidates from participating in non-RNC sanctioned debates for the remainder of the 2024 election cycle and mandates data-sharing with the national party committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;former-presidents-stand&quot;&gt;Former President’s Stand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, former President Donald Trump, who met the donor and polling criteria, chose not to sign the RNC’s pledge, citing his significant lead over other candidates. Consequently, he did not attend the first debate and has already arranged alternative plans for the next showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-on-the-race&quot;&gt;Impact on the Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of these stringent norms signifies the RNC’s attempt to streamline the nomination process and ensure that only the most competitive and supported candidates make it to the debate stage. This move is likely to bring forth more focused and substantive discussions, allowing voters to make informed decisions in the run-up to the 2024 Presidential Election. Whether this elevated bar will serve to clarify or complicate the field remains a point of intrigue as the debates unfold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Republican National Committee (RNC) is raising the stakes for presidential candidates, enforcing stricter qualifying criteria for the third debate in November.

Recently, McGraw warmed millions of hearts with his sweet birthday message to his wife, shedding light on their harmonious life together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-love-note-that-strikes-a-chord&quot;&gt;A Love Note that Strikes a Chord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrating 27 years of togetherness, McGraw took to Instagram to share a public love note on Hill’s 56th birthday.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is reportedly on a mission to reinstate the traditional Senate dress code, a policy recently relaxed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). This development suggests a rising disagreement within the party lines over the decorum of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;return-to-formality&quot;&gt;Return to Formality?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchin is believed to be circulating a proposal to restore the formal dress code, requiring Senators to don business attire on the Senate floor. This push comes in direct contrast to Schumer’s recent pronouncement, allowing Senators to choose their preferred dress while on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fettermans-fashion-statement&quot;&gt;Fetterman’s Fashion Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) is particularly noticeable under the new dress code, appearing in sweatshirts and shorts in the Capitol. His unconventional attire, in alignment with his “blue-collar tough guy” persona, contrasts sharply with his Harvard education and seemingly affluent background. His attire has sparked conversations on authenticity, with many questioning the sincerity behind his average joe portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voices-in-opposition&quot;&gt;Voices in Opposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans and even some Democrats seem to support the return to a more formal dress code. They argue that maintaining a degree of formality and dignity is crucial to uphold the reputation of the Senate. Sen. Tommy Tuberville expressed his displeasure with the relaxed dress code, emphasizing his discontent with the casual attires. Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins believes that maintaining a formal dress code is integral to preserving the dignity of the Senate institution.&lt;/p&gt;

While some view the relaxed dress code as a degradation of Senate traditions, others may see it as a step towards modernization and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Manchin’s move to restore formal attire could be interpreted as a pursuit to maintain the sanctity and the revered image of the Senate.

In a discussion on Newsmax’s “American Agenda,” he voiced concerns over the significant influence and control exercised by the authorities during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-impact-on-education&quot;&gt;The Impact on Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson criticized the sweeping measures, such as school shutdowns, arguing they have had severe and long-lasting impacts on the learning and development of children. He believes it could take years, if not decades, for the educational setbacks experienced during the pandemic to be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allegations-of-manipulation&quot;&gt;Allegations of Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former HUD Secretary accuses the government of not prioritizing the welfare of the citizens and focusing instead on controlling and manipulating people. He fears the grave implications if such practices continue and calls for a critical examination of the repercussions of the mandates imposed during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funding-for-at-home-covid-tests&quot;&gt;Funding for At-Home COVID Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement of a $600 million funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests, Carson emphasized the importance of not succumbing to fear and manipulation. This funding initiative is aimed at averting possible shortages during an anticipated rise in coronavirus cases during the colder months and resolving supply chain issues experienced during past surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carsons-clarion-call&quot;&gt;Carson’s Clarion Call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson’s strong message to the American people is to not be “manipulated and terrified by COVID.” He urges rationality and an understanding of the facts surrounding the virus, such as its evolving, typically weaker variants. He warns against unnecessary fear due to increased positive test results and calls for resistance against any attempts to impose further business and school shutdowns which could lead to economic distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-the-people&quot;&gt;We, The People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Carson’s plea is for vigilance and a unified stance by the people against government overreach and control. He emphasizes that it is the collective responsibility of the citizens to assert their rights and safeguard their freedoms against any perceived attempts to disrupt lives and livelihoods under the guise of public health measures. He argues that a repeat of the stringent controls and mandates witnessed during the pandemic could have devastating and lasting impacts on the society and economy, making it imperative for the people to be informed, rational, and resolute in their response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Ben Carson, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, raises the alarm on what he perceives as attempts by the U.S. government to control the American populace through mandates related to COVID-19.

Funding for At-Home COVID Tests In response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement of a $600 million funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests, Carson emphasized the importance of not succumbing to fear and manipulation. This funding initiative is aimed at averting possible shortages during an anticipated rise in coronavirus cases during the colder months and resolving supply chain issues experienced during past surges. Carson’s Clarion Call Carson’s strong message to the American people is to not be “manipulated and terrified by COVID.” He urges rationality and an understanding of the facts surrounding the virus, such as its evolving, typically weaker variants. He warns against unnecessary fear due to increased positive test results and calls for resistance against any attempts to impose further business and school shutdowns which could lead to economic distress. We, The People In conclusion, Carson’s plea is for vigilance and a unified stance by the people against government overreach and control. He emphasizes that it is the collective responsibility of the citizens to assert their rights and safeguard their freedoms against any perceived attempts to disrupt lives and livelihoods under the guise of public health measures. He argues that a repeat of the stringent controls and mandates witnessed during the pandemic could have devastating and lasting impacts on the society and economy, making it imperative for the people to be informed, rational, and resolute in their response.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Standoff at Capitol Hill - Trump Provokes GOP to Use Shutdown as Leverage</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Standoff at Capitol Hill - Trump Provokes GOP to Use Shutdown as Leverage" /><published>2023-09-22T15:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-22T15:08:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/22/Trump-Government-Shutdown/">&lt;p&gt;With the tides of politics swirling, former President Donald Trump steps into the current fray, encouraging the Republican party to use potential government shutdowns as leverage against the policies of the current administration led by President Joe Biden. This confrontation is bringing to light the battle lines drawn within the GOP, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces internal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiscal-stalemate&quot;&gt;Fiscal Stalemate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal strife within the GOP is marked by fiscal debates, as conservative demands for individual appropriation bills clash with the broader party agenda. Trump’s recent involvement in this dispute emphasizes his enduring influence within the party, as he urges Republicans to “defund all aspects” of what he calls a “weaponized Government” under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-rallying-cry&quot;&gt;Trump’s Rallying Cry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump argued that the Republicans “can and must” obstruct Biden’s policies, depicting the current administration as hostile and accusing it of treating “half the Country as Enemies of the State.” Trump insists this is the opportune moment for Republicans to retaliate against what he perceives as political prosecutions aimed at him and other conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pressure-on-mccarthy&quot;&gt;Pressure on McCarthy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GOP’s internal discord is heightened by figures like Rep. Matt Gaetz, a known critic of McCarthy, who echoes Trump’s calls for Republicans to hold firm against the continuing resolution (C.R.) to maintain government funding at existing levels. This presents an additional challenge to McCarthy’s attempts at holding together differing factions within the party, amidst growing pressure and opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminders of the longest government shutdown in history, stretching over Christmas break from December 2018 to January 2019 under Trump’s administration, hang heavily over these debates. The protracted battle then was over Trump’s sought-after border wall funding, which the Republicans struggled to secure against Democratic opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bipartisan-struggle&quot;&gt;The Bipartisan Struggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid another government shutdown on Oct. 1, both the House and the Democrat-led Senate need to converge on spending legislation acceptable to President Biden.

Now, it seems this fantasy is on the brink of becoming a reality, as scientific innovations and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are forging paths to decode the languages of our fellow earthlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-whisper-to-the-whales-a-chirp-to-the-birds&quot;&gt;A Whisper to the Whales, A Chirp to the Birds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine understanding the sophisticated clicks of sperm whales or the varied chirps of birds! Researchers are using advanced AI to interpret and translate the communications of various animals, ranging from the familiar barks of dogs to the enchanting songs of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Earth Species Project, believes that we are nearing a time when having “conversations” with animals will be feasible. He envisions a future where understanding expressions of ‘grief’, ‘mother’, or ‘hunger’ will be common across different species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-barks-and-tweets&quot;&gt;Beyond Barks and Tweets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about the sounds; researchers are delving deeper, aiming to interpret expressions, postures, and other forms of communication. Dr. Con Slobodchikoff, an animal language researcher, is working on models that translate not just the barks of dogs but also their facial expressions, giving pet owners a clearer understanding of what their furry companions are trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endeavors are not restricted to our traditional pets. Shane Gero, the lead biologist for Project CETI, is employing AI to decipher the intricate patterns of sperm whale sounds, with the hopeful outcome of creating a “whale chatbot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-the-great-divide&quot;&gt;Bridging the Great Divide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary research is about more than mere translation; it’s about bridging the great communication divide between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has developed a tool capable of distinguishing the sounds of over a thousand bird species, and AI-generated bird calls are being tested on zebra finches by the Earth Species Project.&lt;/p&gt;

A formal letter from the UK Parliament’s Culture, Media, and Sports Committee Chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, asked Rumble whether it planned to demonetize comedian and commentator Russell Brand’s channel following serious allegations of rape and sexual assault against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parliaments-appeal-and-rumbles-stance&quot;&gt;Parliament’s Appeal and Rumble’s Stance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to Rumble came in the wake of YouTube’s decision to demonetize Brand’s account. The UK Parliament expressed concerns over Brand profiting from content on Rumble amidst the grave accusations and inquired about Rumble’s intentions regarding Brand’s ability to earn money on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Rumble issued a staunch response, refusing to demonetize Brand’s channel and labelled the Parliament’s letter as “disturbing”. They defended their stance on the grounds of upholding free speech and the principle that every individual is entitled to a full and serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rumble stands for very different values. We have devoted ourselves to the vital cause of defending a free internet – meaning an internet where no one arbitrarily dictates which ideas can or cannot be heard, or which citizens may or may not be entitled to a platform,” Rumble said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-allegations-against-brand&quot;&gt;The Allegations Against Brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple women have accused Russell Brand of rape and sexual assault, as reported by Channel 4 news network and the Sunday Times in Britain. Brand, however, has vehemently denied all the allegations against him. These serious accusations have led various platforms to review their relationships with Brand, and some, like YouTube, to take decisive action against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-implications-and-repercussions&quot;&gt;Wider Implications and Repercussions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumble argues that the allegations against Brand, which are yet to be proven in a court of law, are not related to his video content, and it is “deeply inappropriate and dangerous” for the UK Parliament to attempt to control who is allowed to speak on their platform or to earn a living from doing so. They highlighted the absence of any connection between the allegations and his content on Rumble as a significant factor in their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok and other media outlets, including the BBC, Channel 4, and GB News, have also been approached by the committee for clarification on their positions regarding Brand and his ability to monetize his posts, especially those related to the allegations against him.&lt;/p&gt;
