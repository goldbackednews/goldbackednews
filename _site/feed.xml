A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital IDs on the Horizon - A Slippery Slope to Surveillance?</title><link href="/news/2023/09/11/Digital-Overreach/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital IDs on the Horizon - A Slippery Slope to Surveillance?" /><published>2023-09-11T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-11T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/11/Digital-Overreach</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/11/Digital-Overreach/">&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent push for global digital ID systems, akin to coronavirus passports, at the G20 Summit’s “One Future” session has ignited fierce debates. While she touts them as the future of global digital infrastructure, many view these initiatives as a grave step towards omnipresent surveillance, eroding personal freedoms and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital era, although prosperous and convenient, comes with significant challenges. One of the most alarming is the potential to turn tools meant for connectivity into tools of control. Von der Leyen’s endorsement of a global regulatory body for Artificial Intelligence (AI) — mirroring the structure of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — raises the question: who gets to set the standards, and how will they be enforced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;von der Leyen praised the European Union’s development of a coronavirus digital certificate, pointing out its adoption by 51 countries across four continents. While she sees this as a testament to its functionality and trustworthiness, many fear that such widespread adoption of a single digital ID system puts immense power in the hands of few and reduces the anonymity and privacy of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s ongoing effort to introduce a “digital identity” app, aiming to consolidate a citizen’s essential data, including passport details, driver’s license, and credit cards, has added fuel to the fire. Given that such information is a treasure trove for cybercriminals, the security implications alone are staggering. But more so, the app’s existence could provide governments with unprecedented access to personal information, raising the specter of an Orwellian future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes’s warning earlier this year resounds even more today. He termed the digital ID system push as potentially leading to the “Chinafication” of Europe. Drawing parallels with Communist China’s surveillance mechanisms, Terhes’s statement underscores concerns that Europe might be on a similar trajectory, sacrificing privacy at the altar of supposed convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s plan to potentially introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) further intensifies these apprehensions. Beyond the economic implications, a CBDC could provide an infrastructure for governments to monitor, and possibly control, individual financial transactions, curtailing financial freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While digital transformation and global standardization have undeniable merits, the cost of personal freedom and privacy should be paramount. As the line between connectivity and control blurs, one must ask: are we inadvertently laying the foundation for a digital dystopia?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent push for global digital ID systems, akin to coronavirus passports, at the G20 Summit’s “One Future” session has ignited fierce debates.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has cast a shadow over former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of the alleged influence peddling saga. In a revealing conversation, Johnson pulled no punches, stating that Obama was “fully aware of a lot of this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning his claim with significant details, Johnson shed light on the fact that the Obama State Department was more than just familiar with the alleged influence peddling associated with Hunter Biden. To add fuel to the fire, Johnson explained, “President Obama was briefed, together with Vice President Biden, by then-CIA Director John Brennan about the scheme that the Hillary Clinton campaign had to accuse the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a hard-hitting assertion, Johnson underlined that Obama was in the know about the concocted narrative of Russian collusion. “President Obama knew full well that the Russian collusion scheme false narrative was a hoax,” he stated firmly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the steps taken against Michael Flynn, he mentioned, “They certainly set up Michael Flynn so that he would never be involved in the Trump White House because he was just too dangerous. He knew too much.” For Johnson, the Obama administration’s actions toward Flynn smacked of ulterior motives, which he says extends to the broader influence peddling episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) recently missed a deadline to turn over documents associated with then-Vice President Joe Biden’s alias email accounts. These records are of particular interest to the House Oversight Committee, which is meticulously combing through the Hunter Biden situation. As it stands, the Biden White House and former President Obama have received the documents, with permission pending for their release to the Oversight Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson, expressing his growing exasperation, stated, “Sen. Grassley and I have written multiple letters, three to the White House, starting in the summer of 2021, asking for those same documents.” He emphasized the consistent stonewalling they’ve faced from the current administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a direct jab at Obama, Johnson remarked, “I don’t know why he’s not allowing to release them now,” hinting at possible inconsistencies in Obama’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s revelations point to a possible impeachment inquiry, emphasizing the duty of Congress to maintain constitutional oversight.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliving-the-past-to-shape-our-future&quot;&gt;Reliving The Past to Shape Our Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important to pause and remember what happened,” said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Washington. “It shapes our path forward.” The attacks were not just a series of unfortunate events; they altered the course of countless lives, cities, and the nation’s collective consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-legacy-continues&quot;&gt;The Legacy Continues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, participants of the 9/11 Promise Run brandished American flags, a stark reminder of the unity and strength the nation exhibited post the attacks. Christopher “Dom” Colasanti, a bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, was one of the many who lost their lives during the World Trade Center attack. Bradley remembers him as a teammate from Dartmouth College. He recalls the dedication of the men’s varsity locker room in honor of Colasanti, signifying the bonds and friendships formed there. The legacy of such individuals, characterized by connecting, serving, joy, and love, endures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sacrifices-and-acts-of-bravery&quot;&gt;Sacrifices and Acts of Bravery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the chaos and devastation, first responders across the country raced into peril, exemplifying bravery and selflessness. Their unflinching commitment serves as a constant source of inspiration. “Love includes sacrifice,” Bradley asserts, urging everyone to read about Todd Beamer’s final moments. Beamer, aboard Flight 93, courageously confronted the hijackers, preventing further potential devastation in the nation’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting 1 John 3:16, Pastor Bradley emphasizes, “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-healing-and-purpose-in-faith&quot;&gt;Trust, Healing, and Purpose in Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anchoring his message in faith, Bradley references the national motto, “In God We Trust.” A relationship with God, he believes, offers healing, restoration, and an unyielding hope surpassing any sorrow. Echoing Psalm 46:10, he emphasizes, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pastor concludes with a powerful call to action, cautioning against complacency and idolatry. He inspires with the words, “If you are overcoming tragedy and trauma, remember that you are loved.” The message is clear: On the anniversary of September 11th and always, “We remember our loved ones,” and we discover peace and profound purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">As the 22nd anniversary of the fateful September 11th terror attacks dawns, Pastor Jesse Bradley from Auburn, Washington, underscores the importance of taking a moment to recall the tragic events that reshaped the nation.

Former President Donald Trump, in a charged address to the South Dakota GOP convention, stated unequivocally that his recent indictment is a move by political opponents threatened by his consistent lead in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With numbers that show him not just leading in the Republican primary but also outpacing incumbent President Joe Biden in a hypothetical general election match-up, Trump emphasized, “They indicted me because I’m in first place.” This is not just a claim of personal targeting, but a grave concern for the integrity of the nation’s political system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump highlighted the peril of his political success, indicating that every surge in his popularity seems to coincide with intensified scrutiny. Expressing his frustration, he mused, “Maybe I should announce, ‘I’m doing horribly; it’s horrible, I’m going to withdraw,” pointing to the irony of his situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t just about one man’s political journey. Trump underscored a systemic issue, indicating that the current strategy of his opponents seems to focus on “interfering with elections” to diminish the chances of Republicans and conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former President’s call to arms wasn’t limited to his situation. He fervently encouraged congressional Republicans to take decisive actions against these perceived politically-motivated indictments. Drawing attention to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Trump urged for more robust action, advocating for the defunding of the DOJ and prosecutors believed to be sidelining conservatives through non-meritorious indictments.&lt;/p&gt;

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s (D) 30-day ban on concealed carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shocking, yet commendable act of defiance came swiftly in response to the ban which had only taken effect on Saturday, September 8, 2023. The hastily-imposed prohibition not only prevents the concealed carrying of handguns but also bars open carry, effectively disarming lawful citizens in places such as Albuquerque, located in Bernalillo County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Grisham’s rash directive targets even licensed concealed carriers. In an era where citizens are encouraged to be more self-reliant for their safety and well-being, such decrees seem wildly out of touch with the core values upon which the nation was founded.&lt;/p&gt;

Bregman, standing as a beacon for constitutional rights and the Second Amendment, stated, “As an officer of the court, I cannot and will not enforce something that is clearly unconstitutional.” He further emphasized that his office would remain dedicated to pursuing actual criminals who misuse firearms for illegal endeavors, rather than infringing upon law-abiding citizens’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoing this sentiment of upholding foundational American rights, New Mexico state rep. John Block (R) fired back at Grisham’s order, rallying for her impeachment and receiving vocal support: “Impeach and remove Lujan Grisham. We even have Elon behind us on this!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding weight to the collective rejection of this ill-conceived ban, Albuquerque police chief Harold Medina unequivocally stated that he would not be enforcing the governor’s order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching message? The people of Albuquerque, their representatives, and their law enforcement, stand united against what they see as tyranny and infringement on their constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the National Association of Gun Rights is taking the fight directly to the courts, having already filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in New Mexico against the ban.

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s (D) 30-day ban on concealed carry. This shocking, yet commendable act of defiance came swiftly in response to the ban which had only taken effect on Saturday, September 8, 2023. The hastily-imposed prohibition not only prevents the concealed carrying of handguns but also bars open carry, effectively disarming lawful citizens in places such as Albuquerque, located in Bernalillo County.

The politicization of the military and the current state of the labor market, among other factors, seem to be more significant drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;declining-pool-of-potential-recruits&quot;&gt;Declining Pool of Potential Recruits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Feaver, a distinguished professor at Duke University and ex-member of the National Security Council, points out that concerns about “woke” policies have been overly emphasized. He highlights underlying problems such as the shrinking pool of eligible young Americans. Health issues, drug use, and obesity have led to a reduced pool of potential recruits compared to two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver’s recent publication, “Thanks For Your Service,” delves into the waning public trust in the military. Despite the military’s 60% public confidence as per a recent Gallup poll, this figure represents the lowest since 1997 and is a disturbing trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-at-play&quot;&gt;Politics at Play?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver believes that a significant share of the declining confidence can be attributed to politics. Claims of the military becoming “woke” have perhaps added fuel to this fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has voiced concerns over the damaging image the military has received from its critics. Wormuth highlights how criticisms surrounding a “woke military” might have inadvertently influenced recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent political figures, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have criticized the Pentagon’s newly introduced diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, suggesting that they have resulted in recruitment setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-balanced-perspective&quot;&gt;A Balanced Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s essential to strike a balance. Feaver indicates that while some progressive talking points might permeate military training, it’s only a fraction of the military’s overall training focus. The narrative of the military facing a “woke” or extremist issue may not be as pervasive as projected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver emphasizes the importance of refraining from hyperbole when discussing the military. He suggests granting the military “non-combatant immunity in the culture wars,” allowing for a more nuanced, less politically charged conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver underscores the broader challenges that the military faces in recruitment. The appeal of the civilian job market and the sacrifices associated with military service make recruitment inherently challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Feaver notes, politicizing the military only exacerbates an already complex issue. While adjusting rhetoric can help, a holistic approach, understanding the myriad of underlying challenges, will be crucial for the future of U.S. military recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">While claims circulate that “woke” Pentagon policies are amplifying the U.S. military’s recruitment challenge, experts suggest that the issue might be deeper and more systemic.

Ted Cruz, an unwavering voice for conservative values, faces his 2024 re-election bid with fierce determination. Recognizing the sizeable group of Democrats eager to challenge his seat, Cruz prepares to defend the GOP’s long-held stronghold in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his victory over then-Rep. Beto O’Rourke in 2018, Cruz showed that Texans remain committed to their Republican roots, even in the face of immense Democratic funding and campaign efforts. As Cruz aptly noted, following former President Donald Trump, “there is no Republican in the country that Democrats would more ardently like to unseat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Democrats are coming in with all guns blazing, with Rep. Colin Allred leading the charge. Allred’s fundraising efforts managed to exceed Cruz’s by almost $2 million in Q2 2023, showing the extent of the Democrats’ fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, history remains on the GOP’s side. Texas, a beacon of conservative governance, continues to resist turning blue, regardless of Democrats’ efforts. Cal Jillson, a renowned political science professor at Southern Methodist University, reinforced this sentiment, noting, “It’s probably not ruby red, but it’s still a red state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Democrats, once dominant in Texas from the post-Civil War era through the 1970s, have been repeatedly challenged since the 1980s. With stalwarts like the Bush family frequently representing the state, Texas has stayed red in presidential, senate, and gubernatorial elections for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent election results further underscore Texas’ conservative leanings. Although Cruz’s 2018 race and Trump’s 2020 results hinted at closer margins, the GOP has continued to triumph. For instance, in 2022, Gov. Greg Abbott asserted GOP dominance, defeating O’Rourke with a decisive near-11 point lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jillson points to the evolving nature of the GOP electorate in Texas. While the party once leaned heavily toward business-friendly conservatism, today’s GOP in Texas boasts a robust mix of social conservatives and populists, advocating more vehemently for conservative principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ever-changing political landscape, the GOP remains focused on rallying Hispanic voters, a demographic pivotal to future elections. While Democrats may tout their hold on two out of three heavily Latino districts, Republicans have begun making strides with male Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley. This trend could shape future GOP campaigns in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

Demonstrating his trademark charisma, Trump partied with an Iowa State fraternity, showcased his grill skills, and engaged with the crowd by throwing footballs, further underlining his dominant position in the 2024 GOP nomination race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a spirited pre-game event, Trump visited the Alpha Gamma Rho (AGR) agriculture fraternity house at Iowa State University in Ames. Not one to stick to convention, the former president threw footballs from a beer pong table into the waiting crowd. These candid moments were interspersed with Trump flipping burgers and posing for photographs with fraternity members, all of which undoubtedly added to his ever-growing allure among supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vivacity carried over to the game, with the crowd erupting into cheers upon Trump’s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the backdrop of these events, Trump’s stronghold on the GOP nomination seems increasingly unassailable. Recent polling by Civiqs in association with Iowa State reveals Trump holding a majority with 51% support. This places him well ahead of competitors, notably Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who stands at a mere 14% support in Iowa, despite his team’s prior emphasis on the state’s significance for his campaign. DeSantis’ team, recalibrating their stance, suggested that even a “strong second” in Iowa might suffice, with a campaign official even stating, “&lt;em&gt;I don’t think there’s a single state we have to win&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to Trump’s momentum is the recent endorsement from South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. Once seen as a potential rival for the 2024 nomination, Noem’s endorsement further solidifies Trump’s status as the frontrunner in the GOP race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what was ostensibly a day of sport, Trump adeptly blended politics and entertainment, leaving an indelible impression on Iowa’s electorate and amplifying his message for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Iowa witnessed an exuberant political spectacle on Saturday as former President Donald Trump turned a college football game into an informal campaign rally.
