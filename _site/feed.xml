A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Gavin’s Choices - The Reimagination of California’s Political Landscape</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/06/Newsom-California-Appointments/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gavin’s Choices - The Reimagination of California’s Political Landscape" /><published>2023-10-06T13:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-06T13:02:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/06/Newsom-California-Appointments</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/06/Newsom-California-Appointments/">&lt;p&gt;With the passing of Senator Dianne Feinstein at the age of 90, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom finds himself in the singular position of appointing individuals to the state’s most influential political roles, shaping the Golden State’s future political panorama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-governors-palette&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Governor’s Palette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vacancy left by Feinstein gives Newsom the unprecedented opportunity to handpick appointees to all of California’s pivotal positions. He had previously appointed Alex Padilla to fill the seat vacated by now Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021. With his authority extending over the appointments of two senators, the secretary of state, and the state’s attorney general, Newsom is perceived as wielding the brush that colors California’s political canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsom’s appointments have the power to define the political and legislative trajectory of the state. These roles are instrumental in steering policies, legislative decisions, and statewide initiatives. The appointments will impact various aspects of California’s political, economic, and social spheres, highlighting Newsom’s vision for the state’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commitment-and-controversy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment and Controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Governor Newsom had vowed to appoint a Black woman to the U.S. Senate should a vacancy arise. However, he has recently opted for a more interim approach, stating his preference to avoid involvement in the primary. Newsom’s careful maneuvering in these appointments has sparked debates on his commitments and the implications of his selections on the state’s Democratic primaries and overall political equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-act&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision of who will fill these vital roles brings forth the complex task of balancing promise, performance, preference, and politics. There’s an expectation for Newsom to consider candidates who will address critical issues such as inflation, homelessness, and crime, and not merely pursue national recognition or indulge in polarizing political discourse. California Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher emphasized the hope that Newsom’s selections would be driven by performance over politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;california-at-a-crossroad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California at a Crossroad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfolding scenario places California at a strategic crossroad, where the governor’s appointments will play a decisive role in shaping the state’s ideological and legislative outlook. It draws attention to Newsom’s commitments, decision-making, and the resulting political landscape of California. The Governor’s choices, invariably, will sculpt the political narrative and policy directions of the state in the foreseeable future, marking a pivotal moment in California’s political evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Governor Newsom’s successive appointments underscore a transformative phase for California, where the implications of each selection will reverberate through the state’s political corridors, potentially redefining California’s identity on the national stage. The impact of Newsom’s choices will not only shape the immediate political climate but will also etch the pathways for the state’s long-term political, social, and economic journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">With the passing of Senator Dianne Feinstein at the age of 90, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom finds himself in the singular position of appointing individuals to the state’s most influential political roles, shaping the Golden State’s future political panorama.

What makes this case even more shocking? McClellan had been released from jail merely a week prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident, captured in vivid detail by surveillance cameras, unfolded when McClellan, driving a previously stolen Toyota, parked beside a woman who was in the process of refueling her SUV. Within moments, he allegedly dashed from his car to hers, clambering into the driver’s seat to make his escape. Despite the woman’s brave attempts to thwart him, a brief tussle ensued, culminating with McClellan driving away, dragging the woman several feet in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning Leveille, an eyewitness to the event, recounted to FOX 35 Orlando how she watched in disbelief from a nearby traffic light. She recalled the victim’s desperate pleas: “She was like, ‘Get out of my car!’ And he said, ‘No.’” Leveille, along with a store clerk, later provided assistance to the injured woman as they awaited the arrival of the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the drama didn’t end with the carjacking. McClellan’s subsequent arrest in Daytona Beach by local police came with its own set of challenges. Officers had to physically subdue him after he reportedly tried to attack them following an initial attempt to escape his handcuffs. His behavior escalated further when he tried to tighten a restraining device around his neck in the back of a police vehicle, necessitating hospital transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backdrop to this entire episode is rife with controversy. McClellan, the alleged carjacker, had tasted freedom for only a handful of days. He was released from jail on September 29, after charges from a prior case were dropped due to its unsuitability for prosecution. A document from the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s office provided insight into this, revealing that the charges — which included burglary of a structure, petit theft, and criminal mischief — were deemed unsuitable for prosecution. Further adding to the controversy, McClellan was released from jail without formal charges filed in another case, in accordance with Florida laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the residents of Florida, this chain of events has sparked concern and debate, prompting many to question the state’s judicial system and processes. As the story unfolds, communities await further developments, hoping for justice and a resolution that ensures safety for all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a startling turn of events, Andrew McClellan, a 31-year-old Florida man, was taken into custody for allegedly carjacking a woman at a Mobil gas station in Apopka.

Jim Jordan in the highly-anticipated race for the Speaker of the House. Making the announcement on his TRUTH Social platform, Trump lauded Jordan’s impressive track record, both in the wrestling ring and within the political arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s endorsement shined a spotlight on Jordan’s illustrious past. The Congressman from Ohio’s 4th Congressional District boasted a formidable wrestling record during his high school and university years. A State Championship winner for four straight years in high school with an astonishing 156-1 record, Jordan continued his winning streak at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, earning two NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond his sports accomplishments, Jordan also holds a master’s degree in Education from Ohio State University and a Law Degree from Capital University. Trump emphasized Jordan’s unwavering stances on crime, military and veterans’ affairs, border security, and the 2nd Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current race for the House Speaker position has seen several significant shifts. Following the historical removal of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, both Rep. Jim Jordan and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise announced their candidacy. With Trump’s recent endorsement, Jordan’s bid for the position seems to have gained considerable momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected twist has added drama to the unfolding political saga. Trump revealed to Fox News Digital that if the Republican party struggles to unite behind either Jordan or Scalise, he would be open to accepting a temporary speakership role. Emphasizing that his primary focus remains his presidential campaign, Trump expressed his willingness to step in for a “short period” – potentially 30 to 90 days – if it serves the best interest of the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race for the Speaker’s chair isn’t just about political positions; it’s about unifying the party. Jordan, with his history of rallying both moderates and conservatives, seems poised to garner the required 218 votes, as highlighted by a congressional source speaking to Fox News Digital. Given the current dynamics, Trump’s endorsement has provided a significant boost to Jordan’s campaign, further underscoring his potential as a unifying figure within the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As political analysts and enthusiasts watch closely, the developments around the House Speaker race promise a gripping narrative for U.S. politics, with consequences that will shape the direction of the Republican party and, potentially, the nation itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Rep.

This significant surge, reported by the Department of Labor, might be signaling the Federal Reserve to reconsider its interest rates in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, economic analysts had projected the creation of around 160,000 jobs for September. The actual numbers have surpassed even the most optimistic estimates by a significant margin. Concurrently, the unemployment rate has stabilized at 3.8%, contrary to the anticipated drop to 3.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures follow previously adjusted numbers for July and August. Initially, July reported 157,000 new jobs which later saw a revision to 236,000. August’s employment was also adjusted from 187,000 to 227,000. Collectively, these adjustments signify an increase of 119,000 jobs beyond the initially reported figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next move is rife. With the robust job growth, there’s growing pressure on the Federal Reserve to reconsider hiking interest rates in their upcoming meeting at the end of October. Notably, during their last assembly in September, the decision was to maintain current rates, aiming to observe the effects of previous rate increases on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent data from the Labor Department sheds light on the vitality of the job market. A staggering 9.61 million job listings were recorded on the last day of August, eclipsing earlier estimates. This could imply that many businesses, witnessing a robust job market, no longer anticipate a looming recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the labor market hasn’t been without its challenges. Demonstrations of this include the recent strikes led by labor unions, such as the notable strike by the United Auto Workers members against General Motors in Lansing, Michigan. Despite these disruptions, employers remain resilient. An indicator of this is the jobless claims totaling 207,000 during the seven-day period ending September 27. Historically, this is considerably low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the private sector’s contribution to this growth can’t be overlooked. They’ve accounted for 263,000 of the new jobs, overshadowing ADP’s reported 89,000. It’s essential to note that ADP, a prominent payroll processor, has stated that its figures are now independent of the Labor Department’s data and should be viewed as a distinct economic insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the U.S. economy’s robust job growth in September provides a beacon of hope and optimism. It’s a testament to the resilience of businesses and workers alike. As we await the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming decisions, one thing is clear: the U.S. labor market is thriving against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In an unexpected twist, U.S. employers have outdone economic forecasts by adding a whopping 336,000 jobs in September.

&lt;p&gt;Adam Fleischman, known as the Iron Chef winner and the mastermind behind the famed Umami Burger, found himself in a controversial situation when he was accused of squatting in an older woman’s Hollywood residence. The accuser, identified only as Claudia, alleges that Fleischman lived in her home without paying rent since May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash Shelton, a handyman with a unique specialty of evicting squatters, filmed his confrontation with Fleischman and shared it online, creating a whirlwind of media attention. Fleischman, in his defense, claims that his intentions were to be a lawful tenant. He states that he was never provided with a lease or keys, hinting at landlord negligence. “She did not ask for rent for the first 2-3 months. I thought she had some sort of arrangement or credit,” Fleischman mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claudia’s frustration was evident, especially when she described her inability to legally evict Fleischman without court intervention. “The system is broken,” she declared, adding that even after persistent requests for Fleischman to vacate, law enforcement stated they couldn’t assist due to the situation being a civil matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial connection between Fleischman and Claudia began when she posted an ad on Craigslist, seeking individuals to help with the rent. The two conceived an idea of hosting dinner parties at the home to generate income, a seemingly perfect collaboration given Fleischman’s culinary background. Yet, things went south. Claudia accuses the chef of not compensating her for an event and even alleges misuse of her credit card for event-related purchases, which Fleischman vehemently denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelton, who has previously evicted squatters from his mother’s home, offered his assistance to Claudia pro bono. He voiced his disbelief at the entire situation, struggling to comprehend how Fleischman could reside in the home without any sense of obligation towards Claudia. Videos captured by Shelton display LAPD officers permitting him to install cameras in the residence for monitoring, indicating the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst this chaotic backdrop, Shelton is utilizing the heightened attention to advocate for a change in squatting laws. He has initiated a GoFundMe campaign to support his efforts in aiding others facing squatter troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Fleischman, his recent ventures have been rocky. He launched a restaurant named Slow Burn in 2022, but it mysteriously shuttered shortly after its opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story serves as a stark reminder that even in the glittering world of Hollywood, disputes over home and hearth can take unexpected turns. As Shelton remarked, “It’s a shame for that to happen to anyone… It doesn’t give you a reason to tear somebody else down.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Handymen and celebrity chefs aren’t typically a combo featured in the same story, but Hollywood brought the unexpected pairing together in a peculiar scenario.

Claudia’s frustration was evident, especially when she described her inability to legally evict Fleischman without court intervention. “The system is broken,” she declared, adding that even after persistent requests for Fleischman to vacate, law enforcement stated they couldn’t assist due to the situation being a civil matter. The initial connection between Fleischman and Claudia began when she posted an ad on Craigslist, seeking individuals to help with the rent. The two conceived an idea of hosting dinner parties at the home to generate income, a seemingly perfect collaboration given Fleischman’s culinary background. Yet, things went south. Claudia accuses the chef of not compensating her for an event and even alleges misuse of her credit card for event-related purchases, which Fleischman vehemently denies. Shelton, who has previously evicted squatters from his mother’s home, offered his assistance to Claudia pro bono. He voiced his disbelief at the entire situation, struggling to comprehend how Fleischman could reside in the home without any sense of obligation towards Claudia. Videos captured by Shelton display LAPD officers permitting him to install cameras in the residence for monitoring, indicating the gravity of the situation. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, Shelton is utilizing the heightened attention to advocate for a change in squatting laws. He has initiated a GoFundMe campaign to support his efforts in aiding others facing squatter troubles. As for Fleischman, his recent ventures have been rocky. He launched a restaurant named Slow Burn in 2022, but it mysteriously shuttered shortly after its opening. This story serves as a stark reminder that even in the glittering world of Hollywood, disputes over home and hearth can take unexpected turns. As Shelton remarked, “It’s a shame for that to happen to anyone… It doesn’t give you a reason to tear somebody else down.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sage Steele Sheds Light on Biden’s Mental State in Maher Interview</title><link href="/news/2023/10/05/Sage-Steele-Biden-Revelation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sage Steele Sheds Light on Biden’s Mental State in Maher Interview" /><published>2023-10-05T17:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-05T17:45:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/05/Sage-Steele-Biden-Revelation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/05/Sage-Steele-Biden-Revelation/">&lt;p&gt;Sage Steele, the ex-ESPN anchor, stirred up headlines recently when she divulged a disconcerting interaction with President Biden during an interview on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steele shed light on an episode in March 2021 when she interviewed the President. She conveyed her concerns regarding what she believed was Biden’s cognitive decline, particularly when he “trailed off” during a chat before their scheduled recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was trying just to fill time. And he said, ‘You know, I used to play football’… And so he started to tell football stories of his greatness… He said ‘I was good’ and then he went silent and he goes ‘Uhh… never mind,’” recalled Steele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher, known for his candid observations, drew comparisons to a scene from a ‘Naked Gun’ movie. Steele’s poignant description left many wondering about the President’s fitness for office, given the high demands of the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Steele’s revelations didn’t stop there. She went on to discuss her unexpected encounter with former President Trump at his Bedminster golf course. Their connection revolved around their shared love for football and Trump’s endeavors to rejuvenate sports post-COVID. Steele also confessed to being “thoroughly entertained” by Trump’s audacious tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher’s astonishment was palpable as he found out that Steele didn’t cast her vote for either Biden or Barack Obama in previous elections. Steele was quick to clarify, “I don’t love [Trump]. There’s a big difference in voting for someone and loving them.” She emphasized the importance of differentiating between politicians’ personal attributes and their policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recent revelation from Steele, combined with the ever-politicized climate, further underscores the need for transparency and candid discussions about our nation’s leaders. As the public digests Steele’s unsettling observations, questions regarding the competency of those in power remain at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Sage Steele, the ex-ESPN anchor, stirred up headlines recently when she divulged a disconcerting interaction with President Biden during an interview on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast.

This Wednesday, Trump’s adept legal team persistently sought clarity from accountant Donald Bender, whose preparation of the financial statements is currently in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, propelled by New York Attorney General Letitia James, accuses Trump and his renowned business of overstating his wealth in financial documents provided to financial institutions. Many observers see this as a politically charged move against the former president. In a striking revelation, Bender admitted that the Trump Organization hadn’t always been provided with comprehensive guidelines for these documents. Rather than accepting accountability for possible oversights, Bender tried to shift the blame elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Jesus M. Suarez brilliantly highlighted a pivotal moment, referencing a pretrial video testimony. Bender, caught off guard, expressed doubt about having consulted with any specialists when forming Trump’s financial statements. The defense rightly pinpointed an overlooked detail about the size of Trump’s Trump Tower apartment, suggesting that the burden of this miscalculation should not fall squarely on the Trump Organization. In response, Bender appeared to backtrack, suggesting the oversight was a collective error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trial proceedings intensified, Judge Arthur Engoron seemed impatient with Trump’s defense team’s thorough line of questioning. In a surprising move, he attempted to expedite the questioning, which the defense rightfully argued would restrict their ability to adequately represent the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial, perceived by many as an extension of political maneuvering, could have broad implications. Although Judge Engoron hastily ruled that Trump allegedly inflated the value of certain assets, Trump’s lawyers have launched an appeal. Many believe this ruling, which could jeopardize Trump’s ownership of properties like the Trump Tower, seems heavy-handed given the trial’s politically charged backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making headlines is Trump’s unwavering commitment to clearing his name. Despite being in the midst of his 2024 presidential campaign trail, Trump chose to be present at the trial. Outside the court, he voiced his concerns about the proceedings, describing James as “incompetent” and emphasizing his desire to shed light on the perceived injustices of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James was quick to counter, but her remarks came across as more of a rehearsed political statement than a genuine retort. She labeled Trump’s involvement as a “political stunt,” a claim that seems ironic given the nature of the lawsuit itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s candid remarks outside the court, especially directed towards Engoron’s team, eventually led to a restraining order on his comments. In line with his commitment to transparency and fairness, Trump promptly complied by removing a post that was deemed offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the trial set to decide upon potential penalties of up to $250 million and possible restrictions on Trump’s business operations in New York, many see it as an attempt to sideline the former president. But as always, Trump remains resolute in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump once again showcased his unyielding spirit in the face of the New York civil fraud trial that many are describing as politically motivated.

&lt;p&gt;Jesperson’s reign of terror spanned the 1990s. His moniker, “Happy Face,” was derived from the eerie smiley-face signature he left on letters sent to media outlets, where he chillingly detailed his crimes. These heinous acts were committed across various states, while he worked as a long-haul trucker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent, unexpected interview with Okaloosa authorities at the Oregon State Penitentiary, Jesperson made a shocking confession. He revealed details about meeting Kjellenberg at a truck rest stop, stating she was on her way to Lake Tahoe and seeking a ride. The two journeyed together to Cairo, Georgia, even sharing a meal. Their trip took a dark turn on the return leg to Florida. After an altercation in the driver’s lounge of his truck, Jesperson brutally ended Kjellenberg’s life, then dumped her body along the interstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesperson had hinted at this killing previously. After his arrest in 1996, he spoke of murdering a woman named either “Susan” or “Suzette” in August 1994. It wasn’t until the Okaloosa Sheriff’s Office (OSO) made a formal announcement that Kjellenberg’s identity came to light, three decades post the tragic discovery of her remains by an inmate worker crew off Interstate 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSO’s relentless pursuit of the truth saw them partnering with Othram, a leading forensic genetic genealogy lab, in 2022. This collaboration aimed to identify the remains found 28 years earlier. After providing samples to Othram in 2023, a genealogical profile, funded by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), delivered the leads that eventually named Suzanne Kjellenberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District 1 Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deanna Oleske mentioned the entire process took a mere six weeks. On the back of this breakthrough, authorities officially charged Jesperson with Kjellenberg’s murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Eric Aden expressed his gratitude for the perseverance shown over the years. He stated, “Thanks to the tireless efforts of so many over so long, the remains of Suzanne Kjellenberg, the final unidentified victim of Jesperson’s cross-country murder sprees, can finally leave the Medical Examiner’s Office, and return home.”&lt;/p&gt;

This nomination comes at a critical juncture, as the Office of the Special Counsel currently oversees federal whistleblower protections and the investigation of executive branch corruption, including the Justice Department’s inquiries into Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dellinger shares more than just a professional connection with Hunter; both are Yale Law School graduates. They worked together at Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm where Hunter Biden notably sought representation for Burisma Holdings. For those unaware, Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, made payments of $83,000 per month to Hunter for his position on their board. There are allegations, backed by an FBI FD-1023 file and seconded by IRS whistleblower Joseph Ziegler, of bribes amounting to $5 million each for both Joe and Hunter Biden from a Burisma executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains a matter of speculation whether Dellinger provided legal services for Burisma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nomination are weighty. If Dellinger secures the role, he would have jurisdiction over the investigations concerning any retaliation claims by the DOJ against two IRS whistleblowers who argued that the DOJ’s inquiry into Hunter Biden was politically influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments had seen Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) calling on the current Special Counsel, Henry Kerner, to look into alleged meddling. They voiced concerns, stating, “Two IRS whistleblowers and their team faced removal from the Hunter Biden case, seemingly as a retaliation for their legal interactions with Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the fire, Hunter Biden’s legal representative, Abbe Lowell, targeted these IRS whistleblowers a few months ago, hinting at possible legal action by the DOJ for releasing Hunter Biden’s tax details to the House Ways and Means Committee. This incident led to Hunter suing the IRS in September, claiming improper information disclosure by these whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where whistleblowing is deemed essential, IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel emphasizes that IRS employees should be the first to highlight alarming issues. He envisions a proactive environment, encouraging a “see something, say something” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While President Biden’s nomination of Dellinger is under intense scrutiny given the intricate web of connections and ongoing investigations, the broader implication is clear: the forthcoming days in U.S. politics are set to be tumultuous and heavily watched.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In what some might call a controversial move, President Joe Biden has proposed Hampton Dellinger, a past colleague of Hunter Biden, for the prestigious role of White House Special Counsel.
