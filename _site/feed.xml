A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/20/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-20T08:30:40-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-20T08:30:40-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/20/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/20/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Capitol Hill Uproar: Pro-Palestinian Jews Call for Cease-Fire</title><link href="/news/2023/10/20/Capitol-Hill-Protest/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Capitol Hill Uproar: Pro-Palestinian Jews Call for Cease-Fire" /><published>2023-10-20T08:16:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-20T08:16:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/20/Capitol-Hill-Protest</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/20/Capitol-Hill-Protest/">&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON – Capitol Hill was the epicenter of fervor and passion as protesters from all over the U.S. gathered, demanding an end to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Their cries for a cease-fire culminated in the arrest of hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These demonstrators, many of whom identified as Jewish, bore shirts with a powerful message: “Jews say ceasefire now!” Their strong commitment to peace was evident when Liv, a participant from the activist group &lt;strong&gt;Jewish Voice for Peace&lt;/strong&gt;, proclaimed, “We were raised saying ‘Never again.’ That time is now!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the demonstration, approximately 300 protesters were taken into custody, with the U.S. Capitol Police confirming charges of illegal protest inside a House office building for some. Three individuals also faced assault on a police officer charges. But for many demonstrators, this was a necessary act of civil disobedience. Louisa, one of the protesters, emphasized the importance of their message reaching both Congress and President Biden. She fervently expressed the need for U.S. intervention to facilitate a cease-fire and prevent further loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of the demonstration was palpable. Among the sea of protesters were rabbis, children of Holocaust survivors, and supporters from far and wide. One member even traveled from Kansas City after the demonstration was planned merely three days in advance. The objective was clear: convey a strong message to the U.S. leadership that they must act. Michael, another participant, voiced a call for the U.S. to use its significant influence to de-escalate the situation, suggesting a stop in financial support and troop stationing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstration wasn’t without its critics. The Anti-Defamation League’s D.C. chapter voiced concerns, asserting that while these groups claim representation, they do not embody the majority Jewish sentiment. The ADL D.C. Regional Director, Meredith R. Weisel, strongly indicated that challenging Israel’s right to exist, as these anti-Zionist groups do, equates to antisemitism. However, many protesters countered this, emphasizing the diverse perspectives within the Jewish community and their empathy for the Palestinian cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The echoes of the protest weren’t limited to Capitol Hill. Activists from the group &lt;strong&gt;IfNotNow&lt;/strong&gt; reported similar acts of civil disobedience in Boston, targeting the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, pressing her to advocate for a cease-fire.&lt;/p&gt;

Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) shared his insights with Newsmax on Thursday, lauding Trump’s policies while pointing out the pitfalls of the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Johnson, the efficacy of Trump’s strategies on various matters is evident now more than ever. “The successes stemming from Trump’s policies on border security, boosting the economy, and asserting a strong international presence are undeniable,” Johnson asserted on “The Chris Salcedo Show.” He added, “During Trump’s tenure, we witnessed the pinnacle of our economy in the past half-century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson went on to highlight Trump’s triumphs on the international stage, emphasizing the stark contrast between Trump’s and Biden’s tenures. “Under Trump, the world witnessed a more restrained Iran, a Russia that didn’t venture into Ukrainian territory, and a China that, rather than posturing aggressively, collaborated with the U.S. to keep North Korea in check,” he elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Congressman from Ohio did not stop at praising Trump’s accomplishments. He also shared his perspective on how the political landscape can be further improved, spotlighting one glaring issue that remains a bone of contention for many. “The unchecked fiscal habits in Washington, D.C., stand as a major concern,” Johnson expressed. “Even though Republicans have trimmed discretionary spending by vast amounts over the past decade or so, the alarming debt continues to loom large.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson identified the Biden administration’s impulsive expenditure patterns as a significant driver behind this escalating debt. While the Republicans have managed to cut down hundreds of billions over the years, Johnson suggests that the “out-of-cycle” splurging endorsed by the current administration is exacerbating the nation’s financial woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In wrapping up, Rep. Bill Johnson’s comments resonate as a clarion call for a more judicious and reflective approach to policy-making. With the world watching closely, the decisions made in Washington will undeniably have ripple effects, shaping not only America’s future but also the global political tapestry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Recent global events have thrust U.S. political decisions into the spotlight, with many contrasting the approaches of former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden.

The suspect, reportedly attempting to flee with five boxes of the coveted Pokemon Scarlet and Violet “ultra-premium” trading cards, was shot by the store’s clerk, Derrick Guerrero, 33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports from 1 News detail how the situation rapidly escalated. The suspected thief, having grabbed the Pokemon cards, was making a dash for it when Guerrero intervened with fatal consequences. The story took a further tragic turn when it emerged that the wounded suspect managed to reach a car driven by his girlfriend. But, as they sped away from the scene, the girlfriend discerned the seriousness of her boyfriend’s injuries. Pulling over, she promptly dialed 911.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities, upon arrival, ensured the injured man received immediate medical attention. Despite the quick response, the suspect was declared dead at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident is made more complex given recent history. Maj. Al Xiques from the Pembroke Pines police provided some crucial context: “This very GameStop faced a robbery on September 11th of this year, involving different suspects. Interestingly, the victim of that prior incident is the same suspect in the current shooting.” The connection prompts deeper reflections on self-defense and personal safety. It was revealed that, after the September robbery, Guerrero had procured a firearm for his protection— the very same weapon used during this tragic encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Derrick Guerrero, the GameStop clerk at the heart of this event, now faces legal proceedings. He has been officially arrested and charged with manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident, deeply saddening and layered, throws into sharp relief the questions of self-defense rights and the ever-growing popularity of collectible items like Pokemon cards.

The explosion, originating from the engine room, sent shockwaves throughout the community and the wider cruise industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to local reports, a crew member faced grave injuries following the incident and was rushed to a nearby hospital. This individual suffered serious burns to the arms and hands, as cited by the Daily Mail. In addition to the injured crew member, 128 passengers were hurriedly escorted off the ship. The remainder, 82 in total, were the ship’s employees, as confirmed by WGME, a local TV station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the Ocean Navigator, this 286-foot cruise vessel can accommodate 202 people. On that fateful Wednesday, the ship had just positioned itself at the Ocean Gateway Terminal when, around 7:25 a.m., a fire broke out in a generator within the engine room. Thankfully, swift actions by the Portland firefighters and the ship’s own crew ensured the flames were doused quickly. Presently, efforts are underway to clear the smoke from the ship. However, the U.S. Coast Guard has stated that passengers will not be permitted to reboard, as reported by WPFO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ocean Navigator, constructed in 2001 and subsequently refurbished in 2019, now faces an extensive investigation to pinpoint the exact cause of the explosion. While the inquiry remains ongoing, American Queen Voyages released a statement addressing the event: “Ocean Navigator encountered a generator fire this morning in Portland, ME. Thankfully, no passengers were harmed. Due to our crew’s rapid response, everyone was evacuated safely. One crew member, unfortunately, sustained injuries and is under medical care.

A trusted source revealed on Wednesday that Biden is considering $60 billion in aid for Ukraine and an additional $10 billion for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation behind this potential aid stems from recent international incidents. Israel, on one side, is recovering from the October 7 attack led by Hamas militants. On the other, Ukraine continues to confront the challenges posed by a Russian invasion. The U.S., as a longstanding supporter of both nations, seeks to bolster their positions during these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Biden’s commitment to these allies is evident, he is also believed to be exploring a broader supplemental request of approximately $100 billion. This would not only fortify Israel and Ukraine but also extend defense aid to Taiwan. Moreover, part of this funding aims to enhance security measures along the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Jim Risch, a leading Republican voice on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed unfamiliarity with the $100 billion figure outside of news coverage. However, he acknowledged hearing rumors of the administration’s $10 billion consideration for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, it remains uncertain what the final figures will look like, as Biden has yet to settle on definitive numbers. Furthermore, the administration has not shared a detailed breakdown with Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s crucial to note that, under U.S. legislation, Congress holds the purse strings and controls expenditures, not the executive branch. This means that, irrespective of Biden’s proposals, Congress will have the final say on the distribution of these funds.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it’s crucial to note that, under U.S. legislation, Congress holds the purse strings and controls expenditures, not the executive branch. This means that, irrespective of Biden’s proposals, Congress will have the final say on the distribution of these funds. As the world watches closely, the forthcoming days will shed more light on how the U.S. plans to back its allies in their hour of need and the role Congress will play in these pivotal decisions.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden’s Controversial Move with Labor Secretary Ignites GOP Firestorm</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/19/Biden-Decision-Labor-Secretary/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden’s Controversial Move with Labor Secretary Ignites GOP Firestorm" /><published>2023-10-19T14:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T14:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/19/Biden-Decision-Labor-Secretary</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/19/Biden-Decision-Labor-Secretary/">&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration faces growing criticism after its decision to include Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su in the presidential line of succession. This move has sparked significant backlash, particularly as Su’s nomination for the role has yet to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alabama GOP Sen. Katie Britt spearheaded a letter, signed by 29 Republican Senate colleagues, addressed to President Biden. The letter voices their “grave concerns” and seeks clarification about Su’s eligibility to potentially assume the office of the President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senators highlighted that since March 14, 2023, Ms. Su’s nomination has not been confirmed, pointing out a lack of bipartisan support for her position. The White House, however, continues to recognize her as Acting Secretary of Labor and has included her name on its official website in the “order of succession to the Presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su, who served as California’s labor secretary from 2019 to 2021 under Gov. Gavin Newsom, is currently ninth in line for the presidency. The GOP senators have called out the administration for potentially disregarding congressional intent, stating it would be “antithetical to our system of governance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senators’ concerns also touch on the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress the authority to set the presidential line of succession beyond the Vice President. The letter further emphasizes that Ms. Su has not been “appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,” urging the administration to clarify its stance on her position in the line of succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a direct quote from the letter, the senators wrote, “It is unimaginable to think that this Administration believes someone who has neither been duly elected nor confirmed by the Senate… could be President of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the ongoing controversy surrounding her place in the line of succession, Su’s nomination has faced considerable challenges from both sides of the aisle. While she has been serving as acting secretary since Marty Walsh’s resignation earlier this year, her official confirmation remains uncertain. Su’s nomination saw intense pushback due to her stance on gig work regulations in California and her perceived lack of cooperation with ICE officials during her tenure as the state’s top labor official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOP senators have reiterated their call for President Biden to reconsider Su’s nomination, suggesting he put forward a nominee capable of garnering bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both parties voicing concerns over Su’s nomination, this situation serves as another flashpoint in the already tense relationship between the Biden administration and Senate Republicans. The resolution to this debate will likely have significant implications for the administration’s relations with Congress and its ability to navigate future political challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden administration faces growing criticism after its decision to include Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su in the presidential line of succession.

One of the most shocking revelations from the excerpts released on Tuesday is the disclosure of her abortion during her relationship with pop icon Justin Timberlake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spears candidly writes, “If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,” referring to the abortion. She further elaborates, sharing that Timberlake “was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.” This personal revelation is set to provide readers with an intimate look into the singer’s private struggles and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their whirlwind romance began when both Spears and Timberlake were young performers on Disney’s Mickey Mouse Club. The duo later started dating in their late teens, swiftly becoming the talk of Tinseltown and one of the most-watched couples in the entertainment arena. Their high-profile relationship ended in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Baby One More Time” singer recalls Timberlake’s reaction to her pregnancy, sharing he “definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy.” Spears adds, “He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.” The heartbreak and emotional turmoil from the abortion are evident in her words, as she describes it as “one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britney’s memoir doesn’t stop at her relationship with Timberlake. She dives deep into the controversial conservatorship that dominated her life for 14 years. Under this legal guardianship, she felt her autonomy stripped away. Spears recalls the conservatorship’s control over even her reproductive rights, sharing that she was prevented from removing a contraceptive IUD despite wanting another child. “The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child,” Spears remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the extended period of control her father and his associates had over her personal and financial affairs, Spears writes, “I think back now… and it makes me feel sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pop sensation’s memoir is also expected to touch upon her personal life after Timberlake. Spears had two sons with her second husband, Kevin Federline. Following a very public breakdown in 2008, Spears entered into the previously mentioned conservatorship led by her father, Jamie. Fortunately, this conservatorship came to an end in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, life hasn’t been entirely rosy for the star since. In 2022, she announced a miscarriage and later, in August, her third husband, Sam Asghari, stated they were filing for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

The poll, which took place between October 11th and 15th, paints a detailed picture of Americans’ political and economic sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s approval ratings have seen a downturn, with only 37% of Americans showing approval and 58% expressing disapproval. This marks a concerning period for the Biden administration, having the second-lowest approval and second-highest disapproval during his tenure. Particularly concerning for Biden is his approval rating on economic matters, which stands at a mere 32% against a 63% disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, amidst the political tussles, a notable highlight from the survey is the strong American support for Israel. In the aftermath of recent attacks by Hamas on Israel, a whopping 74% of respondents believed it’s crucial for the U.S. to continue providing military aid to Israel. This backing for Israel’s military assistance surpasses support for several other key issues, including securing the U.S.-Mexico border, foreign humanitarian aid at 72%, and military assistance to Ukraine at 61%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Biden’s swift show of support for Israel and promises of additional aid during the conflict did not earn him much favor. Only 31% approved of his handling of foreign policy, and a significant 60% disapproved. Interestingly, this decline isn’t limited to the opposition. Within the Democratic party, Biden’s foreign policy decisions are approved by just 66% of members, and 74% support his economic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also highlights the polarization in the American political landscape. Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, 57% of Republicans lean toward supporting Israelis, in contrast to 29% of Democrats and 27% of independents. Meanwhile, a significant chunk of Democrats (44%) and independents (47%) favor a balanced stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intriguing insight from this study is a shift in sentiment when comparing current data with a 2014 survey. Older Americans, especially those above 35, are now more in favor of supporting Israel than before. Young Americans, aged 18 to 34, seem more inclined towards a neutral stance, with 46% believing both sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict should be treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of government funding priorities, the survey indicated clear party-line preferences. Republicans and independents showed a leaning towards securing the U.S.-Mexico border and then military funding for Israel. Democrats, however, placed military aid for Ukraine and foreign humanitarian aid at the top of their list.&lt;/p&gt;
