A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Musk’s X/Twitter Delves into ID-Based Verification - Joining Hands with Israeli Tech Firm</title><link href="/news/2023/09/16/X-Twitter-Verification/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Musk’s X/Twitter Delves into ID-Based Verification - Joining Hands with Israeli Tech Firm" /><published>2023-09-16T11:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-16T11:08:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/16/X-Twitter-Verification</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/16/X-Twitter-Verification/">&lt;p&gt;In a push for enhanced security and to combat impersonation, Elon Musk’s revolutionary social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), has rolled out a trailblazing feature. This novel development permits its premium subscribers to verify their profiles using government-issued identity cards, courtesy of a collaboration with the Israel-based identity verification stalwart, Au10tix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, European subscribers, including those in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, find themselves on the outside looking in. The stringent data protection statutes in these territories are the likely culprits behind their exclusion from this innovative offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s venture elucidated its rationale behind this feature, highlighting its dedication to authentication for the prevention of impersonation. Additionally, Musk’s platform aims to provide its users with age-appropriate content and fend off the threats of spam and malicious accounts. Thus, ensuring the platform remains a bastion of healthy discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct pop-up will be at the forefront of this verification journey, indicating that Au10tix could retain the user’s personal data for a span extending to 30 days. Upon successful verification, a noteworthy acknowledgment will grace their profile. This acknowledgment, symbolized by a verified blue checkmark, will be the beacon of assurance for fellow users, signifying the authenticity of the profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a carrot for those opting for this verification. They stand to gain “prioritized support from X Services.” Nevertheless, the exact nature of this privileged support is shrouded in ambiguity. Some detractors have voiced their skepticism, terming the ID-based verification as a redundant exercise, seemingly yielding minimal advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tandem with this announcement, X/Twitter divulged its roadmap to streamline the review process for its verified accounts. A further perk for these verified aficionados is the liberty to frequently revamp their names, display pictures, or even their usernames, without the peril of surrendering their coveted verified status. But herein lies a catch - this luxury is the preserve of the paying clientele, triggering debates about its universality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid chat with Bloomberg, X/Twitter illuminated its overarching goal with this venture. The company aims to link, for those who so desire, their accounts to tangible identities, by leveraging their official IDs. The ulterior motive is to fortify the platform’s defenses against impersonation, thereby elevating its security quotient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unveiling is a stark contrast from the platform’s move a few months prior, where it phased out its traditional verification program. This abrupt shift, leading to the removal of verification badges, stirred a tempest among its user community. The ensuing tumult forced the company’s hand, culminating in the restoration of the coveted verification checkmark for its marquee users.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a push for enhanced security and to combat impersonation, Elon Musk’s revolutionary social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), has rolled out a trailblazing feature.

Being at the helm of America’s favorite quiz show is no small task, and Bialik’s journey has been an intriguing blend of praise, criticism, and self-growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigating-the-challenges&quot;&gt;Navigating the Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bialik has been under the microscope, with some fans dissecting her every move, expression, and hosting style. This was highlighted in the recent “Inside Jeopardy!” podcast episode where producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss discussed Mayim’s reactions to contestants’ answers. Bialik had openly shared her amazement at contestants’ swift recall abilities, often expressing her astonishment when they got things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her genuine surprise was endearing to some, it became a point of contention for others, including the show’s producer. As Whitcomb Foss suggested, maintaining the pace and flow of the show was paramount, stating, “Yes, correct, you got it” should suffice as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixed-fan-reactions&quot;&gt;Mixed Fan Reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the critiques from behind-the-scenes, fans have voiced their own set of concerns. Many lamented her taking extra moments after contestant responses, potentially stemming from her habit of being impressed by the contestants. Additionally, perceived inconsistency in rulings earned her some flak, with claims of being too strict in her judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s noteworthy to mention the contrast in hosting styles between Bialik, a seasoned actress, and Jennings, an iconic “Jeopardy!” player. This dynamic has led to divided fan opinions, with Jennings seemingly getting the edge for some as Bialik steps back in support of the writers’ strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-the-executive-desk&quot;&gt;From the Executive Desk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the turbulence in fans’ reactions, executive producer Michael Davies expressed the challenges of hosting “Jeopardy!” and emphasized the uniqueness each host brings.

Amongst the most anxious are Biden’s aides, who are reportedly feeling the heat from recent polls suggesting a neck-to-neck race between the two former contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gravity of Trump’s Threat&lt;/strong&gt;
CNN recently reported that the prospect of Trump returning as the Republican candidate is causing “existential stress” within the Biden camp. While Trump’s known controversial nature might make him seem like an easier opponent to some, Biden’s aides are gravely concerned. They fear that any slip-ups by the Biden campaign, or unanticipated missteps by Biden himself, could potentially see Trump return to the White House, a scenario they view as detrimental to American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Media’s Pressure on Biden&lt;/strong&gt;
The pressure isn’t solely stemming from the possibility of a Trump comeback. Liberal media outlets and respected columnists have lately turned their scrutiny onto the Biden administration. A recent piece by David Ignatius from The Washington Post called on Biden and Vice President Harris to reconsider their 2024 run, expressing concerns that their campaign could jeopardize the progress made since Trump’s defeat in the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaign Woes and Media Scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;
To add to the worries, Biden’s campaign is experiencing a noticeable absence of notable names and big checkbooks from the Democratic donor community. Aides are pointing fingers at the media, accusing them of amplifying concerns about Biden’s age and the controversies surrounding his son, Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent polls don’t help alleviate these anxieties. A significant portion of the American populace, including many from the Democratic base, have voiced concerns about Biden’s age, given he would be 86 at the end of a second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing the Future&lt;/strong&gt;
As the potential for a historic rematch between Biden and Trump becomes increasingly plausible, the Biden camp must navigate their internal apprehensions and the external pressures of the media, polls, and public opinion. The stage is set for a tumultuous run-up to 2024, with the shadows of the past election looming large.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The political landscape is buzzing with whispers of a potential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2024.

This penalty marks the maiden time TikTok has faced repercussions under Europe’s stringent data privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of Big Tech companies have their European headquarters situated in Dublin. It is here that Ireland’s Data Protection Commission decreed the fine of 345 million euros. TikTok is under fire for transgressions stemming from the latter half of 2020, primarily concerning the default settings of the accounts for teenagers. These default configurations left the accounts public, enabling unrestricted access to and commentary on their videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the “family pairing” feature, intended to allow parental oversight, had a loophole. This laxity permitted adults to activate direct messaging for users within the age bracket of 16 and 17, bypassing their consent. Moreover, TikTok reportedly nudged its younger demographic towards selecting more “privacy intrusive” alternatives during their sign-up and content upload procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TikTok has rebuffed the ruling, particularly balking at the quantum of the fine, they have indicated that most of the grievances addressed by the regulatory body were outdated. The platform underscored its proactive measures, such as making accounts of those under 16 private by default and deactivating direct messaging capabilities for the 13 to 15 age group, initiated well before the inquiry’s commencement in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these arguments, it’s evident that the European Union is taking a stand, with Brussels now stepping up to the plate to ensure stricter regulations and curb missteps in the digital realm. The essence is to retain its vanguard position in the sphere of tech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the onus of social media firms is crystal clear. They need to present options without bias, especially to the younger generation, to ensure the preservation of their privacy rights. Data privacy is an ongoing global concern, with TikTok’s data sharing with China adding another layer of complexity. The European community’s reservations regarding the potential for sensitive user information making its way to China have led TikTok to establish a data center in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broader panorama, other tech behemoths like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta have faced the music in Europe, indicating the continent’s no-nonsense approach to data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

During a recent speech, Biden seemed to link “African Americans and Hispanic workers” with individuals “without high school diplomas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Discrepancy in Words&lt;/strong&gt;
During his speech at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Md., President Biden remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, the workers without high school diplomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the White House’s transcript tells a slightly different story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment, particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, and the workers without high-school diplomas. The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for women now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that there’s a discrepancy between what Biden said and how the White House chose to transcribe it. The altered version seems to create more distance between minority communities and those without high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s important to put Biden’s comments into context. Over the years, he’s made several controversial remarks, leading some to label them as instances of ‘ignorant racism’. Among these, he referred to “poor kids” being “just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” and also described former President Barack Obama as “bright and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a history of questionable statements, this latest incident has further ignited debates about the President’s perspectives on race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussions around systemic racism and inequality continue to dominate the global narrative, leaders are expected to choose their words wisely, setting a tone of inclusivity and understanding. It remains to be seen whether this latest incident will be brushed under the rug or lead to broader conversations about the inherent biases that might still exist at the highest levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a week already rife with political tension, President Joe Biden added fuel to the fire with a statement that has left many outraged.

This week, the legal skirmish reached its conclusion, but not without a few cliffhangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;superheros-tumultuous-last-days&quot;&gt;Superhero’s Tumultuous Last Days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before his death on November 12, 2018, Stan Lee had been the central figure in an elder abuse lawsuit. The suit accused his ex-business manager, Jerardo Olivarez, of siphoning a whopping $1.4 million from Lee’s accounts. Later, Uri Litvak, an attorney associated with Olivarez, found himself added to the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations trace back to the dynamic between the two defendants. Olivarez introduced Litvak to Lee, pressuring the comic legend to retain the latter’s legal services for his business endeavors. The resulting relationship, according to the complaint filed in 2018, led to significant financial losses for Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continuing-the-fight&quot;&gt;Continuing The Fight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Stan Lee’s passing, his daughter, Joan Lee, took on the mantle of the case as a trustee of his estate. The recent judgment brought a twist when the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled in favor of Litvak. The crux of the decision rested on the fact that the statute of limitations had expired by a mere five days when the case against Litvak was initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lee estate fervently argued that Litvak’s professional interactions with the Marvel creator had extended beyond the lawsuit’s initial filing date, potentially halting the statute of limitations. However, arbitrator David Brickner cited evidence in the form of a letter from Lee in 2017, clarifying that Litvak’s services had been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-of-an-era&quot;&gt;End Of An Era&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conclusion draws the curtain on the legal battles that clouded Stan Lee’s final years. The legendary creator of superheroes such as Iron Man, Hulk, Spider-Man, and Thor faced personal battles that drew as much attention as his comic world exploits. These included conflicts with his daughter Joan, allegations against her for elder abuse, and accusations against former associates out for his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as with most superhero tales, the story eventually found its resolution. The Marvel maestro, despite the shadows cast by these controversies, ultimately sided with his daughter. Their bond, it seems, was stronger than any adversarial plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stan Lee’s legacy in the comic book realm is unmatched, having shaped the industry since 1939. And though the recent years saw him grappling with personal challenges, from health issues to the loss of his wife of nearly 70 years in 2017, his contribution to the world of comics and entertainment remains unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of this lawsuit may be seen by many as the final chapter in the storied life of a man who taught generations to dream, hope, and always fight for justice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The enthralling world of superheroes often pits the forces of good against the sinister plots of villains.

&lt;p&gt;In an engaging discussion on FNC’s “Jesse Watters Primetime”, Ramaswamy posited that Biden, despite being the face of the Democratic Party, might soon be maneuvered “out of the way” by his very own political allies. Lending weight to this assertion, he hinted at a larger play at hand, labeling Biden as a potential “sacrificial lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Watters, noting the fluctuating poll numbers and evident tension within the Democratic camp, probed Ramaswamy for his take. “Joe Biden, not looking so good,” Watters began, “how are things looking to you as a Republican?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramaswamy, never one to mince his words, confidently stated, “I was happy to see that I’m beating Joe Biden in that poll and doing just fine.” However, it was his subsequent remarks that raised eyebrows. Diving into the heart of the matter, he contended, “Joe Biden is a puppet for the managerial class… he’s a figurehead for the deep state and the managerial class.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such statements, while audacious, frame the current state of U.S. politics in a new light. Ramaswamy’s observations suggest that there might be more to Biden’s presidency than what meets the eye. He believes that if Biden’s use reaches its end, the powers that be will merely “trot out the next puppet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer of intrigue, he referred to the recent indictment involving Hunter Biden, calling it a potential “smokescreen” and hinting at its use to edge Joe Biden out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramaswamy’s revelations, if accurate, depict a complicated and evolving political gameboard, with strategies and ploys going well beyond traditional party lines. As the countdown to the 2024 election begins, one can only anticipate more political drama to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the 2024 elections loom, the political landscape appears to be in flux, with GOP hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy making a startling prediction regarding the fate of current President Joe Biden.

Following an incident involving an aggressive, reportedly intoxicated roommate, Izquierdo found herself facing serious legal consequences for defending herself. Her story and the subsequent courtroom drama serve as a powerful testament to the Second Amendment’s enduring importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-birthday-in-jail-to-second-amendment-triumph&quot;&gt;From Birthday in Jail to Second Amendment Triumph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating her birthday behind bars last year was perhaps the least of Izquierdo’s worries. After using her firearm to fend off an allegedly aggressive male roommate in San Bernardino, California, she was arrested. A year on, her case has been dismissed, highlighting the crucial role the Second Amendment played in ensuring her safety from unforeseen dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening in question, Izquierdo had completed household chores and was ready to wind down when the male roommate returned home. She believed he was drunk and was neither in the mood nor felt safe to engage in a conversation with him. What followed was a distressing sequence of events that saw the man persistently approach her, to the point where Izquierdo feared for her safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-turn-of-events&quot;&gt;A Turn of Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izquierdo’s attempts to avoid confrontation proved fruitless. When she tried to shut herself inside a bathroom to elude him, the situation took a frightening turn. The man blocked the door, confirming Izquierdo’s fears that a dangerous confrontation was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, California law permits residents to carry guns on private property without a permit. Equipped with a concealed carry permit and her association with the U.S. Concealed Carry Association, Izquierdo managed to retrieve her gun in the nick of time. Her decisive action kept her safe, but she was arrested and charged following the altercation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-triumph-and-second-amendment-advocacy&quot;&gt;Legal Triumph and Second Amendment Advocacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending nearly three weeks in jail, Izquierdo recalled her membership with the U.S. Concealed Carry Association, which offers self-defense liability insurance. With the help of her legal team, including attorney Andy Beltran, it was demonstrated that she acted in self-defense. The persistent efforts of her defense team, coupled with the backing of the USCCA, led to her eventual exoneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beltran’s advice post the trial was poignant: “Refrain from making any statements to the police even if you think you are in the right.” This case underscores how situations can swiftly turn and the importance of being knowledgeable about one’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further emphasizing the relevance of being prepared, Jake Schmidt from the USCCA mentioned, “Responsible gun owners need to be mentally, physically and legally prepared for a self-defense incident. All USCCA members receive lifesaving education and training, plus self-defense liability insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-immigrants-perspective&quot;&gt;An Immigrant’s Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izquierdo’s experience as an immigrant from Cuba gave her unique insight into the significance of personal freedoms. Coming from a country where individual liberties were curtailed, she expressed gratitude for the rights afforded to her in the U.S. Despite the challenges of her arrest, Izquierdo showcased resilience and tenacity, highlighting, “Being prepared is not just carrying a weapon only… I am very happy that I made the right decision to have these lawyers and to have this [USCCA] insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This landmark case not only affirms the rights of responsible gun owners but also illuminates the broader implications of the Second Amendment in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a recent legal win, Maybi Izquierdo, a female long-haul trucker, reignites the national debate on the Second Amendment and the rights of gun owners.

This follows charges in late July that alleged Trump and two of his employees tried to delete footage from his Florida estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid conversation with “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, Trump categorically labeled the allegations against him as “false”. Emphasizing his point, when quizzed about his willingness to testify under oath, Trump didn’t flinch, asserting, “Sure, I’m going to — I’ll testify.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant revelation from Trump highlighted that the tapes in question were never deleted. “But more importantly, the tapes weren’t deleted. In other words, there was nothing done to them. And they were my tapes. I could have fought them. I didn’t even have to give them the tapes, I don’t think,” Trump emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet, and Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance supervisor at Mar-a-Lago, have both been charged with obstruction, Trump has consistently maintained a clean slate. Prosecutors allege that the two, following a subpoena, instructed an unnamed staffer to delete the tapes, claiming that “the boss” had made the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s steadfast claim to innocence doesn’t stop with the tapes. The former President faces multiple trials, yet he remains undeterred, stating he’s done nothing wrong. Addressing the possibility of a self-pardon should he win the 2024 general election, Trump told NBC, “What, what did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything wrong. You mean, because I challenge an election, they want to put me in jail?”&lt;/p&gt;
