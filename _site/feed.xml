A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Breakthrough Arrest in Tupac’s 1996 Murder</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/30/Breakthrough-Tupac-Murder/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Breakthrough Arrest in Tupac’s 1996 Murder" /><published>2023-09-30T17:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-30T17:01:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/30/Breakthrough-Tupac-Murder</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/30/Breakthrough-Tupac-Murder/">&lt;p&gt;After years of mysterious silence and speculation, a major breakthrough occurs in the notorious 1996 murder case of iconic rapper Tupac Shakur. Duane “Keffe D” Davis, the only surviving witness, has been indicted in connection with the murder. This news reignites the legacy of Tupac, shedding new light on his untimely demise and leaving fans and followers both stunned and vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shocking-arrest&quot;&gt;Shocking Arrest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Davis, also known as “Keffe D,” was arrested near his home, leading to shockwaves across the music industry and fans globally. The indictment on the charge of open murder, with the use of a deadly weapon along with a gang enhancement, reveals the layers and depths to this case that have kept it unresolved for decades. The pivotal arrest occurred as Davis, 60, was on a walk, leaving the public in anticipation for what’s next in this twist-filled saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revelations-from-the-past&quot;&gt;Revelations from the Past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis had long been on the radar of investigators. He admitted in his 2019 tell-all memoir, “Compton Street Legend,” that he was present in the Cadillac during the infamous September 1996 drive-by shooting that led to Tupac’s death. Davis’s admissions, along with his media statements, have reinvigorated the investigation, giving hope to those who seek justice for Tupac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legacy-continues&quot;&gt;Legacy Continues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his untimely death at just 25, Tupac Shakur remains one of the most influential figures in the hip-hop community. His fourth solo record, “All Eyez on Me,” was topping the charts at the time of his death, with about 5 million copies sold. Tupac’s enduring influence and the continuous love from fans show the undying nature of his artistry and his impact on the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gang-connections-and-controversies&quot;&gt;Gang Connections and Controversies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gang connections in this case have always fueled controversies and theories regarding Tupac’s murder. Davis claimed in an interview that everyone present in the Cadillac on the night of the murder was a member of the South Side Compton Crips gang. This gang was reportedly on the lookout for Tupac, who had allegedly brawled with a member in the hours leading up to his fatal shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evidence-seizure-and-further-investigations&quot;&gt;Evidence Seizure and Further Investigations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities have seized multiple items from Davis’s residence, including electronic devices and copies of “Compton Street Legends,” in the hope of finding more clues and information pertaining to Tupac’s murder. The evidence seized during the raid corroborates information previously collected during the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-on-fans-and-the-industry&quot;&gt;The Impact on Fans and the Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indictment has reignited discussions and reflections on Tupac’s life and his contribution to music and culture. Fans, music aficionados, and industry peers are closely watching the developments, seeking closure to one of the most painful and iconic moments in music history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this case are vast, impacting not just the music industry, but also reflecting on the societal and cultural dimensions of the 1990s, offering a closer look into the life and struggles of one of the most impactful artists of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough is a reminder of the enduring influence of Tupac Shakur, and the quest for truth and justice in his case represents the collective hope to preserve and honor his legacy.

This extraordinary breach has provoked a strong reaction, with officials emphasizing the sanctity of taxpayer information and the necessity of stringent security protocols to avoid such disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn, 38, residing in Washington, D.C., is accused of disclosing tax returns of some of the wealthiest individuals in the nation, reaching thousands in number. These documents were relayed to various news media outlets and even reached ProPublica, laden with tax information related to a high-ranking government official. All this occurred while Littlejohn was operating as a government contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-charges-and-their-implications&quot;&gt;The Charges and Their Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn is facing a serious charge of unauthorized disclosure of tax returns and return information. If he’s convicted, he’s staring at a potential maximum penalty of a five-year prison term. These charges were brought forward as a criminal information instead of an indictment, implying the possibility of Littlejohn having entered a plea deal.

The RHSA brings forth the promise of a law that is both constitutional and democratic, establishing an interstate compact to create uniform rules governing medication control and racetrack safety in horse racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-closed-doors---hisas-unpopularity&quot;&gt;Behind Closed Doors - HISA’s Unpopularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act (HISA) is marred by secrecy and lack of consensus from the industry players. Its implementation, according to many, threatens to oust small businesses from the horseracing industry by burdening them with $66 million in regulatory costs. This act, despite its avowed goal to enact nationwide rules for racetrack safety and anti-doping, has met with substantial disapproval for its heavy-handed approach and alleged unconstitutionality, which is seen as giving federal power to a private entity without adequate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-rhsa---a-beacon-of-reform&quot;&gt;The Rise of RHSA - A Beacon of Reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to HISA’s perceived failures, Republican attorneys general have thrown their support behind the Racehorse Health and Safety Act (RHSA), proposed by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA). The RHSA promises to be more inclusive, allowing contributions from various industry entities, focusing on established scientific principles and methodologies. Advocates believe that this act will be significantly less costly as it plans to utilize existing state resources, enabling states to either enforce RHSO rules or allow RHSO to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-of-principles---science-vs-public-perception&quot;&gt;A Battle of Principles - Science vs Public Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical difference between HISA and RHSA lies in their foundational principles. The former is perceived to have rules grounded more in public perception, which failed to prevent numerous racehorse deaths at Churchill Downs, while the latter promises to base its rules on generally accepted scientific principles, focusing on the health and welfare of racehorses. The support for RHSA from entities like the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and the United States Trotting Association reinforces its commitment to sound veterinary science and industry inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate, is reportedly set to exit the Democratic primary to pursue a run for president as an Independent. This major political pivot is expected to be announced officially on October 9 in Pennsylvania. The revelation surfaces amidst speculations and concerns within the Democratic party about the potential ramifications of such a move, particularly regarding its impact on President Joe Biden’s voter base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kennedys-bold-move&quot;&gt;Kennedy’s Bold Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s reported departure from the Democrat primary has raised eyebrows and set the political sphere abuzz, considering the possible shifts in voter preferences and party allegiances this might induce. According to reports, Kennedy’s campaign will also launch attack ads against the Democrat National Committee (DNC) to smooth the transition for his announcement, highlighting the rising tensions within the party factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-clash-with-dnc&quot;&gt;The Clash with DNC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s planned independent run seems to emanate from his increasing disillusionment with the DNC, claiming that the committee is altering the rules to sideline his candidacy. Kennedy has been vocally critical of the DNC’s strategies and has accused them of blocking his participation in the political process, laying bare the internal conflicts and power struggles within the party. This assertion aligns with his public remarks made earlier this month, stressing his commitment to keeping all options open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-major-announcement&quot;&gt;The Major Announcement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s upcoming announcement in Philadelphia is expected to draw significant attention, given its potential implications on the political landscape. He has kept the details of the announcement under wraps but has assured that it will delineate his path to the White House and discuss avenues for national healing. Kennedy’s move to an independent candidacy is poised to challenge the established norms and rewrite the narratives of American politics, pointing towards an intensified battle for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible defection of Kennedy to an independent run is causing unease among Democrat operatives, fearing that it would dilute Biden’s base by drawing votes away from him. Third Way cofounder Matt Bennett expressed concerns over third parties in close elections, emphasizing that they can be perilous and detrimental to the incumbent president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aligning-with-libertarians&quot;&gt;Aligning with Libertarians?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s political maneuvers have also been marked by his interactions with Libertarian Party chair Angela McArdle. Despite his declared commitment to running as a Democrat, he has identified with many libertarian viewpoints, revealing a convergence on various issues, including concerns about the “deep state.” This alignment opens the door to potential collaborations and support from varied political spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anticipated move to an independent run is a testament to the evolving and unpredictable nature of the current political terrain. With emerging alliances and shifting allegiances, the upcoming announcement is set to redefine political alignments and could potentially recalibrate the race to the White House, signaling a tumultuous journey ahead in the American political saga.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate, is reportedly set to exit the Democratic primary to pursue a run for president as an Independent. This major political pivot is expected to be announced officially on October 9 in Pennsylvania. The revelation surfaces amidst speculations and concerns within the Democratic party about the potential ramifications of such a move, particularly regarding its impact on President Joe Biden’s voter base. Kennedy’s Bold Move Kennedy’s reported departure from the Democrat primary has raised eyebrows and set the political sphere abuzz, considering the possible shifts in voter preferences and party allegiances this might induce. According to reports, Kennedy’s campaign will also launch attack ads against the Democrat National Committee (DNC) to smooth the transition for his announcement, highlighting the rising tensions within the party factions. The Clash with DNC Kennedy’s planned independent run seems to emanate from his increasing disillusionment with the DNC, claiming that the committee is altering the rules to sideline his candidacy. Kennedy has been vocally critical of the DNC’s strategies and has accused them of blocking his participation in the political process, laying bare the internal conflicts and power struggles within the party. This assertion aligns with his public remarks made earlier this month, stressing his commitment to keeping all options open.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-fun-outing-turns-fatal&quot;&gt;A Fun Outing Turns Fatal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollis had reportedly enjoyed a single margarita with her husky, Tequila, at a dog-friendly bar, Mutts Canine Cantina, before getting behind the wheel. She admitted to police that she ran a red light, colliding with the car driven by Southern Methodist University sophomore, Honor Elizabeth Wallace, leading to Wallace’s untimely demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;victim-left-to-be-mourned&quot;&gt;Victim Left to be Mourned&lt;/h2&gt;

The university and its community expressed their deep sadness and condolences over the tragic loss of a valued member of their community, a young life full of potential cut short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lingering-effects-of-the-crash&quot;&gt;Lingering Effects of the Crash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollis, who showed signs of intoxication, such as glassy eyes and slurred speech, at the time of her arrest, is charged with intoxication manslaughter and intoxication assault. She was released on a $100,000 bond. The incident and subsequent charges highlight the lasting and far-reaching consequences of impaired driving, with a moment’s indiscretion leading to irreversible damage.&lt;/p&gt;

This surge intensifies the anticipation surrounding potential candidates in the upcoming elections, with Trump now commanding a 51-point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-gaining-momentum&quot;&gt;Trump’s Gaining Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two days before the debate, a Morning Consult’s poll revealed 58% support for Trump. Intriguingly, his absence from the debate didn’t deter his supporters. Post-debate, his backing surged to 63%, implying that his political maneuvers and strategies continue to resonate with a substantial segment of the GOP electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desantis-faces-setback&quot;&gt;DeSantis Faces Setback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, DeSantis experienced a fall in the polls, dropping three points to 12%, a significant decline from his 15% on Monday. The sizable shift from Monday to Thursday, as highlighted by Morning Consult, is particularly noteworthy, considering there was no significant change in GOP electorate’s views after the first Republican debate in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-overall-gop-landscape&quot;&gt;The Overall GOP Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivek Ramaswamy also saw a decline, losing two points and resting at seven percent support post-debate. No other candidate in the fray managed to poll higher than five percent. The fluctuating support percentages reflect the ongoing dynamism and unpredictability within the GOP, emphasizing the need for candidates to refine their approaches and connect more effectively with the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;declining-viewership&quot;&gt;Declining Viewership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second GOP debate marked a 26% drop in viewership compared to the first, attracting less than 10 million viewers according to Nielsen ratings. Trump’s deliberate avoidance of the debates, owing to his substantial lead in the polls, has potentially contributed to this reduced interest among viewers, underscoring his pivotal role in drawing public attention to GOP events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-alternative-engagement&quot;&gt;Trump’s Alternative Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opting out of the debate, Trump chose to address striking autoworkers in Michigan instead, demonstrating his knack for tapping into populist sentiments and maintaining a direct connection with his base, irrespective of the formal political stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant shift in support towards Trump and away from DeSantis post-debate underscores the former President’s enduring impact on the Republican voter base. The continued shifts and realignments within GOP supporter preferences point to an evolving political landscape, where absence seems to make the heart grow fonder, at least in the case of Donald Trump. The unfolding scenario also raises questions about the effectiveness of debates in altering voter preferences and the broader implications for GOP dynamics moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump appears to be strengthening his political influence, witnessing a remarkable 8-point swing in support among likely Republican primary voters, following the second GOP debate on Wednesday night, a debate he did not attend.

Despite being acquitted of malicious wounding, Colie remains incarcerated, facing a lesser gun charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-prank-turns-serious&quot;&gt;A Prank Turns Serious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner Cook, a 21-year-old YouTube content creator known as “Classified Goons,” attempted to pull a prank on Colie on April 2. Cook, who earns approximately $2,000 to $3,000 a month from his videos, typically follows people around in public places and acts bizarrely. However, this prank escalated quickly when he confronted Colie at the Dulles Center Mall near Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-confrontation&quot;&gt;The Confrontation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook blasted a phrase in Colie’s face and followed him persistently, leading Colie to pull out a gun and shoot him in the chest in self-defense. Cook survived and shared the video of the shooting’s aftermath with his 55,000 YouTube followers under the title, “I Got Shot!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colie pleaded not guilty, arguing that the shooting was in self-defense, and jurors agreed to an extent, acquitting him of the most severe charges, including aggravated malicious wounding and malicious shooting inside an occupied building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legal-tangle&quot;&gt;Legal Tangle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the acquittal on serious charges, Colie was found guilty of using a firearm during the commission of a felony, leaving him behind bars. Colie’s lawyers are moving against this, claiming that the conviction is inconsistent with Virginia law, especially considering the jurors’ acknowledgment of Colie acting without malice and in self-defense. He is due back in court on Oct. 19 for a hearing on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pranks-and-consequences&quot;&gt;Pranks and Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident raises questions about the consequences of pranks and whether the quest for views and followers is pushing content creators too far, causing irreversible harm and life-changing consequences. Cook, who continues to create videos, confessed he had no idea his prank had scared or angered Colie to the extent it did, highlighting the lack of foresight and the potential dangers involved in these public pranks.&lt;/p&gt;

The procedural vote to progress the bill had earlier been successful, but the final vote hit a wall, with 198 to 232 members opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uncommon-alliances-and-strained-relations&quot;&gt;Uncommon Alliances and Strained Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one Republicans, including high-profile names like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Nancy Mace, sided with the Democrats to tank the bill. This maneuvering dealt a severe blow to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who’s been juggling disagreements within his conference throughout this spending battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-ticking-clock&quot;&gt;A Ticking Clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With federal government funding expiring at the end of the day on September 30, the inability of the House and Senate to agree on a deal threatens to bring “nonessential” federal functions to a standstill. A temporary funding extension is desperately needed to allow lawmakers more time to consolidate individual spending bills for the fiscal year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conservative-standpoint&quot;&gt;The Conservative Standpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservatives are resisting any short-term funding extension, asserting it would simply prolong the influence of the previous Democratically controlled Congress. They’ve been particularly vocal about their objections to proposals that do not align with conservative policy, leading to intensified debates on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-maneuvering-and-accusations&quot;&gt;Political Maneuvering and Accusations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy and his allies have been trying to sway the dissenters, accusing them of empowering Democrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the White House. They argue that siding with Democrats gives the opposing party more leverage to pass government funding without incorporating conservative policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discord-and-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Discord and Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ongoing discord within the Republican party and between major political parties is causing uncertainty and pushing the government ever closer to a shutdown. A government closure seems increasingly likely, with no consensus on a short-term spending patch in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;senates-countermove&quot;&gt;Senate’s Countermove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Senate is formulating its own funding extension, planning to maintain current funding levels for 45 days while also allocating additional aid for Ukraine and U.S. disaster relief. However, McCarthy remains adamant about not introducing a short-term spending bill that includes Ukraine funding to the floor unless it also encompasses border security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fallout&quot;&gt;The Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent rebellion and the subsequent clash between GOP rebels and Democrats underscore the current volatile state of American politics. If a resolution is not reached promptly, essential government functions risk being paralyzed, affecting millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadlock over the government funding bill illustrates the deep-seated divisions and ideological clashes within and between the major political parties.
