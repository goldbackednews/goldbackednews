A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">RFK Jr.’s Warning - Is the DNC Trying to Silence Opposition?</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/12/DNC-RFK-Campaign/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RFK Jr.’s Warning - Is the DNC Trying to Silence Opposition?" /><published>2023-09-12T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-12T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/12/DNC-RFK-Campaign</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/12/DNC-RFK-Campaign/">&lt;p&gt;The road to the 2024 presidential nomination is shaping up to be a contentious one for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. His campaign recently sounded the alarm on what they believe to be an overt attempt by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to stifle his bid against President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who is currently steering the Kennedy campaign, recently pointed out that the DNC seems to have established a class of pledged delegates named Party Leaders and Elected Officials (PLEOs). According to Kucinich, these PLEOs bear a striking resemblance to super delegates, given the influence the party has over them. “The repositioning of these delegates puts the DNC in a spot where it could override the popular vote,” Kucinich stated, emphasizing the gravity of potentially ignoring the voice of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reordering of state primaries by the DNC, aimed at penalizing states that did not cast their votes in Biden’s favor in the 2020 elections, also came under scrutiny. Kennedy’s campaign has cautioned that such a move could discount the votes of millions, making mail-in voting the only option for many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the DNC has been embroiled in such controversies. Observers can’t help but recall 2016 when there were allegations of the DNC favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Kennedy, sharing his dismay on Fox News, mentioned, “They are even pondering making me foot the bill for the primaries.” He further criticized the DNC’s logic, suggesting they believe there’s no need for a primary when a candidate is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s recent reshuffling of the 2024 primary schedule, placing South Carolina at the forefront on Feb. 3, is another significant point of contention. The DNC’s strict guidelines dictate that states not adhering to this altered schedule could face penalties, with a deduction of half their delegates at the national convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kucinich, echoing the sentiments of many, has reached out to DNC Chair Jaime Harrison twice in the past week, seeking a conversation between Kennedy and Harrison. The aim is to emphasize the importance of voter rights and safeguarding the voice of the populace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing the topic further on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters Prime Time,” Kucinich stated, “Mr. Kennedy’s sole objective is to ensure that every single Democrat vote in the primaries holds weight.” Highlighting the questionable tactics of the DNC, Kucinich expressed fears that even if Kennedy received a significant majority of votes, the DNC’s positioning of extra delegates could still sway the result in Biden’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further aggravating the situation, the DNC’s decision to abstain from hosting debates between Democratic candidates has caused alarm. Both Marianne Williamson and Kennedy, the Democrats challenging Biden, have voiced their concerns on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfolding situation puts the spotlight on the DNC’s actions and decisions leading up to the 2024 elections. Only time will tell how this will impact the race and, more importantly, the voters’ faith in the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The road to the 2024 presidential nomination is shaping up to be a contentious one for Robert F.

The infamous Pasadena home that served as the backdrop for Laurie Strode’s (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) nightmarish encounters with the relentless Michael Meyers is now listed for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iconic property, which provided the setting for the chilling events of Haddonfield, Illinois, in the 1978 movie, has remained with one family for three generations. Now, according to the New York Daily News, it awaits a new owner with a listed price of $1.799 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realtor’s description emphasizes the home’s cinematic significance, drawing attention to its familiar stoop: “If you watch the film, you’ll recognize the infamous stoop that Jamie Lee Curtis sat on, holding a pumpkin.” But beyond its filmic connections, the house has undergone transformations over the years. Originally portrayed as a single-family residence, it has since been subdivided into three separate units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property also boasts a historic fruit-bearing avocado tree, a remnant from the 1940s, planted by the sellers’ grandfather. This detail provides a touch of nostalgia to the otherwise eerie history of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Lee Curtis, now 64, has an intimate bond with the Halloween series, crediting it with many positive turns in her life. Reflecting on her connection to Laurie, she told People magazine, “everything good in my life can be traced back to Laurie.” Curtis even recalls spotting her now-husband of 37 years, Christopher Guest, in a 1984 Rolling Stone article while she was with Debra Hill, the writer of the original Halloween. “Life is scary. But Laurie taught me that life can also be beautiful, filled with love and art and life!” Curtis expressed, cherishing her role’s impact on her personal and professional journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called “murder house” wasn’t only featured in the original film. It made a return in the 2021 sequel, “Halloween Kills,” where a harrowing scene involving firefighters unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realtor Heidi Babcock captures the allure of this unique listing, stating, “This exceptional property is a wonderful place to live, work, and play in one of the most desirable communities in greater LA.”&lt;/p&gt;

Michael Waltz, R-Fla., voiced his concerns regarding the United States’ recent decision to partake in prisoner swaps with Iran. Highlighting the potential repercussions of such moves, Waltz emphasized that this could unintentionally encourage more hostage-taking incidents by hostile entities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waltz, expressing his sympathy and heartbreak for the affected families, recounted an earlier incident in 2015 involving the Iran deal. “One of these hostages was left behind back in 2015 with the original Iran deal. John Kerry, [Then-Secretary of State], was promised the hostage’s release. However, even after the hostage remained in captivity, Kerry went ahead and signed the deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels with the current scenario, Waltz expressed his concerns: “The problem with this deal is that future Americans are at risk of being taken hostage all over again.” Waltz’s argument is based on a simple yet concerning principle: When nations like the US give in to the demands of hostage-takers, it provides a strong incentive for other hostile actors, whether they are nations like Iran or Russia, or even terrorist groups, to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further added, “There’s no downside for these hostage-takers. In most scenarios, they find themselves in advantageous positions, either financially or through swaps.” Drawing attention to a recent swap involving the world’s largest arms dealer for Brittney Griner, Waltz underlined the troubling pattern that seems to be emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer to his criticism, Waltz voiced his concerns regarding the lack of transparency from the current administration. “This is just a horrific deal. Despite being a member of both the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, we are still in the dark about who these Iranians are that Biden’s administration is releasing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions involving prisoner swaps are always delicate, with multiple facets to consider. Yet, Waltz’s caution serves as a reminder that, while the immediate resolution of a crisis is paramount, it’s equally essential to consider the long-term implications of such decisions. The well-being and safety of future American citizens overseas might very well depend on the choices made today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a candid conversation with “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Rep.

A new Gallup poll suggests that over one in five American workers now harbor concerns about their job’s future due to rapid technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising Concern Over Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published this Monday, the poll reveals that 22% of Americans worry that technology might render their jobs redundant. These concerns have seen a marked increase over the years since Gallup first started monitoring this sentiment in August 2017. At that time, a mere 13% expressed such fears. The figure showed a modest rise to 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, only to dip back to 15% in 2021. An interesting observation tied to this is the increasing prevalence and attention on artificial intelligence since the 2021 poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallup’s data shows a significant shift in concerns among the college-educated workforce, with their fears spiking from 8% to 20%. On the other hand, workers without a college degree have maintained a nearly constant worry level at 24%. This indicates that the disparity in technological replacement concerns between the college-educated and non-college-educated workers has narrowed, with both groups now exhibiting parallel anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Differences in Concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll further underscores the generational difference in apprehension, indicating that younger workers are more concerned about technology making their jobs obsolete than their older counterparts. Additionally, those earning less than $100,000 annually express more anxiety compared to those with higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Workplace Fears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the dread of technology-induced job redundancy, the Gallup poll highlighted other significant worries among American workers. The leading concern is a potential reduction in wages or benefits. While 31% of the respondents fear a cut in their benefits, 24% are anxious about a potential wage decrease. Concurrently, 20% of those polled are concerned about potential layoffs, with 19% fearing a reduction in working hours. Interestingly, only 7% expressed worry over their jobs being outsourced overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this research, Gallup interviewed 491 part-time or full-time adult workers in the U.S. between August 1 and August 23.

After being on the field for only a few minutes into his debut with the Jets, Rodgers suffered an ankle injury, putting a damper on the night for Jets fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The injury occurred when Buffalo Bills linebacker Leonard Floyd managed to sack Rodgers. Although Rodgers initially attempted to brush off the setback, he soon needed assistance to leave the field. This was a sight no sports fan ever wishes to see – a prominent player being escorted off the field, especially during a debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent broadcasts from ESPN showed Rodgers, with evident difficulty, making his way onto a cart that transported him towards the stadium’s tunnel. He was then spotted limping towards the locker room, and later, with a protective boot on his injured ankle. Before this unfortunate turn of events, Rodgers had yet to complete a pass, with a record of 0-for-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Rodgers out of the picture, the Jets had to rely on Zach Wilson, their former starting quarterback. Wilson, who started for the Jets during his first two seasons, was supposed to be the backup to Rodgers after losing his primary spot towards the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Rodgers, this game was meant to be an exhilarating first with the Jets, having recently showcased his prowess in a preseason match against the New York Giants where he threw an impressive touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson. Pre-game, he had spoken about the “butterflies” he felt during that preseason match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a light-hearted moment before the game, when asked about his feelings on stepping onto the field for his Jets’ debut, Rodgers had humorously remarked that he’d probably be “sobbing.” He had further added that he looked forward to the experience and the energy of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

The extent of Rodgers’ injury remains to be seen, and fans across the nation are hoping for a swift recovery for the renowned quarterback.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden’s Absence - A Misstep in 9/11 Commemoration?</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/12/Biden-911-Decision/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden’s Absence - A Misstep in 9/11 Commemoration?" /><published>2023-09-12T08:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-12T08:02:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/12/Biden-911-Decision</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/12/Biden-911-Decision/">&lt;p&gt;In a concerning development that seems to further highlight the tone-deaf approach of the Biden administration, President Joe Biden made the decision to abstain from attending this year’s ceremonies dedicated to the harrowing memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This event, deeply etched in the psyche of Americans, deserved the President’s presence and acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Ted Cruz, in his candid discussion on “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” expressed no surprise at the President’s decision. Cruz emphatically stated that this wasn’t the first time the administration’s actions have come across as out of touch with the sentiments of the American public, especially those directly affected by the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a mistake. I think the president has an obligation to tell the American people what it was about, to bring them together,” Cruz rightly pointed out. This view gains even more significance when one considers the recent news surrounding plea deals involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be a primary architect of the 9/11 attacks. The Pentagon, under the Biden administration, was seemingly inclined towards these plea deals, ostensibly to circumvent the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unsettling nature of these potential plea deals sparked widespread condemnation. Cruz, along with Representative Nicole Malliotakis from New York, sent a clarion call against such decisions. Their voices, echoing the anguish and concerns of millions of Americans, seem to have resonated, with the administration consequently backing down from the proposed plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruz didn’t hold back in highlighting a pattern of concerning decisions: “But when it comes to this administration and foreign policy, they’ve put politics ahead of everything. This administration doesn’t want to talk about 9/11. They want to put 9/11 behind them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse is the perceived connection between these questionable decisions and the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. The move was hurriedly executed, seemingly to align with the 9/11 anniversary, notwithstanding serious apprehensions from officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the Biden administration needs to reevaluate its approach, ensuring that the emotions and sentiments of the American populace aren’t treated as mere afterthoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a concerning development that seems to further highlight the tone-deaf approach of the Biden administration, President Joe Biden made the decision to abstain from attending this year’s ceremonies dedicated to the harrowing memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Gem No More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a set of distressing videos were shared on Twitter by local activist Jamie Hammonds. The footage paints a bleak picture of the greenbelt — trash, including liquor bottles, needles, and other debris, stretches “as far as the eye can see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammonds candidly commented on the video, lamenting, “It’s just been destroyed.” He compared the situation to the degradation of the Violet Crown, another greenbelt compromised by a homeless encampment earlier in the year. “It is so much worse than the Violet Crown Trail,” Hammonds emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City’s Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the alarming deterioration of the greenbelt, approximately 72 encampment residents, along with their pets, were moved to the city-managed Southbridge shelter in mid-August, an action under Austin’s Housing-Focused Encampment Assistance Link (HEAL) Initiative. The city’s approach to the escalating homelessness issue is focused on relocating encampments that present significant “public health and safety risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this wasn’t the first time such an intervention was deemed necessary. In under two years, Austin officials have had to relocate residents from similar encampments twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin is currently orchestrating a cleanup operation for West Bouldin Creek. With multiple departments on the task, the cleanup could span from weeks to potentially several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relocation followed incidents around the encampment that roused public safety apprehensions. Earlier this year, a SWAT team recovered stolen military-grade weapons and ammunition from the camp. Recent reports also include a brush fire igniting at another homeless camp near MoPac and Park Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Funding and the Way Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin has earmarked a staggering $55 million for housing stabilization, crisis response, and public space management. Furthermore, they’ve channeled over $100 million from the American Rescue Plan Act into enhancing homeless services and related system improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Council Member José “Chito” Vela emphasized the critical need for mental health and substance use treatments. He highlighted these treatments, when combined with housing, will play a pivotal role in a holistic homelessness prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For locals like Greg Smith, who resides near the West Bouldin Creek, there’s still hope. While acknowledging the complexity of the challenge ahead, he believes that the solution, though possibly spanning several years, is within reach. Smith’s faith remains unwavering in Austin’s community spirit. “I believe that Austin residents…will do whatever they can to help those folks who are experiencing homelessness and get their green space back,” Smith concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Austin, Texas, a city renowned for its vibrant arts scene and natural beauty, is grappling with an escalating issue — the extensive damage caused to its West Bouldin Creek Greenbelt by a homeless encampment.

&lt;p&gt;Happening outside one of Aldean’s recent concerts in Chicago, the group’s heated demonstration involved vitriolic chants against the U.S. and the artist. Their distorted perception labels the country anthem, which celebrates the core values of America, as “fascist.” It’s a reminder of the far-left’s increasing intolerance towards differing viewpoints and its attempts to stifle voices that challenge their narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such aggressive antics, Jason Aldean remains unfazed, with his song’s popularity soaring to the top of several charts. This is a testament to the song’s resonance with vast sections of the American populace, who identify with its message. It’s ironic that while corporate giants like Paramount-owned CMT chose to censor the song’s music video, the public responded by amplifying its reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics, likely driven by political biases, have wrongfully labelled the song as racist, without providing substantive evidence. Aldean’s track, in reality, critiques the unchecked rioting and lawlessness witnessed in 2020, emphasizing a need for order and respect for community values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the prominent figures defending Aldean’s right to freedom of speech is former President Donald Trump. He lauded the country singer on Truth Social, highlighting Aldean’s genuine talent and urging the public to support him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that while extreme factions like the Revolution Club may shout loudly, their voice doesn’t reflect the majority.

This incident underscores the volatile nature of areas along the Mexico-Texas border, particularly amidst ongoing cartel conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving through Los Guerra en route to the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, the tourists were ambushed along the Riberena highway near the El Angel statue. Employing a makeshift armored vehicle, the assailants rammed the cars in the convoy, immediately following which additional gunmen opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive? A possible case of mistaken identity. Sources within law enforcement have shared with Breitbart Texas that these Gulf Cartel gunmen likely misconstrued the tourists as rival gang members or police forces encroaching on their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of this violent encounter left at least seven tourists with varying injuries. Swift action by local authorities ensured these individuals were rushed to the Miguel Aleman-Roma port of entry, where U.S. ambulances promptly transported them to hospitals for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident is an unsettling reminder of the precarious environment near the Tamaulipas border. The Gulf Cartel, embroiled in territorial disputes with opposing factions, has not only been clashing with rivals but has also accrued a dark record of attacking tourists, committing kidnappings, extortions, and executing murders targeting unsuspecting individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
