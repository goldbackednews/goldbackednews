A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/11/01/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-11-01T14:20:14-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-01T14:20:14-04:00</updated><id>/2023/11/01/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/11/01/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">The Downfall of San Francisco: Bank Closures as a Symptom of Democrat-led Disorder</title><link href="/news/2023/11/01/Bank-Closures-San-Francisco/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Downfall of San Francisco: Bank Closures as a Symptom of Democrat-led Disorder" /><published>2023-11-01T13:16:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-01T13:16:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/11/01/Bank-Closures-San-Francisco</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/11/01/Bank-Closures-San-Francisco/">&lt;p&gt;San Francisco, once a booming city of prosperity, now faces a devastating economic decline. Local bank branches are shuttering across the city at an alarming rate, with 20 branches closing their doors through Oct. 28 this year alone. This trend is not just a local issue; it’s part of a nationwide crisis where financial institutions are vanishing, leaving residents without essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s descent into chaos, marked by crime, homelessness, and a drug epidemic, has created a hostile environment for businesses. The Democratic policies that dominate San Francisco’s political landscape have only exacerbated these issues, leading to a surge in crime rates and creating an unsafe atmosphere that has driven businesses away. As a result, many banks have been forced to close, often without warning, leaving residents and local businesses scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the closures in San Francisco this year surpass the total number of closures from the previous two years combined. It’s a shocking trend that speaks volumes about the dire state of the city’s economy and safety. From the central Richmond District to Bayview, no area has been spared, underscoring the pervasive nature of this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California as a whole is not faring much better, with 277 bank branches closing statewide so far this year, a number second only to the record set in 2020 when 325 branches shuttered. These closures are a stark contrast to the mere eight branch openings that have occurred statewide this year, painting a grim picture of the financial landscape in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these closures can be attributed to the move to online banking and industry-wide consolidation, many are directly tied to the city’s ongoing exodus of retail businesses, a situation worsened by persistent shoplifting problems and the inability of local authorities to address these issues effectively. The commercial center of San Francisco, once bustling with activity, is now struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to remote work, further hampered by the Democrat-led city’s failure to address the rising crime rates and create a safe and secure environment for businesses and residents alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alarming trend of bank closures is a clear indication that the policies of the Democrat-led city are failing its residents. The lack of action to address the rising crime rates, combined with the economic fallout from the pandemic, has created a perfect storm that is driving businesses away and leaving the city in disarray. As conservatives, we must stand firm in our commitment to law and order, economic prosperity, and the well-being of our communities, and hold those in power accountable for their failure to uphold these principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">San Francisco, once a booming city of prosperity, now faces a devastating economic decline.

George Santos as the House Ethics Committee promises a decision by November 17th on the “next course of action” for the beleaguered congressman. Santos, drowning in a sea of federal charges and bipartisan disdain, faces the stark reality of his actions catching up with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the possibility of a House vote on a resolution for his expulsion, Santos finds himself at the center of a whirlwind investigation. The Ethics Committee, diligently led by Michael Guest and top Democrat Susan Wild, has tirelessly reached out to around 40 witnesses, sifted through over 170,000 pages of documents, and approved 37 subpoenas to uncover the truth behind Santos’s murky dealings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With accusations ranging from identity theft of campaign donors, unauthorized credit card charges, falsification of campaign finance reports, to money laundering, the list of federal charges against Santos totals a staggering 23. Yet, despite these serious allegations, Santos remains defiant, pleading not guilty and refusing to step down. His resistance is in stark contrast to the calls for resignation from both sides of the aisle, reflecting a blatant disregard for accountability and the values we hold dear as Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several New York Republicans, unwilling to let this blatant misconduct slide, are fervently pushing for a resolution to expel Santos from Congress. The urgency of the situation is palpable, with a potential vote to oust him being considered as early as Wednesday. The gravity of this action cannot be understated - expelling a member from the House requires a two-thirds majority vote, a clear indication that this is not a decision taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewind to May, and we saw House Republicans blocking a Democrat-led initiative to expel Santos, opting instead to entrust the Ethics Committee with deciding his fate. This decision, made in the spirit of due process, now culminates in the impending announcement from the committee, a moment that will undoubtedly be a turning point in this saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we await the committee’s decision, it is crucial to reflect on the values that define us as Republicans and as Americans. Accountability, integrity, and a commitment to the truth are non-negotiable, and Santos’s actions stand in stark contradiction to these principles.

The actress’s son, John Weatherly, confirmed her passing, which occurred at her home in Henderson, Nevada on October 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans’ journey in the entertainment world was nothing short of remarkable. As the goddaughter of the legendary Joan Crawford, she was destined for stardom from a young age. Her parents, Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert, were both well-established screenwriters, penning the script for “On the Loose,” one of Evans’ most memorable films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1950s saw Evans rise to prominence, starring alongside Esther Williams in the 1952 musical hit “Skirts Ahoy!” and delivering compelling performances in “Edge of Doom,” “Our Very Own,” “Column South,” and “No Name on the Bullet.” Her acting prowess and on-screen charm captivated audiences, making her a household name and a beloved figure in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in New York in 1934, Evans’ mother served as a Hollywood reporter for Photoplay magazine, often covering Crawford’s rising career. This close-knit relationship between Evans’ family and Crawford played a significant role in shaping her life and career. “They were best friends,” Evans recalled in a 2013 interview with Foster Hirsch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans’ journey, however, was not without its trials. She shared a harrowing experience from the set of “Roseanna McCoy” in 1948, where she was accidentally shot in the arm, requiring emergency surgery and a hospital stay. This incident, while traumatic, showcased Evans’ resilience and determination, traits that defined her both on and off the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans’ personal life was as captivating as her film career. At a dinner party hosted by Crawford, she and Kirby Weatherly decided to tie the knot, a spontaneous decision that resulted in a midnight wedding officiated by a judge Crawford had called over. Evans and Weatherly’s marriage stood the test of time, lasting until his death on January 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her relationship with Crawford, Evans spoke warmly of the star, remembering her as a “wonderful, darling friend” and debunking the myth of the diva actress. The bond between Evans and Crawford remained strong until Crawford’s death in 1977, a testament to their enduring friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joan Evans leaves behind a legacy of cinematic excellence, personal resilience, and a life well-lived. She is survived by her son, John, daughter, Dale, and grandson, Chris.

Large sums of money changing hands within the family, coupled with President Biden’s denial of involvement in his son’s international business dealings, have raised eyebrows and serious questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial tapestry woven by the Biden family includes a questionable $200,000 payment received by Joe Biden from his brother, James Biden, following a loan of the same amount granted to James by a health care company he was affiliated with. The exchange was purportedly for access and influence, a claim that brings into question the ethics of the family’s dealings. This is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a pattern that has persisted over the years, with the family using loans and other financial mechanisms to maneuver money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the labyrinth of the Biden family’s finances, the use of over 20 shell companies to move money discreetly has also come to light. This, coupled with the ‘loans’ used to facilitate the transfer of funds between family members, paints a picture of complexity and secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we dig deeper, another layer of this financial web reveals itself. In 2020, Hollywood attorney Kevin Morris cleared a $2 million unpaid tax liability for Hunter Biden. Initially labeled as a ‘loan,’ the paperwork supporting this claim seemed to materialize only after the IRS began raising suspicions, casting further doubt on the nature of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These financial intricacies demand transparency and scrutiny, especially when they involve individuals in the highest offices of the land. The House of Representatives has taken up the mantle to investigate, ensuring that those in power are held accountable and are not using their positions for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers from the IRS have also come forward, alleging that the Biden Justice Department obstructed investigations into potential campaign finance violations involving the Biden presidential campaign. This accusation adds another layer of complexity to the situation, emphasizing the need for a thorough and impartial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the House delves into these so-called ‘loans’ and financial dealings, the American people watch closely, with polls indicating that nearly half of the adult population believes President Biden may have been involved in illegal activities concerning his son. The trust in our institutions and in our leaders is at stake, and it is incumbent upon Congress to uncover the truth, wherever it may lead.&lt;/p&gt;

This bold move has been neatly packaged in the “Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,” a directive that on the surface promises innovation and progress but delves deeper into a sea of questionable decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unacquainted with the notorious H-1B visa program, it is a gateway for approximately 200,000 foreign graduates annually, promising them a slice of the American Dream. However, critics like Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. TechWorkers, are calling out Biden’s decision, likening it to setting up a new era of indentured servitude. The program is not just a vessel for top-tier talent as it’s often portrayed but has become a tool for corporations to displace American workers, holding their foreign employees’ futures hostage with the dangling carrot of a green card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 1.5 million visa workers already saturating various sectors of the U.S. job market, the expansion of this program only stands to exacerbate the issue. The Biden administration, backed by Fortune 500 lobbyists and investors, is pushing this agenda forward, indifferent to the potential career derailment for skilled American graduates. Employers are quick to cash in on this opportunity, leaving American workers in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divyansh Kaushik, an imported Indian immigrant and representative of a white-collar employers lobby group, has already laid out a comprehensive list of ‘benefits’ this executive order brings to the table. From easier visa renewals to fast-tracked green cards for favored foreigners, it’s a shopping list designed to serve employers, not employees. This, while native STEM graduates are left grappling with a saturated job market, as highlighted by a 2021 Census Bureau report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s most troubling is the sheer volume of technically skilled American graduates being flushed out of their careers, especially as they age. The displacement does not just impact individual careers but has far-reaching implications on national competitiveness and innovation. While Biden’s directive promises growth and leadership in innovation, it simultaneously undermines the very workforce capable of driving that progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that the issue at hand is not migration itself, but the insatiable hunger of Wall Street for short-term profits, a hunger that seems to be dictating policy decisions. The Biden administration’s plan, veiled as a step towards innovation, is a dangerous dance with economic instability, sidelining American workers in favor of short-term corporate gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we navigate through this sea of contradictions and questionable policy decisions, one thing is clear: the American worker deserves better. The Biden administration’s directive is a stark reminder of the urgent need for policies that prioritize the American workforce, ensuring a future where innovation and progress are driven by the very people who call this nation home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a recent maneuver that has left many scratching their heads, President Joe Biden has unabashedly opened the floodgates for more white-collar migration into the United States, specifically targeting the jobs that our own debt-ridden graduates so desperately need.

His net worth has reportedly skyrocketed by an astounding 650% over the last decade, raising eyebrows and questions about the ethics of wealth accumulation while in government roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gensler, who took the reins of the SEC in 2021, has watched his fortune grow from between $15.5 million and $61.8 million in 2009, to a staggering $40 million to $116.2 million as of his most recent financial disclosure. These figures, revealed through financial filings obtained by Fox News Digital, shed light on the opulence that can be amassed even while serving in lead public-service roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gensler’s portfolio is diverse, with substantial investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a considerable property in Maryland. His largest investment lies in Vanguard’s Total Market Index Fund ETF, valued between $25 million and $50 million, while his second-largest is a stake in Vanguard’s European Stock Index Fund ETF, worth between $5 million and $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that such wealth accumulation while in public service raises serious questions about the integrity of our government officials. The revelation of Gensler’s financial prosperity comes at a time when bipartisan lawmakers are pressing for reforms on federal officials’ stock market trading activities, aiming to ensure that those in power are not profiting at the expense of the American public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Josh Hawley has been vocal about this issue, stating, “Politicians and civil servants shouldn’t spend their time day trading and trying to make a profit at the expense of the American public.” His sentiments are echoed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, emphasizing the need for transparency and integrity among government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gensler’s journey to affluence has predominantly been through public service roles, including his tenure as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) during the Obama administration, his leadership at the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, and various advisory positions. His lucrative positions and investments raise questions about the potential conflicts of interest and the moral responsibility of public servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue of wealth accumulation in public service is not isolated to Gensler alone. Other prominent figures, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci and numerous congressional members, have also seen their net worths burgeon while serving the public. This pattern necessitates a reevaluation of the systems in place, ensuring that those entrusted with the nation’s welfare are held to the highest standards of integrity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where trust in government is at a premium, the story of Gary Gensler serves as a stark reminder of the work that needs to be done to restore faith in our public institutions. As we navigate these challenging times, it is imperative that we demand accountability and transparency from our leaders, ensuring that public service remains a noble calling, free from the allure of personal financial gain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Gary Gensler, the man appointed by President Biden to lead the nation’s top financial regulator - the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seems to have struck gold during his years in public service.

The culprit? None other than the ominous Bidenflation, as rising burger prices contribute to the fast-food giant’s unexpected financial upswing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s profits and sales have beaten all estimates, pushing shares higher and leaving investors satisfied. However, this leaves the average American grappling with the reality of rising costs and a strained budget. Revenue shot up by 14 percent, reaching an astounding $6.69 billion, surpassing the expected $6.56 billion. Comparable store sales grew by 8.8 percent, leaving analysts’ 8.0 percent increase prediction in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s Chief Executive, confidently stated, “The macroeconomic environment is unfolding in line with our expectations for the year, and we continued to deliver convenience and value for our customers.” But at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. alone, comparable store sales witnessed an 8.1 percent increase, outpacing the forecasted 7.5 percent growth. “Comparable sales results benefited from strong average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases,” McDonald’s admitted. The stark reality is that these “strategic” price hikes are a direct result of the rampant inflation under the Biden administration, coined as Bidenflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in prices did manage to counteract a noticeable decline in foot traffic to McDonald’s locations. Yet, this reveals a concerning trend: higher costs are driving customers away, particularly those in lower income brackets. Kempczinski noted, “One of the things that we saw industry-wide is that that low-income consumer, which we would say is $45,000 and under, was negative from an industry standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income saw a boost, rising to $2.32 billion, or $3.17 a share, a significant increase from the previous year’s $1.98 billion, or $2.68 a share. Adjusted earnings per share settled at $3.19, surpassing the estimated $3.00 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While McDonald’s might be reveling in its financial success, the harsh reality of Bidenflation looms large, with everyday Americans bearing the brunt of rising prices and a cost of living crisis. The fast-food giant’s prosperity serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for economic reform and relief from the financial strain imposed by the current administration.

Shockingly, Murphy used a whopping $12,000 in state funds to revel in food and drinks at a Taylor Swift concert and various other stadium events, as initially reported by Politico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Murphy’s indiscretions were exposed when his office revealed that it had dipped into a $95,000 personal expense account, which is explicitly set up for “Official Receptions, Official Residence, and Other Official Expenses.” The guidelines are clear – these funds are not to be used for personal purposes. Yet, Murphy saw fit to spend lavishly on his own enjoyment, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill for his entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with this gross misuse of funds, Murphy’s office hastily claimed that they intended for the state Democratic Party to cover the costs and that they are now “pursuing reimbursement” for the expenses incurred at MetLife Stadium. But the question remains: Why did the Governor believe it was appropriate to use taxpayer money for his personal partying in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Sciortino, a spokeswoman for Murphy, tried to justify the expenditures by stating, “Once it was clear that there were outstanding bills that had not been paid, the state stepped up to meet this responsibility.” However, this statement does little to appease the rightly angered public who are tired of politicians misusing their hard-earned money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this situation even more galling is the fact that former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, found himself in a similar situation but chose to have the state Republican Party reimburse the approximately $82,000 spent at MetLife Stadium. Christie’s actions demonstrate a level of accountability and responsibility that Murphy seems to lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public records have laid bare the extent of Murphy’s frivolous spending, including nearly $1,000 at a Taylor Swift concert in 2018 and thousands more at various sporting events. This level of extravagance is unacceptable, especially when it is funded by the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Governor’s office scrambles to do damage control, it is clear that Phil Murphy has shown a blatant disregard for the responsible use of taxpayer money. New Jersey residents deserve better than a Governor who parties on their dime, and it is time for Murphy to be held accountable for his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a state already grappling with its share of political scandals, including charges against Senator Bob Menendez for acting as a foreign agent, Murphy’s lavish spending adds insult to injury. New Jerseyans are left wondering: when will enough be enough?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Governor Phil Murphy has come under intense scrutiny for his extravagant spending of taxpayer money.
