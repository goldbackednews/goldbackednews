A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">A Billion Dollar Misjudgment - Eric Trump Defends Mar-a-Lago’s True Worth</title><link href="/news/2023/09/27/Mar-a-Lago-Value-Controversy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Billion Dollar Misjudgment - Eric Trump Defends Mar-a-Lago’s True Worth" /><published>2023-09-27T11:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-27T11:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/27/Mar-a-Lago-Value-Controversy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/27/Mar-a-Lago-Value-Controversy/">&lt;p&gt;A New York judge’s estimation of Mar-a-Lago’s worth at around $18 million has sparked an uproar, with Eric Trump alleging the value of the property is massively understated, insisting its actual worth could be over a billion dollars. However, there’s considerable skepticism and debate surrounding these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-valuation-dispute&quot;&gt;The Valuation Dispute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Trump’s vociferous response to the valuation reflects his belief in a calculated degradation of Mar-a-Lago’s real value, part of what he views as an orchestrated attempt to tarnish his father’s name and to ostracize him from New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspective-and-comparisons&quot;&gt;Perspective and Comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To substantiate his claims, Eric Trump shared images of residential listings in Palm Beach, purportedly showing market values far surpassing $35 million. He asserts that these properties, despite their high valuations, do not compare to Mar-a-Lago due to their smaller sizes, lack of premium locations, and inability to span across Palm Beach Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump is securing unexpected support from Hispanic voters as recent polls depict a surprising shift within the Hispanic Republican demographic. This newfound alliance is catching the eyes of political spectators, hinting at a potential reshaping of voting patterns in upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-univision-poll&quot;&gt;The Univision Poll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking poll by Univision revealed Trump’s expanding influence among Hispanic voters, showing 50% of Hispanic Republicans expressing their vote for Trump in the GOP primary. These findings point to a seismic change in political alignments, positioning Trump as a dominant figure within this key demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-tides&quot;&gt;The Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing multiple federal indictments, Trump’s overall support within the Hispanic community has risen to 36%, reflecting a four-point increase since he left office in January 2021. The broader Hispanic electorate, however, remains primarily liberal, with 58% choosing Biden over Trump in a hypothetical match-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economy---the-paramount-concern&quot;&gt;Economy - The Paramount Concern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hispanic voters, the economy seems to be the epicenter of concern, overshadowing other pressing issues like healthcare costs and housing prices. More than half of Hispanic voters believe that Democrats can better address these economic challenges, yet a significant number feel disenchanted with both parties’ ability to offer satisfactory solutions. This communal concern about the economy could be a pivotal factor, potentially altering established voter trends and party loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;border-security---a-bipartisan-agreement&quot;&gt;Border Security - A Bipartisan Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hispanic voters are also deeply concerned about border security, a sensitive topic that usually polarizes the electorate. Interestingly, this demographic exhibits a rare consensus, with both Hispanic Democrats and Republicans largely concurring on the necessity for elevated border security measures. With 41% of voters trusting Republicans and 40% trusting Democrats to handle the migrant crisis, it unveils a nuanced perspective within the community, providing both parties a window of opportunity to strengthen their stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insight-into-complex-sentiments&quot;&gt;Insight into Complex Sentiments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Univision poll, one of the most extensive of its kind, provides crucial insights into the intricate and diverse sentiments within the Hispanic community, shedding light on their needs and wants. It discloses a complex interplay of opinions, emphasizing the significance of understanding and addressing the concerns of this pivotal voter base. These nuanced findings showcase a multifaceted Hispanic electorate whose concerns and inclinations could play a decisive role in shaping the political landscape of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion---a-political-turning-point&quot;&gt;Conclusion - A Political Turning Point?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Trump consolidates his influence among Hispanic Republicans, he crafts a narrative of unexpected alliances and shifting loyalties.

This incident, occurring at 8 p.m. Monday, was confirmed by Anthony Guglielmi, the chief of communications for the United States Secret Service (USSS). The officer, part of the uniformed division, was treated on the spot by medical personnel and is reportedly doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for the first lady, mentioned the stress that family pets might experience due to the intense and unpredictable nature of the White House environment. The first family is reportedly working on solutions to help Commander adapt better to his surroundings. The Bidens have also expressed their gratitude to the Secret Service and the Executive Residence staff for their dedication to maintaining security and well-being within the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first instance of aggressive behavior exhibited by Commander, a purebred German Shepherd, or other dogs owned by the Bidens.

&lt;p&gt;The previous dog owned by the Bidens, Major, also a German Shepherd, had similar aggressive encounters, leading to his relocation to live with friends in Delaware.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shakiras-tax-evasion-saga&quot;&gt;Shakira’s Tax Evasion Saga&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish authorities are holding the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer responsible for failing to pay 6.7 million euros (approximately $7.1 million) in taxes for her 2018 income, accusing her of utilizing an offshore company to achieve this. This allegation follows a previous one where she supposedly owes $15.4 million for the years between 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defending-her-fiscal-integrity&quot;&gt;Defending her Fiscal Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira maintains that during the disputed years, her official residence was in the Bahamas, meaning she is not liable to pay the said taxes to Spain. She insists through her representatives that she has “always cooperated and abided by the law” and believes her innocence will prevail in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;november-court-appearance&quot;&gt;November Court Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira, having rejected a plea deal, is scheduled for a trial in November.

This revelation highlights the fluctuating dynamics and uncertainties revolving around the upcoming electoral showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-opinion---trump-leads-the-way&quot;&gt;Public Opinion - Trump Leads the Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the poll, published on Monday, 46% of registered voters would back Trump, while Biden would secure 41%, leaving 13% of voters undecided. This potential five-point lead for Trump over Biden stirs reflections on the voters’ mindset and political allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trump appears to enjoy a near-double-digit advantage among independents, with 42% in favor of Trump to Biden’s 34%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;party-solidarity---republicans-rally-behind-trump&quot;&gt;Party Solidarity - Republicans Rally Behind Trump&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the poll portrays Republicans unifying behind Trump more robustly than Democrats rallying for Biden. In this hypothetical match-up, 86% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats would favor Trump, while Biden would earn the support of 80% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This could signify deeper party solidarity and potential cross-party appeal of Trump,” political analysts comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perspectives-on-candidacies---voters-express-reservations&quot;&gt;Perspectives on Candidacies - Voters Express Reservations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll not only reveals voters’ preferences but also gauges the voters’ opinions on whether both men should contest for the presidency. Only 31% of registered voters believe Biden should run again, while a significant 69% think he should not. The numbers are slightly more favorable for Trump, with 44% supporting his run and 56% opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the parties reveals that nearly three in four Republicans believe Trump should attempt to reclaim the Oval Office, highlighting a disparity in intra-party support compared to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gop-landscape---trump-dominates&quot;&gt;The GOP Landscape - Trump Dominates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Republican party, Trump’s dominance remains evident. He garners the support of 56% of registered Republicans, with his closest competitor, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), lagging by 42 points at 14%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The GOP primary scenario underscores the significant influence and popularity Trump continues to wield within his party,” observes Charles Standard, Senior Political Correspondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political landscape shapes up for the hypothetical 2024 presidential face-off between Trump and Biden, early polls are painting a picture of shifting sands and public opinion leaning towards Trump. The differing levels of support within their respective parties, along with the public’s reluctance about their candidacies, set the stage for an intriguing and intense electoral journey ahead.

This potential five-point lead for Trump over Biden stirs reflections on the voters’ mindset and political allegiance. Trump appears to enjoy a near-double-digit advantage among independents, with 42% in favor of Trump to Biden’s 34%. Party Solidarity - Republicans Rally Behind Trump Interestingly, the poll portrays Republicans unifying behind Trump more robustly than Democrats rallying for Biden. In this hypothetical match-up, 86% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats would favor Trump, while Biden would earn the support of 80% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans. “This could signify deeper party solidarity and potential cross-party appeal of Trump,” political analysts comment. Perspectives on Candidacies - Voters Express Reservations The poll not only reveals voters’ preferences but also gauges the voters’ opinions on whether both men should contest for the presidency. Only 31% of registered voters believe Biden should run again, while a significant 69% think he should not. The numbers are slightly more favorable for Trump, with 44% supporting his run and 56% opposing it. A closer look at the parties reveals that nearly three in four Republicans believe Trump should attempt to reclaim the Oval Office, highlighting a disparity in intra-party support compared to Biden. The GOP Landscape - Trump Dominates Within the Republican party, Trump’s dominance remains evident. He garners the support of 56% of registered Republicans, with his closest competitor, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), lagging by 42 points at 14%. “The GOP primary scenario underscores the significant influence and popularity Trump continues to wield within his party,” observes Charles Standard, Senior Political Correspondent. Conclusion As the political landscape shapes up for the hypothetical 2024 presidential face-off between Trump and Biden, early polls are painting a picture of shifting sands and public opinion leaning towards Trump. The differing levels of support within their respective parties, along with the public’s reluctance about their candidacies, set the stage for an intriguing and intense electoral journey ahead.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jpmorgans-multimillion-dollar-settlement&quot;&gt;JPMorgan’s Multimillion-Dollar Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-profile bank has reached a substantial settlement, agreeing to pay $75 million to resolve the lawsuit led by the U.S. Virgin Islands. This suit contends that JPMorgan gained substantial benefits from the illicit and reprehensible activities of its client, Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-alleged-profiteering&quot;&gt;The Alleged Profiteering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan allegedly ignored numerous warning signs and deliberately overlooked Epstein’s involvement in trafficking young women to his private island. This purported oversight was motivated by the bank’s interest in maintaining the lucrative business of Epstein and his affluent circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-step-toward-healing---support-for-victims&quot;&gt;A Step Toward Healing - Support for Victims&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the total settlement amount, $10 million will be allocated to establish a fund aimed at providing mental health services to Epstein’s victims, as a means of extending support and facilitating recovery for those affected by his heinous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subsequent-legal-developments&quot;&gt;Subsequent Legal Developments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resolution follows a preceding $290 million settlement reached with Epstein’s victims a few months prior. The accumulating financial reparations highlight the intensified scrutiny and mounting legal pressures surrounding entities and individuals linked to Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stringent-anti-trafficking-measures&quot;&gt;Stringent Anti-Trafficking Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to prevent future complicity in such atrocities, JPMorgan has committed to implementing and maintaining robust anti-trafficking measures. Virgin Islands Attorney General Ariel Smith emphasized that the settlement is a historic victory for survivors and a wake-up call for Wall Street about its legal responsibilities to prevent human trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-glimpse-into-epsteins-activities&quot;&gt;A Glimpse into Epstein’s Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein’s secluded properties, such as the blue-striped structure on Little St. James Island, serve as constant reminders of his dark and criminal endeavors. He had acquired and developed these properties over two decades ago, furnishing them with lavish amenities, including a music room fitted with a grand piano and acoustic walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-wall-street---a-call-to-responsibility&quot;&gt;The Role of Wall Street - A Call to Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This settlement underscores the obligations of financial giants like JPMorgan to detect and forestall human trafficking and illicit activities. While the settlement doesn’t imply any admission of liability from JPMorgan, it does invoke reflection on the ethical and legal responsibilities that banks hold in monitoring and reporting suspicious and criminal activities linked to their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflection-and-resolution&quot;&gt;Reflection and Resolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal repercussions and financial settlements ensuing from the Epstein scandal continue to accentuate the importance of vigilance, ethical conduct, and legal compliance within the financial sector. JPMorgan’s commitment to implementing stricter anti-trafficking measures signifies a step toward preventing similar associations in the future and reaffirms the financial sector’s responsibility to uphold lawful and ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">JPMorgan is drawing to a close another chapter in the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein saga with a $75 million settlement with the U.S. Virgin Islands, following allegations that the bank profited from Epstein’s notorious sex trafficking operations.

His legal representatives have drafted a comprehensive 25-page brief opposing the DOJ’s attempt to muzzle Trump’s voice, citing violations of free speech and the need for governmental transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fighting-for-the-first-amendment&quot;&gt;Fighting for the First Amendment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s legal team is fervently contesting the proposed gag order, claiming it to be a direct infringement upon his First Amendment rights. In a political climate where scrutiny and criticism of governmental action are paramount, they argue that suppressing Trump’s perspectives is a blatant attempt to obstruct public critique of the prosecution’s conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal proceedings are unveiling amidst a series of efforts to diminish Trump’s outspokenness. Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team have expressed concerns over Trump’s inflammatory and confrontational language, suggesting it could potentially influence jurors’ opinions and compromise the integrity of legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argue that Trump’s aggressive remarks not only intimidate individuals and institutions but also encourage acts of threats and harassment against the entities he criticizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He inspires others to perpetrate threats and harassment against his targets,” prosecutors declare, outlining the detrimental consequences of Trump’s rhetorical aggressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is also combating initiatives by certain Democrats to prohibit his presence on the 2024 presidential primary ballots, leveraging the protective provisions of the U.S. Constitution as his safeguard. Several states are concurrently striving to exclude his candidacy owing to his purported role in the Capitol incidents on January 6, 2021, perceived by opponents as a rebellion against the nation. His lawyers are steadfast in their stance that Trump’s commentary regarding the 2020 elections is constitutionally protected, refuting any insinuations of his involvement in the alleged insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serene ambiance of a Friday evening at Twentynine Palms, California, was interrupted when a civilian, in a vehicle, attempted illegal access into the Marine base around 8:19 p.m., eliciting immediate response from a military police officer.&lt;/p&gt;

The move is seen as an attempt to catch up with Trump, who had already announced his plans to support the striking workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biden-in-the-shadow-of-trump&quot;&gt;Biden in the Shadow of Trump?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rendezvous with striking workers unfolds amidst high inflation and substantial government subsidies on electric vehicles—hallmarks of “Bidenomics.” Biden’s unexpected decision to stand with UAW members and address them through a bullhorn reflects a gesture not recalled in U.S. labor history from a sitting president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Biden’s move to support striking workers directly is unprecedented, suggesting a tactical maneuver to counter Trump’s strong foothold among blue-collar workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-timeline-of-reactions&quot;&gt;A Timeline of Reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of events is intriguing. Trump announced on September 18 that he would be visiting striking workers in Detroit on September 27, opting to support them over attending the second Republican presidential primary debate. The announcement seemed to send shockwaves through the Democratic ranks, stirring a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days after Trump’s announcement, Biden declared he would be visiting UAW workers, and his visit conveniently occurred a day before Trump’s planned appearance. This sequence of actions raises eyebrows, hinting at a reactive stance from Biden, seemingly following Trump’s lead in an attempt to secure support from the labor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-historical-context&quot;&gt;The Historical Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, sitting presidents have steered clear of direct involvement in strikes, opting to maintain a balance between the rights of workers and the broader economic implications of labor disruptions. Even ardent pro-union presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman did not join ongoing strikes. Biden’s recent actions, therefore, mark a significant departure from historical precedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Biden’s boldness in supporting the UAW strike is reminiscent of the support President-elect Barack Obama showed for an illegal strike by workers at a window factory before he assumed office in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;political-implications&quot;&gt;Political Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s alignment with the UAW strike, especially in the wake of Trump’s announcement, seems to paint a picture of a presidency trying to keep pace, responding to the movements of its predecessor. The mirroring of actions emphasizes the political tussle between the two figures, with each seeking to solidify their standing with workers and the broader electorate. The question that lingers is whether Biden’s attempt to align himself with laborers is a genuine gesture of solidarity or a calculated political move to regain the limelight stolen by Trump’s proactive stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a climate rife with political maneuvering, Biden’s step to join the UAW picket line underscores the ongoing duel for influence between him and Trump. The unfolding events present a tableau of a presidency in response mode, reacting to the strategies laid down by Trump.
