A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Ohio Fugitive Confronts Armed Georgia Homeowner - A Glimpse Into a Night of Valor</title><link href="/news/2023/09/17/Ohio-Man-Georgia-Home-Invasion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ohio Fugitive Confronts Armed Georgia Homeowner - A Glimpse Into a Night of Valor" /><published>2023-09-17T06:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-17T06:06:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/17/Ohio-Man-Georgia-Home-Invasion</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/17/Ohio-Man-Georgia-Home-Invasion/">&lt;p&gt;Late into the night, in a quiet Georgia neighborhood, an ordinary family found themselves in a harrowing situation. A man, wanted in Ohio for murder, had broken into their home. Little did he realize, the homeowner was prepared and determined to protect his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-invasion&quot;&gt;The Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael James Brooks II, known for his involvement in a series of crimes including a fatal stabbing in Ohio, broke into a residence in Georgia. However, the family man of the house was ready. Armed with a firearm and keen instincts, he confronted Brooks, who was wielding a knife, in his basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon spotting the intruder, the homeowner didn’t immediately resort to force. He issued a warning to Brooks. But as events escalated, he had to fire two shots to defend himself and his family. This quick thinking and bravery potentially saved multiple lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prompt-police-response&quot;&gt;Prompt Police Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fayette County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) was alerted to the situation by a security alarm triggered at the house. With deputies just three minutes away, the homeowner made a strategic move. He took a defensive position on the second-floor staircase, preparing for any possible confrontation as Brooks made his way upwards. By the time the police arrived, Brooks had sustained two gunshot wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks is currently in medical care. Once released, he is set to face a series of charges including burglary, home invasion, and theft in Georgia, along with murder charges in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots&quot;&gt;Connecting The Dots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection between Brooks and the crime scene was made clear when a Ford truck, reported stolen from Kettering, Ohio, was found outside the burglarized home in Georgia. It was this lead that confirmed Brooks’ involvement. The vehicle had plates different from the original, indicating a possible attempt to conceal his tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators also believe that Brooks might have approached several homes in the Georgia neighborhood before zeroing in on the residence he invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-glimpse-into-brooks-past&quot;&gt;A Glimpse into Brooks’ Past&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Columbus Division of Police identified Brooks as the main suspect in another home invasion that resulted in the tragic death of 77-year-old Emily Foster. This invasion took place in the city’s University District on September 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact motivations and means by which Brooks moved from Ohio to Georgia remain a matter of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident, though harrowing, stands as a testament to the importance of being prepared.

This incident sheds light on Mexico’s escalating challenges related to migrants and their perilous journey towards the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomatic-plea-for-help&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Plea for Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue was initiated after the Iranian Embassy in Mexico City reached out to local authorities, reporting that several Iranian citizens had been abducted within the city. Even after the victims’ families complied with the ransom demands, the captors failed to release them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting on the information, Mexican law enforcement swiftly pinpointed a stash house located in the Venustiano Carranza borough. The subsequent raid led to the apprehension of one man and three women, all of Venezuelan origin, responsible for the crime. Rescued from the confinement were three Iranian women, one Iranian man, an adult male, and a child, both from Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing their operation, the police soon arrested two women, recognized as Mexican citizens, who were alleged proprietors of the property used for holding the victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-worrying-trend&quot;&gt;A Worrying Trend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though authorities have yet to disclose specifics about the kidnapping or the ransom sum, this incident aligns with a distressing pattern emerging in Mexico. As the country grapples with an immigration crisis, cases of migrant abductions are on the rise. These unfortunate travelers often become pawns in the hands of human smuggling rings, who exploit their vulnerable state. The families of these migrants are then coerced into paying ransoms to ensure the safety and continuation of their loved ones’ perilous journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more migrants attempt to cross into the U.S., Mexico faces an arduous task in ensuring their safety and curbing these illicit activities. The recent rescue operation stands testament to their commitment, but also highlights the looming challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a daring operation this week, Mexico City authorities successfully rescued four Iranian citizens and two Ecuadoran migrants who were held captive and ransomed.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loyal-ties-and-big-money&quot;&gt;Loyal Ties and Big Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A billionaire in his own right, Johnson’s relationship with the former president Trump is well-documented. Not only a longstanding friend but also a staunch supporter, Johnson reportedly approached numerous Republican billionaires, advocating for their backing of Trump’s campaign. As reported by CNBC, insiders privy to the matter reveal the essence of Johnson’s appeal: it’s high time to support Trump as he is poised to be the nominee, judging by the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all have been eager to jump onboard the ‘Trump Train’. Prominent figures such as Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, steel tycoon Andy Sabin, and real estate magnate Stephen Ross have expressed reservations, with some pointing to the U.S. Capitol riot in January 2021 as a significant deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;momentum-in-numbers&quot;&gt;Momentum in Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be overshadowed by the reluctance of some, Johnson himself has made a hefty contribution of $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. As controversies encircle Trump, there’s a surprising twist. Trump’s popularity among the Republican voter base has witnessed a notable uptick. A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicates that nearly 63% of Republicans are in favor of Trump making another presidential run. This figure marks an increase from 55% earlier this year. Moreover, Trump’s favorable opinion ratings among Republicans are up, currently standing at 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this surge within the party might not be sufficient in a broader electoral landscape. Trump’s challengers from within the GOP suggest that while he might be revered within the party, winning a general election – where reaching beyond the GOP base is vital – might remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will determine if Johnson’s efforts will lead to a successful touchdown for Trump or if they will face an interception by the larger electorate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amidst the political storm, Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets and former American ambassador to Britain, emerges as a pivotal figure rallying major donors for Donald Trump’s potential presidential bid.

Amidst the clamor, two potential pathways to replacing Biden have emerged, though the clock is ticking rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-primary-path---will-a-challenger-rise&quot;&gt;The Primary Path - Will a Challenger Rise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every election year, the Democratic party gears up for its primary election process, a tried and tested system to choose the most suitable candidate for the general elections. Between January to June next year, Democrats will be flocking to polling booths across the nation to cast their vote for a presidential nominee. The early indications? Biden is in for a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Marianne Williamson have already thrown their hats in the ring. However, the majority of Democratic voters remain unconvinced by their candidacy. The real game-changer would be if a well-established, broadly appealing candidate were to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin Newsom, California’s Governor, seems poised to fill that role. His recent actions - touring Republican states, advocating for national gun control referendums, and even challenging Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for a Fox News debate - have elevated his profile, making him a strong contender. But is the Biden camp worried? Publicly, they see Newsom as a valued associate. Privately, rumors paint a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Newsom isn’t the only name generating buzz. Michigan’s popular governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Pete Buttigieg, the current Transportation Secretary who ran for the presidency in 2020, are also considered potential contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline clock, however, is ticking. States have specific deadlines for candidates to declare their intention to run, with Nevada setting the earliest deadline on October 15th. By the end of the year, 14 more states will have set their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-convention-conundrum---can-biden-step-down&quot;&gt;The Convention Conundrum - Can Biden Step Down?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second pathway for Biden’s potential replacement lies within the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August next year. Here, Biden has a card to play. Even if he clinches the majority of delegate votes, he has the option to withdraw his candidacy. Should he choose to do this, the convention would turn into a free-for-all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Democratic party guidelines, while pledged delegates aren’t obligated to vote for the candidate they initially supported, they are expected to “reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” A Biden endorsement could be a game-changer in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this isn’t without complications. A “contested” convention, where no candidate gets a majority, could devolve into chaos, showcasing a fractured party just months before the general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-historical-challenge&quot;&gt;A Historical Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the annals of modern political history, an incumbent president has never been ousted from his party’s nomination during a re-election bid. The last time a convention even neared “contested” status was back in 1980 for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any potential candidate willing to challenge Biden’s nomination, the road ahead is filled with historical precedence and procedural challenges. With the clock rapidly winding down, the Democratic party faces an unprecedented choice as 2024 looms on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">With the 2024 presidential primaries on the horizon, a rising tide of voices within the Democratic party is debating the viability of President Biden as their candidate for a second term.

A beloved teacher, Mariame Sylla, met with a grim end after she went out for a seemingly routine walk. Harold Landon III, a man previously embroiled in violent acts against women, has emerged as the prime suspect behind this heinous act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-chilling-sequence-of-events&quot;&gt;A Chilling Sequence of Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harrowing tale began on July 29, when Sylla, a cherished figure in the Greenbelt community, went out for her regular walk. What transpired next remains shrouded in mystery and horror. Days after her disappearance, parts of her dismembered body surfaced in a pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Harold Landon III had a past tainted with episodes of violence, the connection between him and Sylla appears non-existent. Authorities are scratching their heads, trying to decipher a motive or any semblance of a relationship between the two. The baffling nature of the crime has amplified its ghastliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prior-charges-and-controversial-defense&quot;&gt;Prior Charges and Controversial Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landon, currently 33, had already been incarcerated, accused of infringing an order of protection against his former girlfriend. The police in Prince George’s County, after connecting the dots, identified him as the potential assailant behind Sylla’s tragic demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent court session, the presiding judge labeled the case as having “horrific facts.” Yet, Landon’s defense team has taken a stance that challenges the evidence stacked against their client. They’ve contended that the foundational proofs, including DNA evidence and photographs, are merely circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Counsel Jonathon Church remains unperturbed. He expressed his firm belief in the strength of the case, pointing out the clarity with which Landon was identified in the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-victims-legacy-and-communitys-grief&quot;&gt;The Victim’s Legacy and Community’s Grief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mariame Sylla, a beacon of hope and inspiration for many, has left behind a community in mourning. The 59-year-old teacher was a figure of admiration and respect, with Prince George’s County Police Chief Malik Aziz lauding her contributions. Sylla’s funeral saw an outpouring of grief, attended by a diverse crowd, including her past students, colleagues, and diplomats from her homeland, Ivory Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her tragic and unforeseen death reignites pressing concerns over the safety of women. Aisha Braveboy, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney, emphasized Landon’s track record of female abuse, alluding to his prior conviction in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigations remain in full swing, with the authorities committed to bringing justice to Sylla and her grieving family. Landon, as of now, is held without bail and is slated to appear before the court on Oct. 11 for preliminary hearings on the charges of first-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the legal proceedings evolve, one thing remains clear: Mariame Sylla’s untimely demise has created a void that may never be filled, and her legacy as a beloved teacher and community member will be etched in memories forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A gruesome discovery has shaken the Maryland community to its core.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a contingent of Democrats faced a barrage of furious protesters during a press conference focused on the escalating migrant crisis in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, strategically positioned outside the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan - a now-established relief center for asylum seekers - was overshadowed by a vocal crowd chanting, “Send them back!” and “Close the border!” The cacophony became so pronounced that the messages of the Democratic leaders were often lost amidst the fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ocasio-Cortez tried to bring attention to the resources and support being pooled for the migrants, a megaphone-wielding protester shouted her down, emphasizing the legality of immigration. His words, “Illegal immigration is not right! Respect the constitution, close the border!” rang out loud, echoing a sentiment shared by a significant portion of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) sought to convey the dire circumstances many of the migrants were escaping from, painting a picture of families fleeing violence and environmental disasters. Amidst the chaos, he optimistically noted that such migrants could positively contribute to the fabric of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roosevelt Hotel serves as more than just a symbol in this ongoing debate; it’s a genuine lifeline. Providing food, vaccinations, and the assistance of caseworkers, it stands as a testament to the city’s ongoing efforts to manage the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delegation present, besides Ocasio-Cortez and Espaillat, included several high-profile Democratic representatives from various states, indicating the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the clamor, Ocasio-Cortez outlined three significant consensus points: a call for increased federal resources, the urgency for work authorizations to expedite migrants’ employment, and the extension of Temporary Protected Status, especially for the Venezuelan populace who make up a considerable portion of the current migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a shadow looms large. New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently expressed deep concerns, labeling the migrant influx, which has seen over 110,000 individuals since last year, as a potential doom for the Big Apple. His grim projection paints a daunting picture of a city teetering on the brink, with strained resources and a public increasingly divided on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

This novel development permits its premium subscribers to verify their profiles using government-issued identity cards, courtesy of a collaboration with the Israel-based identity verification stalwart, Au10tix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, European subscribers, including those in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, find themselves on the outside looking in. The stringent data protection statutes in these territories are the likely culprits behind their exclusion from this innovative offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s venture elucidated its rationale behind this feature, highlighting its dedication to authentication for the prevention of impersonation. Additionally, Musk’s platform aims to provide its users with age-appropriate content and fend off the threats of spam and malicious accounts. Thus, ensuring the platform remains a bastion of healthy discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct pop-up will be at the forefront of this verification journey, indicating that Au10tix could retain the user’s personal data for a span extending to 30 days. Upon successful verification, a noteworthy acknowledgment will grace their profile. This acknowledgment, symbolized by a verified blue checkmark, will be the beacon of assurance for fellow users, signifying the authenticity of the profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a carrot for those opting for this verification. They stand to gain “prioritized support from X Services.” Nevertheless, the exact nature of this privileged support is shrouded in ambiguity. Some detractors have voiced their skepticism, terming the ID-based verification as a redundant exercise, seemingly yielding minimal advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tandem with this announcement, X/Twitter divulged its roadmap to streamline the review process for its verified accounts. A further perk for these verified aficionados is the liberty to frequently revamp their names, display pictures, or even their usernames, without the peril of surrendering their coveted verified status. But herein lies a catch - this luxury is the preserve of the paying clientele, triggering debates about its universality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid chat with Bloomberg, X/Twitter illuminated its overarching goal with this venture. The company aims to link, for those who so desire, their accounts to tangible identities, by leveraging their official IDs. The ulterior motive is to fortify the platform’s defenses against impersonation, thereby elevating its security quotient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unveiling is a stark contrast from the platform’s move a few months prior, where it phased out its traditional verification program. This abrupt shift, leading to the removal of verification badges, stirred a tempest among its user community. The ensuing tumult forced the company’s hand, culminating in the restoration of the coveted verification checkmark for its marquee users.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a push for enhanced security and to combat impersonation, Elon Musk’s revolutionary social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), has rolled out a trailblazing feature.

Being at the helm of America’s favorite quiz show is no small task, and Bialik’s journey has been an intriguing blend of praise, criticism, and self-growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigating-the-challenges&quot;&gt;Navigating the Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bialik has been under the microscope, with some fans dissecting her every move, expression, and hosting style. This was highlighted in the recent “Inside Jeopardy!” podcast episode where producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss discussed Mayim’s reactions to contestants’ answers. Bialik had openly shared her amazement at contestants’ swift recall abilities, often expressing her astonishment when they got things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her genuine surprise was endearing to some, it became a point of contention for others, including the show’s producer. As Whitcomb Foss suggested, maintaining the pace and flow of the show was paramount, stating, “Yes, correct, you got it” should suffice as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

Many lamented her taking extra moments after contestant responses, potentially stemming from her habit of being impressed by the contestants. Additionally, perceived inconsistency in rulings earned her some flak, with claims of being too strict in her judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s noteworthy to mention the contrast in hosting styles between Bialik, a seasoned actress, and Jennings, an iconic “Jeopardy!” player.
