A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-10T12:21:04-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-10T12:21:04-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Virginia Man Faces Dual Life Sentences Over Fatal Assault on Toddler</title><link href="/news/2023/10/10/Child-Tragedy-Virginia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Virginia Man Faces Dual Life Sentences Over Fatal Assault on Toddler" /><published>2023-10-10T11:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-10T11:45:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/10/Child-Tragedy-Virginia</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/10/Child-Tragedy-Virginia/">&lt;p&gt;In a tragic event that has shaken the state of Virginia, a man has been sentenced to two life terms after being found guilty of fatally attacking a 2-year-old toddler and later neglecting to provide her with the needed medical care, which led to her unfortunate demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assailant, 37-year-old Andrew Byrd, was convicted in March on multiple counts, including aggravated murder and aggravated malicious wounding, for the 2020 assault on Harper Mitchell, his girlfriend’s young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Rehak, the Commonwealth’s Attorney, shared his sentiments on the case, noting that it was one of the gravest crimes on record. The horrific details paint a clear picture of a brutal attack on an innocent child, with Rehak stating, “&lt;em&gt;This defendant tortured that poor little girl.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred on April 16 in Byrd’s Roanoke residence. The child’s mother, Amanda Mitchell, was away at work, leaving Harper and her siblings under Byrd’s supervision. Upon her return, Amanda found Harper in a distressing state — bruised, cold, and unresponsive. However, Byrd’s violent tendencies did not end there. As Mitchell tried to seek medical help, Byrd stopped her, going as far as threatening the life of her other children, the local media sources reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roanoke Times described how Byrd prioritized his drug habits over the life of the young child, with Rehak mentioning that Byrd’s primary concern that fateful night was “&lt;em&gt;getting high&lt;/em&gt;”. It was only the following morning that Mitchell could reach out to Byrd’s mother, leading to a 911 call. Although Harper was immediately rushed to a hospital, she could not be saved. The extent of her injuries, as described by medical examiner Dr. Amy Tharp, resembled those sustained in a severe car accident. The cause of death: blunt-force trauma to the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the defense tried to protect Byrd by pointing out the lack of eyewitnesses and highlighting his history with substance abuse, their arguments did not hold up against the overwhelming evidence. Byrd had previously attempted to justify Harper’s injuries by suggesting she might have fallen down stairs or off a four-wheeler. Commonwealth’s Attorney Rehak didn’t mince words in court, describing Byrd as a “&lt;em&gt;dangerous, violent liar&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a moving statement during the sentencing, the child’s father, TJ Mitchell, expressed the deep void left behind by Harper’s tragic passing. Circuit Judge Joey Showalter emphasized that no individual, especially an innocent child, should ever face such brutality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case unfolds further, Amanda Mitchell faces her own legal battles with charges of child abuse, cruelty, and drug possession. Byrd also has additional charges to answer for, related to the alleged abuse of Mitchell’s sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where child abuse continues to be a haunting reality, Harper Mitchell’s story serves as a heartbreaking reminder of the need for continued vigilance, protection, and justice for the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a tragic event that has shaken the state of Virginia, a man has been sentenced to two life terms after being found guilty of fatally attacking a 2-year-old toddler and later neglecting to provide her with the needed medical care, which led to her unfortunate demise.

Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and several other GOP members are urging President Biden to reconsider this arrangement, particularly in light of Iran’s alleged involvement in recent attacks on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackburn highlighted her concerns on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating, “&lt;em&gt;The Biden administration is refusing to acknowledge Iran’s role in the unprovoked terrorist attacks on Israel.&lt;/em&gt;” Drawing on a Wall Street Journal report, she emphasized Iran’s potential contribution to plotting the assaults on Israel. Her message was clear: “&lt;em&gt;The United States should not be sending a single penny to Iran — let alone $6 billion. I am immediately calling on Biden to reverse course and cancel the ransom agreement.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting Blackburn’s stance, Pennsylvania Senate Republican candidate Dave McCormick called upon the Biden administration to block the transfer of promised funds to Iran, especially in light of the Hamas-led strike on Israel. He pledged that as a Senator, he would spearhead legislation to prevent the allocation of these funds, emphasizing, “&lt;em&gt;Don’t give Iran a penny.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns aren’t only about recent events. Former President Donald Trump chimed in on the issue, suggesting that the Biden administration’s decision to move the $6 billion in previously frozen Iranian assets indirectly enabled the recent terrorist activity in Israel. He was quoted saying, “&lt;em&gt;This war happened for three reasons: … the United States giving Iran $6 billion dollars ransom; and our country’s perceived weakness with an incompetent and corrupt leader, Joe Biden, who’s laughed at all over the world&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the chorus, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) expressed his reservations about the Biden administration’s foreign policy decisions, emphasizing that perceived weakness could incite global aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tensions continue to rise in the Middle East and concerns about the U.S.’s role and responsibility in global politics remain at the forefront, it remains to be seen how the Biden administration will navigate this complex and sensitive issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Amidst the turmoil in Israel, Republicans are raising alarm bells over a $6 billion agreement between the Biden administration and Iran.

Trump is of the firm belief that such atrocities in Israel would never have occurred had he still been in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, who is seeking the presidency for the third consecutive time, emphasized that under his leadership, peace in the Middle East was maintained, specifically citing the Abraham Accords. Drawing a clear line between the peace of his term and the current unrest, Trump stated, “Today we have an all-out war in Israel, and it’s going to spread very quickly. What a difference a president makes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant point of contention in Trump’s speech was a recent move by the Biden administration involving a $6 billion transfer to Iran. This move, aimed at releasing five detained U.S. citizens, involved the transfer of frozen Iranian assets from South Korea to an account in Doha, Qatar. Republicans, including Trump, argue that this deal inadvertently provided resources that aided Hamas’ assault on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has emphasized its unwavering support for Israel in these trying times. President Biden remarked that the U.S. stands firmly with the people of Israel and will ensure the nation has the resources to defend itself. Despite these assurances, the central criticism from the Republican side remains fixated on the financial transfer to Iran, seeing it as a misstep that indirectly fueled the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump further elaborated on his administration’s tough stance on Iran, highlighting how he reduced the Iranian economy, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and imposed sanctions. In a bid to keep America safe, he also initiated strict travel bans targeting radical Islamic terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His commitment to Israel was clear as he vowed, “As president, I will once again stand strongly with the state of Israel, and we will cut off the money to the terrorists on day one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the criticism from Trump and other Republicans, the Biden administration continues to assert its firm support for Israel’s right to defend itself, with many in the administration condemning the actions of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

Her opinions, shared with her millions of followers, have sparked significant debate online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalifa, boasting a massive following of 5 million on Twitter and 27.5 million on Instagram, shared a plethora of posts on Saturday expressing her firm stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Referring to one image of the aggressors, she commented that it looked like a “Renaissance painting.” Mia Khalifa’s significant reach ensures that her perspectives make a notable impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the subject of the long-standing conflict, Khalifa remarked, “If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid and history will show that in time.” She further expressed disbelief at the idea of the “Zionist apartheid regime” facing challenges from guerrilla fighters, some of whom she humorously noted were donned in “fake Gucci shirts”.&lt;/p&gt;

Having sold his Malibu home for $6.25 million earlier this year, he has set up roots in Las Vegas, highlighting his dissatisfaction with California’s governance and policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My home in Malibu was going to be my forever home,” Cain reminisced, emphasizing his love for the scenic beauty and weather. However, he lamented, “Governments can ruin an area. And that’s what’s going on in California.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the significant challenges Cain points to is California’s substantial governance, which he describes as laden with “incredible taxation” and “horrible regulations.” Dean’s criticisms do not stand in isolation. Many Californians have raised concerns about the state’s rising taxes, from income tax, which stands at a high bracket of around 13%, to numerous other taxes, including those on gas, sales, food, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the financial aspects, Dean Cain also cited concerns about California’s stance on crime, its growing homelessness crisis, and specific policies like a bill addressing child custody and gender identity issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These collective issues have fueled what Cain sees as a “mass exodus” from California. “The things that our leaders in California have been doing have driven out anybody who can really afford to get out,” he stated. He also criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration, sharing that he didn’t vote for the current leadership, although many in California did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Cain acknowledges the state’s undeniable allure. California, particularly regions like Malibu, offers some of the best weather conditions. The actor fondly recalled instances when he experienced dramatic temperature shifts traveling between Calabasas and Malibu. He admits missing Malibu’s perfect weather but was quick to point out that vast areas of California experience temperatures as high as those in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now settled in Nevada, Cain is full of praise for his new home. Besides the allure of no state income tax, he enjoys the vibrancy of sports and entertainment options available in the state. Plus, he is particularly impressed with his new home, describing it as ten times nicer than his Malibu residence and more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his recent relocation has garnered attention, Dean Cain continues to be active in his acting career. He stars in the new movie “Condition of Return,” where he plays a psychoanalyst evaluating a woman’s mental fitness to stand trial after she commits a massacre. Cain mentions that he drew from his real-life experiences as a sworn deputy sheriff and reserve police officer to prepare for this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Dean Cain’s move from California is symbolic of a broader sentiment. As individuals evaluate the quality of life, governance, and opportunities, states like Nevada are becoming increasingly attractive. Whether this trend continues remains to be seen, but for now, stars like Cain are voting with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Dean Cain, best known for his role as Superman, recently shared insights on his decision to leave California, a state he believed he would never abandon. Having sold his Malibu home for $6.25 million earlier this year, he has set up roots in Las Vegas, highlighting his dissatisfaction with California’s governance and policy direction. “My home in Malibu was going to be my forever home,” Cain reminisced, emphasizing his love for the scenic beauty and weather. However, he lamented, “Governments can ruin an area. And that’s what’s going on in California.” One of the significant challenges Cain points to is California’s substantial governance, which he describes as laden with “incredible taxation” and “horrible regulations.” Dean’s criticisms do not stand in isolation. Many Californians have raised concerns about the state’s rising taxes, from income tax, which stands at a high bracket of around 13%, to numerous other taxes, including those on gas, sales, food, and energy. Beyond the financial aspects, Dean Cain also cited concerns about California’s stance on crime, its growing homelessness crisis, and specific policies like a bill addressing child custody and gender identity issues. These collective issues have fueled what Cain sees as a “mass exodus” from California. “The things that our leaders in California have been doing have driven out anybody who can really afford to get out,” he stated. He also criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration, sharing that he didn’t vote for the current leadership, although many in California did. Despite these challenges, Cain acknowledges the state’s undeniable allure. California, particularly regions like Malibu, offers some of the best weather conditions.

Among them is Donald Trump Jr., who recently took to social media to underline the importance of the Second Amendment in the U.S., using the Israeli conflict as a backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening of October 8, 2023, Trump Jr. wrote, “If anyone is still doubting the relevance of the 2nd amendment, just watch the videos from Israel. It’s a harsh reminder of the need for self-defense.” The sentiment, while pointed, reflects a larger conversation about individual rights to bear arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier that day, Breitbart News pointed out the disparity between the well-equipped Israeli army and the average Israeli citizen. Unlike the U.S., Israel doesn’t have a constitutional right that guarantees its citizens the right to bear arms. In fact, gun ownership in Israel stands at a mere 2% of its population, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, a study by Rutgers University’s New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center indicates that up to 60% of Americans own firearms. The distinction between the two nations, in many respects, lies in the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which ensures every American’s birthright to gun ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has strict restrictions on the type of firearms its citizens can own and the amount of ammunition they can possess. The BBC noted that Israelis typically can own a pistol with a cap of 50 bullets. Comparatively, in most American states, individuals can own an array of firearms, including machine guns, with no limitation on ammunition storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the terror attacks in Israel, Trump Jr. further emphasized his stance on gun rights, stating, “Don’t ever give up your guns!!!” He later added, suggesting the importance of self-defense, “If you don’t yet own an AR-15 you really need to think that through right about now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discourse sheds light on the ongoing global debate about gun rights, individual protection, and the role of governments in ensuring security for its citizens. Whether in the U.S. or Israel, the conversation around self-defense and gun ownership remains as pertinent as ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the turmoil intensifies in Israel, public figures worldwide are chiming in with their perspectives.

This international crisis, which has many looking to the US for a response, comes at a time when Republicans are pressing for a prompt installment of a new leader to address these global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the House of Representatives currently missing a Speaker, it’s been hamstrung in its ability to swiftly tackle the situation, even as the crisis escalates. This gap in leadership has been acutely felt, given that President Joe Biden has not sought a formal request from Congress and the Senate remains in recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the urgency, the White House has remained relatively quiet on the issue. Monday morning saw a lid called, meaning no public comments from President Biden until at least Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting with limited authority is Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry (R-NC), whose role is based on rules established post 9/11. However, his recent actions suggest a readiness to stretch these powers, evidenced by his recent eviction of Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Steny Hoyer (R-MD) from prime Capitol office space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of a solid leader has led to a legislative standstill. While House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and ranking Democrat Gregory Meeks (D-NY) have drafted a pro-Israel resolution, real legislative actions remain stagnant. This standstill is even more pronounced when considering that some members of the political sphere, like members of the Squad, have been vocally critical of the US-Israel relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a keen awareness among Republicans about the missed political opportunities this presents. Without clear leadership, they’re unable to effectively address divisive issues within their own ranks or capitalize on differences among Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the situation in Israel becomes more volatile, it’s evident that both parties are feeling the heat to move quickly. Potential contenders for the Speaker position include Reps. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Jim Jordan (R-OH). With the next potential Speaker vote expected as early as Thursday, Republicans are under pressure to choose their candidate wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As political maneuvers continue, there’s a looming need to address other urgent matters, including funding decisions with the November 17 deadline approaching. With the ousting of McCarthy, these timelines are under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the sudden Hamas-Israel crisis has added another layer of complexity to an already heated political atmosphere in the US. If a decision isn’t reached promptly about the Speaker’s position, and the global situation continues to worsen, Republicans might need to resort to unconventional measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The recent brutal Hamas attack on Israel has ignited an unexpected wrinkle in the already-tense race for the US House Speaker position.

This criticism is deeply intertwined with the grave news of Americans being killed or taken hostage during Hamas’ unexpected attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the White House National Security Council made an official announcement confirming the unfortunate loss of multiple American lives during this assault. The timing of this announcement is particularly poignant, as a memo about a scheduled White House barbecue surfaced the very next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the memo, “The President and First Lady are hosting a barbecue for White House Executive Residence staff and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confluence of these two events — the barbecue and the news of the Hamas attack — ignited a storm of outrage. Critics and commentators from various political backgrounds voiced their concerns, with many pointing out the seemingly inconsiderate juxtaposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for instance, took to his platform to express his dismay, stating, “While Hamas holds Americans hostage, Joe Biden is enjoying a picnic with a live band.” Similarly, reporter Jennie Taer commented on the disconcerting situation, citing that a war was unfolding in the Middle East involving US citizens, all while the president and the First Lady were hosting a BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political commentators and former White House officials also voiced their opinions. Katie Pavlich, a conservative commentator, and Brilyn Hollyhand, a political commentator, both highlighted the tragedy of American citizens being impacted by the conflict and juxtaposed it with the president’s decision to host a BBQ. Karoline Leavitt, a MAGA Inc. spokeswoman, contrasted Biden’s actions with those of former President Trump, suggesting the latter would’ve been more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other individuals, from journalists to commentators, also expressed their deep concerns and frustrations, with some using the tagline, “BBQ First, America Last” to summarize their sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the backdrop of this controversy, it’s important to note that the Hamas attack over the weekend resulted in the tragic loss of American lives. Confirmations from the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Mike Herzog, and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, further highlighted that American citizens were among the hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
