A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Unrest in Michigan - Biden Faces Boos from Disgruntled Autoworkers</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/28/Biden-UAW-Michigan-Visit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unrest in Michigan - Biden Faces Boos from Disgruntled Autoworkers" /><published>2023-09-28T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T06:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/28/Biden-UAW-Michigan-Visit</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/28/Biden-UAW-Michigan-Visit/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;michigans-growing-unrest&quot;&gt;Michigan’s Growing Unrest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension was evident when President Joe Biden made a brief appearance among striking United Auto Workers (UAW) in Michigan. This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photop-session-amid-industrial-action&quot;&gt;Photop Session amid Industrial Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce. The UAW is protesting for wage enhancements amid the “Bidenflation,” concerned about the possible repercussions of Biden’s electric vehicle (EV) initiatives on their employment and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-tale-of-two-engagements&quot;&gt;A Tale of Two Engagements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Biden opted for a quick photo-op, Trump actively engaged with the union members and the autoworkers, underlining their significant role in nation-building. Biden’s seemingly dismissive stance was further spotlighted as he announced his visit only after Trump’s planned engagement was made public, raising questions about the genuineness of Biden’s concern for the striking workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accusations-and-disloyalty&quot;&gt;Accusations and Disloyalty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-visit, Biden quickly transitioned to a high-profile fundraiser, leaving behind accusations of neglecting American labor and selling out jobs, intensifying the perception of his disconnection from the labor sector that is pivotal for the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflective-boos-resonate&quot;&gt;Reflective Boos Resonate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echoing boos symbolize the escalating discontent and the perceived detachment of the Biden administration from the nation’s workforce.

The unsettling detail here is the listing of Joe Biden’s residential address as the beneficiary address for the transactions, raising eyebrows and fueling suspicions regarding the integrity and transparency of the Biden family’s interactions with foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unraveling-the-chinese-connection&quot;&gt;Unraveling the Chinese Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a revelation on Fox News Channel’s “The Ingraham Angle,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-KY) stated that Hunter Biden used his father’s Wilmington home address for a significant transaction. A businessman from China, identified as Jonathan Lee, with known affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, wired $250,000 to Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Ingraham, the anchor, pointed out that the wire transfer forms notably used Joe Biden’s home address. The intricacy of such a detail makes one ponder the extent and nature of the involvement of the Bidens with Chinese businesses and potentially the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-and-suspicions&quot;&gt;Implications and Suspicions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this revelation are profound and potentially harmful, considering the listed home address is that of the sitting President of the United States. If the accusations hold weight, it could severely tarnish the image of the presidency and lead to concerns over national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Joe Biden’s address as the beneficiary’s address at a time when Hunter was allegedly not residing with his father raises questions. This anomaly necessitates a comprehensive inquiry into the reasons behind such a choice of address and the nature of the transactions and relationships involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-player&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Lee, the man behind the wire, is portrayed as a colossal business personality in China, known for his endeavors in representing Chinese interests in the United States, especially in sectors crucial to national security. This raises concerns about the influence and leverage such entities might have over American industries and, more importantly, over individuals in positions of power, such as the Bidens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bipartisan-concerns-over-china&quot;&gt;Bipartisan Concerns Over China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concerns over China’s growing influence and investment in American industries and farmlands is a mutual worry amongst both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The shared viewpoint emphasizes the need for thorough scrutiny and possible regulations to prevent China’s potential dominance over industries vital to American national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biden-lee-meetup&quot;&gt;The Biden-Lee Meetup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen the concerns, it has been unearthed that Joe Biden had had interactions with Jonathan Lee, adding another layer to the already complex and mysterious relationship between the Bidens and Chinese entities. This interaction raises further questions on the nature and intent behind their relationships and the extent of their engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Duncan attended the school’s family fun night event on September 12, with her daughter who is also a student at the academy. What started as an innocent community gathering soon transformed into a situation none could have anticipated. Two students discovered a stash of methamphetamine in a secret compartment of Duncan’s scrunchie, a revelation that led to immediate and swift actions by school officials and the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security footage from the school showed Duncan wearing the scrunchie earlier in the evening. Duncan’s scrunchie, which seemed unusually heavy, revealed a vial of white powder and a cut straw after being examined by two students. These students were quick to inform another teacher, leading to the scrunchie being secured and higher officials in the school being notified.&lt;/p&gt;

The state’s Republican leadership is spearheading discussions on potentially rejecting federal funds in favor of state funds, intending to maintain control and autonomy in how they educate their youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tennessees-independent-stance&quot;&gt;Tennessee’s Independent Stance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s consideration to sever the federal education funding strings is a significant exemplification of a state opting not to be swayed or confined by the federal government’s mandates. It is in line with Tennessee’s established conservative stance, demonstrating its commitment to prioritizing state values and principles in its governance and legislative processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We, as a state, can lead the nation once again in telling the federal government that they can keep their money, and we’ll just do things the Tennessee way,”&lt;/em&gt; remarked Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, illuminating Tennessee’s resolve to uphold its autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-the-impact&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel, called the Joint Working Group, has been constituted to study the impacts and implications of such a move. Comprising members from both the state House and Senate, this group will delve deep into the possibilities and challenges of state funding replacing federal funding for education, offering insights into whether Tennessee can independently sustain its educational endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crux-of-the-matter&quot;&gt;The Crux of the Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s leadership maintains that the education of Tennessee’s youth is paramount and should not be compromised by the strings attached to federal dollars. These federal funds invariably come laden with various mandates and restrictions, affecting the manner in which education is imparted to the children of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Federal dollars and the various mandates and restrictions that come with those dollars affect the way Tennessee’s children are educated,”&lt;/em&gt; opined Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, emphasizing the crucial nature of this potential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opposition&quot;&gt;The Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this revolutionary proposal has faced opposition, particularly from Democrats who argue that rejecting federal funds may result in “harsh consequences.” They contend that these federal funds are crucial as they support a diverse student base, including those with special needs, English language learners, and students from low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden’s re-election bid under financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blow-to-campaign-projections&quot;&gt;A Blow to Campaign Projections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden’s campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;waiting-on-bidens-blessing&quot;&gt;Waiting on Biden’s Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tentative-agreements-and-ongoing-strikes&quot;&gt;Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers’ strike as early as October. However, actors remain steadfast, continuing their strike and resulting in a dearth of celebrity fundraising events, leaving the Democrats to face the financial music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-hollywood-stars-lend-their-support-again&quot;&gt;Will Hollywood Stars Lend Their Support Again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s support was instrumental in the Biden-Harris ticket success in 2020. Celebrities threw millions at the candidates, painting the town blue. However, with Biden’s popularity plummeting amidst rising inflation and an escalating crisis at the border, Hollywood’s loyalty and financial support appear shaky at best. With the current situation labeled as toxic, the speculation is whether Hollywood stars will publicly support Biden’s campaign again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prolonged-aftermath&quot;&gt;Prolonged Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes continue to pose extensive repercussions for Democrats. As one Southern California Democratic strategist mentions, it was a “massive earthquake with prolonged aftershocks expected for months still.” Biden and the Democrats seem to be caught in a tempest with dwindling support from a crucial sector, raising the question of whether they can navigate through these turbulent times successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game of politics where financial backing can sometimes dictate the sway of power, the impact of the Hollywood strikes on Democratic coffers is evident. This situation does not only illustrate the importance of Hollywood’s support in American politics but also raises questions about Biden’s ability to manage crises and his relevance in the current political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The dual strikes by Hollywood writers and actors have reportedly had a significant impact on Democratic fundraising, including on President Joe Biden’s 2024 re-election campaign. Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden’s re-election bid under financial strain. A Blow to Campaign Projections Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden’s campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position. Waiting on Biden’s Blessing Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part. Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers’ strike as early as October. However, actors remain steadfast, continuing their strike and resulting in a dearth of celebrity fundraising events, leaving the Democrats to face the financial music.

This incident occurs amid revelations of his team’s vigorous efforts to shield him from potential falls. The almost fall and preventative measures by his team to secure his stability raise crucial questions about his physical fitness and, by extension, his ability to lead the nation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-near-miss-on-air-force-one&quot;&gt;A Near Miss on Air Force One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to Michigan, as Biden exited Air Force One, he experienced a loss of balance around the eighth step but managed to regain it swiftly, avoiding a complete tumble. It’s crucial to consider the serious implications such incidents can have on the public’s perception of his leadership capacity, particularly in the heat of an election season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lingering-health-concerns&quot;&gt;Lingering Health Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Biden was diagnosed with significant spinal arthritis by the White House physician, following which he has encountered multiple stumbling incidents. These incidents inevitably introduce speculations regarding his age and his fitness to serve as president, sparking debates across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventative-measures-in-place&quot;&gt;Preventative Measures in Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to such issues, Biden’s campaign team is reportedly taking precautionary measures, including having him wear tennis shoes and curtailing his stair climbs to prevent any more embarrassing and potentially harmful falls. Despite these efforts, the ongoing incidents lead to increased scrutiny and pose a potentially detrimental impact on his reputation and ability to govern effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-perception--presidential-fitness&quot;&gt;Public Perception &amp;amp; Presidential Fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public opinion plays a pivotal role in determining the political trajectory of a leader. A majority of the populace, as indicated by recent polls, already believes that Biden’s age might be a significant hindrance to his ability to effectively serve for another term. A staggering 77% of the population in a recent Associated Press poll believe Biden is too old to be effective for four more years, including 69% of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calls-for-change-within-the-party&quot;&gt;Calls for Change Within the Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notable concern within the Democratic party is evident, with three out of five Democrats preferring a different nominee for the 2024 elections, according to a recent poll from the Washington Post and ABC News. This emerging inclination within the party underscores the pervasive apprehensions regarding Biden’s capability to lead the nation, rooted in his recurrent physical instabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-stability-leadership-paradigm&quot;&gt;The Stability-Leadership Paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s physical stability, or lack thereof, is becoming emblematic of his leadership stability. His competency is being critically evaluated in light of these age-related incidents, and many wonder if these instances of physical instability are reflective of his ability to lead a nation. The need for a leader who can exhibit steadfastness, both physically and in policy-making, is crucial in navigating the country through tumultuous times, and Biden’s recent incidents bring his capability to do so into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Biden’s team is making concerted efforts to prevent any further incidents that could portray the President in a less favorable light, the age-related physical instabilities continue to be a subject of national debate. It’s imperative that the leader of the free world embodies strength, stability, and assurance. If President Biden’s physical struggles continue to mirror his leadership style, the faith of the nation in his ability to lead might significantly dwindle, paving the way for a re-evaluation of what is expected from a presidential figure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">President Joe Biden has been the subject of critical eyes since he nearly stumbled while disembarking from Air Force One in Detroit.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-valuation-dispute&quot;&gt;The Valuation Dispute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Trump’s vociferous response to the valuation reflects his belief in a calculated degradation of Mar-a-Lago’s real value, part of what he views as an orchestrated attempt to tarnish his father’s name and to ostracize him from New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To substantiate his claims, Eric Trump shared images of residential listings in Palm Beach, purportedly showing market values far surpassing $35 million.

&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump is securing unexpected support from Hispanic voters as recent polls depict a surprising shift within the Hispanic Republican demographic. This newfound alliance is catching the eyes of political spectators, hinting at a potential reshaping of voting patterns in upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-univision-poll&quot;&gt;The Univision Poll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking poll by Univision revealed Trump’s expanding influence among Hispanic voters, showing 50% of Hispanic Republicans expressing their vote for Trump in the GOP primary. These findings point to a seismic change in political alignments, positioning Trump as a dominant figure within this key demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-tides&quot;&gt;The Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing multiple federal indictments, Trump’s overall support within the Hispanic community has risen to 36%, reflecting a four-point increase since he left office in January 2021. The broader Hispanic electorate, however, remains primarily liberal, with 58% choosing Biden over Trump in a hypothetical match-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economy---the-paramount-concern&quot;&gt;Economy - The Paramount Concern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hispanic voters, the economy seems to be the epicenter of concern, overshadowing other pressing issues like healthcare costs and housing prices. More than half of Hispanic voters believe that Democrats can better address these economic challenges, yet a significant number feel disenchanted with both parties’ ability to offer satisfactory solutions. This communal concern about the economy could be a pivotal factor, potentially altering established voter trends and party loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;border-security---a-bipartisan-agreement&quot;&gt;Border Security - A Bipartisan Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hispanic voters are also deeply concerned about border security, a sensitive topic that usually polarizes the electorate. Interestingly, this demographic exhibits a rare consensus, with both Hispanic Democrats and Republicans largely concurring on the necessity for elevated border security measures. With 41% of voters trusting Republicans and 40% trusting Democrats to handle the migrant crisis, it unveils a nuanced perspective within the community, providing both parties a window of opportunity to strengthen their stance.&lt;/p&gt;
