A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Democrats at Crossroads - 2024’s Looming Decision</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/16/Democrats-2024-Dilemma/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Democrats at Crossroads - 2024’s Looming Decision" /><published>2023-09-16T15:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-16T15:10:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/16/Democrats-2024-Dilemma</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/16/Democrats-2024-Dilemma/">&lt;p&gt;With the 2024 presidential primaries on the horizon, a rising tide of voices within the Democratic party is debating the viability of President Biden as their candidate for a second term. Amidst the clamor, two potential pathways to replacing Biden have emerged, though the clock is ticking rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-primary-path---will-a-challenger-rise&quot;&gt;The Primary Path - Will a Challenger Rise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every election year, the Democratic party gears up for its primary election process, a tried and tested system to choose the most suitable candidate for the general elections. Between January to June next year, Democrats will be flocking to polling booths across the nation to cast their vote for a presidential nominee. The early indications? Biden is in for a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Marianne Williamson have already thrown their hats in the ring. However, the majority of Democratic voters remain unconvinced by their candidacy. The real game-changer would be if a well-established, broadly appealing candidate were to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin Newsom, California’s Governor, seems poised to fill that role. His recent actions - touring Republican states, advocating for national gun control referendums, and even challenging Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for a Fox News debate - have elevated his profile, making him a strong contender. But is the Biden camp worried? Publicly, they see Newsom as a valued associate. Privately, rumors paint a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Newsom isn’t the only name generating buzz. Michigan’s popular governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Pete Buttigieg, the current Transportation Secretary who ran for the presidency in 2020, are also considered potential contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline clock, however, is ticking. States have specific deadlines for candidates to declare their intention to run, with Nevada setting the earliest deadline on October 15th. By the end of the year, 14 more states will have set their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-convention-conundrum---can-biden-step-down&quot;&gt;The Convention Conundrum - Can Biden Step Down?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second pathway for Biden’s potential replacement lies within the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August next year. Here, Biden has a card to play. Even if he clinches the majority of delegate votes, he has the option to withdraw his candidacy. Should he choose to do this, the convention would turn into a free-for-all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Democratic party guidelines, while pledged delegates aren’t obligated to vote for the candidate they initially supported, they are expected to “reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” A Biden endorsement could be a game-changer in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this isn’t without complications. A “contested” convention, where no candidate gets a majority, could devolve into chaos, showcasing a fractured party just months before the general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-historical-challenge&quot;&gt;A Historical Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the annals of modern political history, an incumbent president has never been ousted from his party’s nomination during a re-election bid. The last time a convention even neared “contested” status was back in 1980 for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any potential candidate willing to challenge Biden’s nomination, the road ahead is filled with historical precedence and procedural challenges. With the clock rapidly winding down, the Democratic party faces an unprecedented choice as 2024 looms on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">With the 2024 presidential primaries on the horizon, a rising tide of voices within the Democratic party is debating the viability of President Biden as their candidate for a second term.

A beloved teacher, Mariame Sylla, met with a grim end after she went out for a seemingly routine walk. Harold Landon III, a man previously embroiled in violent acts against women, has emerged as the prime suspect behind this heinous act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-chilling-sequence-of-events&quot;&gt;A Chilling Sequence of Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harrowing tale began on July 29, when Sylla, a cherished figure in the Greenbelt community, went out for her regular walk. What transpired next remains shrouded in mystery and horror. Days after her disappearance, parts of her dismembered body surfaced in a pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Harold Landon III had a past tainted with episodes of violence, the connection between him and Sylla appears non-existent. Authorities are scratching their heads, trying to decipher a motive or any semblance of a relationship between the two. The baffling nature of the crime has amplified its ghastliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prior-charges-and-controversial-defense&quot;&gt;Prior Charges and Controversial Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landon, currently 33, had already been incarcerated, accused of infringing an order of protection against his former girlfriend. The police in Prince George’s County, after connecting the dots, identified him as the potential assailant behind Sylla’s tragic demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent court session, the presiding judge labeled the case as having “horrific facts.” Yet, Landon’s defense team has taken a stance that challenges the evidence stacked against their client. They’ve contended that the foundational proofs, including DNA evidence and photographs, are merely circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Counsel Jonathon Church remains unperturbed. He expressed his firm belief in the strength of the case, pointing out the clarity with which Landon was identified in the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-victims-legacy-and-communitys-grief&quot;&gt;The Victim’s Legacy and Community’s Grief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mariame Sylla, a beacon of hope and inspiration for many, has left behind a community in mourning. The 59-year-old teacher was a figure of admiration and respect, with Prince George’s County Police Chief Malik Aziz lauding her contributions. Sylla’s funeral saw an outpouring of grief, attended by a diverse crowd, including her past students, colleagues, and diplomats from her homeland, Ivory Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her tragic and unforeseen death reignites pressing concerns over the safety of women. Aisha Braveboy, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney, emphasized Landon’s track record of female abuse, alluding to his prior conviction in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigations remain in full swing, with the authorities committed to bringing justice to Sylla and her grieving family. Landon, as of now, is held without bail and is slated to appear before the court on Oct. 11 for preliminary hearings on the charges of first-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a contingent of Democrats faced a barrage of furious protesters during a press conference focused on the escalating migrant crisis in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, strategically positioned outside the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan - a now-established relief center for asylum seekers - was overshadowed by a vocal crowd chanting, “Send them back!” and “Close the border!” The cacophony became so pronounced that the messages of the Democratic leaders were often lost amidst the fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ocasio-Cortez tried to bring attention to the resources and support being pooled for the migrants, a megaphone-wielding protester shouted her down, emphasizing the legality of immigration.

This novel development permits its premium subscribers to verify their profiles using government-issued identity cards, courtesy of a collaboration with the Israel-based identity verification stalwart, Au10tix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, European subscribers, including those in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, find themselves on the outside looking in. The stringent data protection statutes in these territories are the likely culprits behind their exclusion from this innovative offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s venture elucidated its rationale behind this feature, highlighting its dedication to authentication for the prevention of impersonation. Additionally, Musk’s platform aims to provide its users with age-appropriate content and fend off the threats of spam and malicious accounts. Thus, ensuring the platform remains a bastion of healthy discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct pop-up will be at the forefront of this verification journey, indicating that Au10tix could retain the user’s personal data for a span extending to 30 days. Upon successful verification, a noteworthy acknowledgment will grace their profile. This acknowledgment, symbolized by a verified blue checkmark, will be the beacon of assurance for fellow users, signifying the authenticity of the profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a carrot for those opting for this verification. They stand to gain “prioritized support from X Services.” Nevertheless, the exact nature of this privileged support is shrouded in ambiguity. Some detractors have voiced their skepticism, terming the ID-based verification as a redundant exercise, seemingly yielding minimal advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tandem with this announcement, X/Twitter divulged its roadmap to streamline the review process for its verified accounts. A further perk for these verified aficionados is the liberty to frequently revamp their names, display pictures, or even their usernames, without the peril of surrendering their coveted verified status. But herein lies a catch - this luxury is the preserve of the paying clientele, triggering debates about its universality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid chat with Bloomberg, X/Twitter illuminated its overarching goal with this venture. The company aims to link, for those who so desire, their accounts to tangible identities, by leveraging their official IDs. The ulterior motive is to fortify the platform’s defenses against impersonation, thereby elevating its security quotient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unveiling is a stark contrast from the platform’s move a few months prior, where it phased out its traditional verification program. This abrupt shift, leading to the removal of verification badges, stirred a tempest among its user community. The ensuing tumult forced the company’s hand, culminating in the restoration of the coveted verification checkmark for its marquee users.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a push for enhanced security and to combat impersonation, Elon Musk’s revolutionary social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), has rolled out a trailblazing feature.

However, European subscribers, including those in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, find themselves on the outside looking in. The stringent data protection statutes in these territories are the likely culprits behind their exclusion from this innovative offering. Elon Musk’s venture elucidated its rationale behind this feature, highlighting its dedication to authentication for the prevention of impersonation. Additionally, Musk’s platform aims to provide its users with age-appropriate content and fend off the threats of spam and malicious accounts. Thus, ensuring the platform remains a bastion of healthy discourse. A distinct pop-up will be at the forefront of this verification journey, indicating that Au10tix could retain the user’s personal data for a span extending to 30 days. Upon successful verification, a noteworthy acknowledgment will grace their profile. This acknowledgment, symbolized by a verified blue checkmark, will be the beacon of assurance for fellow users, signifying the authenticity of the profile. There’s a carrot for those opting for this verification. They stand to gain “prioritized support from X Services.” Nevertheless, the exact nature of this privileged support is shrouded in ambiguity. Some detractors have voiced their skepticism, terming the ID-based verification as a redundant exercise, seemingly yielding minimal advantages. In tandem with this announcement, X/Twitter divulged its roadmap to streamline the review process for its verified accounts. A further perk for these verified aficionados is the liberty to frequently revamp their names, display pictures, or even their usernames, without the peril of surrendering their coveted verified status. But herein lies a catch - this luxury is the preserve of the paying clientele, triggering debates about its universality. In a candid chat with Bloomberg, X/Twitter illuminated its overarching goal with this venture. The company aims to link, for those who so desire, their accounts to tangible identities, by leveraging their official IDs. The ulterior motive is to fortify the platform’s defenses against impersonation, thereby elevating its security quotient. This unveiling is a stark contrast from the platform’s move a few months prior, where it phased out its traditional verification program. This abrupt shift, leading to the removal of verification badges, stirred a tempest among its user community. The ensuing tumult forced the company’s hand, culminating in the restoration of the coveted verification checkmark for its marquee users.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mayim Bialik’s “Jeopardy!” Rollercoaster - Navigating Critique and Celebrations</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/16/Mayims-Jeopardy-Journey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mayim Bialik’s “Jeopardy!” Rollercoaster - Navigating Critique and Celebrations" /><published>2023-09-16T10:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-16T10:07:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/16/Mayims-Jeopardy-Journey</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/16/Mayims-Jeopardy-Journey/">&lt;p&gt;When Mayim Bialik and Ken Jennings were named as permanent hosts for “Jeopardy!” after the iconic Alex Trebek’s passing, expectations were high. Being at the helm of America’s favorite quiz show is no small task, and Bialik’s journey has been an intriguing blend of praise, criticism, and self-growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigating-the-challenges&quot;&gt;Navigating the Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bialik has been under the microscope, with some fans dissecting her every move, expression, and hosting style. This was highlighted in the recent “Inside Jeopardy!” podcast episode where producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss discussed Mayim’s reactions to contestants’ answers. Bialik had openly shared her amazement at contestants’ swift recall abilities, often expressing her astonishment when they got things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her genuine surprise was endearing to some, it became a point of contention for others, including the show’s producer. As Whitcomb Foss suggested, maintaining the pace and flow of the show was paramount, stating, “Yes, correct, you got it” should suffice as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixed-fan-reactions&quot;&gt;Mixed Fan Reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the critiques from behind-the-scenes, fans have voiced their own set of concerns. Many lamented her taking extra moments after contestant responses, potentially stemming from her habit of being impressed by the contestants. Additionally, perceived inconsistency in rulings earned her some flak, with claims of being too strict in her judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s noteworthy to mention the contrast in hosting styles between Bialik, a seasoned actress, and Jennings, an iconic “Jeopardy!” player. This dynamic has led to divided fan opinions, with Jennings seemingly getting the edge for some as Bialik steps back in support of the writers’ strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-the-executive-desk&quot;&gt;From the Executive Desk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the turbulence in fans’ reactions, executive producer Michael Davies expressed the challenges of hosting “Jeopardy!” and emphasized the uniqueness each host brings. He underscored the dedication both Bialik and Jennings have towards making their roles successful, with a plea for fans to exercise patience.&lt;/p&gt;

Amongst the most anxious are Biden’s aides, who are reportedly feeling the heat from recent polls suggesting a neck-to-neck race between the two former contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gravity of Trump’s Threat&lt;/strong&gt;
CNN recently reported that the prospect of Trump returning as the Republican candidate is causing “existential stress” within the Biden camp. While Trump’s known controversial nature might make him seem like an easier opponent to some, Biden’s aides are gravely concerned. They fear that any slip-ups by the Biden campaign, or unanticipated missteps by Biden himself, could potentially see Trump return to the White House, a scenario they view as detrimental to American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Media’s Pressure on Biden&lt;/strong&gt;
The pressure isn’t solely stemming from the possibility of a Trump comeback. Liberal media outlets and respected columnists have lately turned their scrutiny onto the Biden administration. A recent piece by David Ignatius from The Washington Post called on Biden and Vice President Harris to reconsider their 2024 run, expressing concerns that their campaign could jeopardize the progress made since Trump’s defeat in the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaign Woes and Media Scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;
To add to the worries, Biden’s campaign is experiencing a noticeable absence of notable names and big checkbooks from the Democratic donor community. Aides are pointing fingers at the media, accusing them of amplifying concerns about Biden’s age and the controversies surrounding his son, Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent polls don’t help alleviate these anxieties. A significant portion of the American populace, including many from the Democratic base, have voiced concerns about Biden’s age, given he would be 86 at the end of a second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing the Future&lt;/strong&gt;
As the potential for a historic rematch between Biden and Trump becomes increasingly plausible, the Biden camp must navigate their internal apprehensions and the external pressures of the media, polls, and public opinion. The stage is set for a tumultuous run-up to 2024, with the shadows of the past election looming large.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The political landscape is buzzing with whispers of a potential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2024.

This penalty marks the maiden time TikTok has faced repercussions under Europe’s stringent data privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of Big Tech companies have their European headquarters situated in Dublin. It is here that Ireland’s Data Protection Commission decreed the fine of 345 million euros. TikTok is under fire for transgressions stemming from the latter half of 2020, primarily concerning the default settings of the accounts for teenagers. These default configurations left the accounts public, enabling unrestricted access to and commentary on their videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the “family pairing” feature, intended to allow parental oversight, had a loophole. This laxity permitted adults to activate direct messaging for users within the age bracket of 16 and 17, bypassing their consent. Moreover, TikTok reportedly nudged its younger demographic towards selecting more “privacy intrusive” alternatives during their sign-up and content upload procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TikTok has rebuffed the ruling, particularly balking at the quantum of the fine, they have indicated that most of the grievances addressed by the regulatory body were outdated. The platform underscored its proactive measures, such as making accounts of those under 16 private by default and deactivating direct messaging capabilities for the 13 to 15 age group, initiated well before the inquiry’s commencement in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these arguments, it’s evident that the European Union is taking a stand, with Brussels now stepping up to the plate to ensure stricter regulations and curb missteps in the digital realm. The essence is to retain its vanguard position in the sphere of tech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the onus of social media firms is crystal clear. They need to present options without bias, especially to the younger generation, to ensure the preservation of their privacy rights. Data privacy is an ongoing global concern, with TikTok’s data sharing with China adding another layer of complexity. The European community’s reservations regarding the potential for sensitive user information making its way to China have led TikTok to establish a data center in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broader panorama, other tech behemoths like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta have faced the music in Europe, indicating the continent’s no-nonsense approach to data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

During a recent speech, Biden seemed to link “African Americans and Hispanic workers” with individuals “without high school diplomas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Discrepancy in Words&lt;/strong&gt;
During his speech at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Md., President Biden remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, the workers without high school diplomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the White House’s transcript tells a slightly different story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen record lows in unemployment, particularly — and I’ve focused on this my whole career — particularly for African Americans and Hispanic workers and veterans, you know, and the workers without high-school diplomas. The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for women now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that there’s a discrepancy between what Biden said and how the White House chose to transcribe it. The altered version seems to create more distance between minority communities and those without high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s important to put Biden’s comments into context. Over the years, he’s made several controversial remarks, leading some to label them as instances of ‘ignorant racism’. Among these, he referred to “poor kids” being “just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” and also described former President Barack Obama as “bright and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a history of questionable statements, this latest incident has further ignited debates about the President’s perspectives on race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussions around systemic racism and inequality continue to dominate the global narrative, leaders are expected to choose their words wisely, setting a tone of inclusivity and understanding. It remains to be seen whether this latest incident will be brushed under the rug or lead to broader conversations about the inherent biases that might still exist at the highest levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a week already rife with political tension, President Joe Biden added fuel to the fire with a statement that has left many outraged.
