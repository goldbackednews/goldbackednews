A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Championing the American Dream - A Stand Against Globalism</title><link href="/news/2023/09/28/Defending-American-Workers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Championing the American Dream - A Stand Against Globalism" /><published>2023-09-28T08:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T08:01:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/28/Defending-American-Workers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/28/Defending-American-Workers/">&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump recently elucidated his stance on defending the American working class, contrasting his viewpoint with President Joe Biden’s policies. Speaking to a diverse crowd in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump criticized Biden’s approach to globalism, reaffirming his commitment to American workers, and “economic nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-economic-nationalism&quot;&gt;A Stand for Economic Nationalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump addressed his commitment to revitalizing American industries, focusing on automobile manufacturing— a lifeblood of the nation’s economy. He rebuked Biden’s overreliance on foreign batteries and rare-earth mineral mining for electric vehicles. Trump emphasized his commitment to American labor over foreign, stating: “I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empowering-american-workers&quot;&gt;Empowering American Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump communicated directly to a variety of workers including UAW members, assembly line workers, welders, mechanics, and electricians, praising them for their contributions to building the nation. His speech reflected a strong inclination towards sustaining American industry and protecting the interests of American workers. “You built this country. You love this country, and you are the ones that make our country run,” Trump appreciated, calling for a future that raises American wages, fortifies American industry, and builds national pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrasting-visions&quot;&gt;Contrasting Visions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech was clearly intended to contrast his vision of economic nationalism against what he perceives as Biden’s pandering to globalist ideals. He accused Biden of hastily planning a trip to Michigan and condemned the apparent preference of foreign profits over the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-assembly-of-blue-collar-workers&quot;&gt;An Assembly of Blue-Collar Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his address, Trump created a sense of unity and camaraderie among blue-collar workers of Michigan. He was not there merely to criticize Biden’s policies but to reassure the American worker and to salute those “who do not get the credit they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vow-to-make-america-great&quot;&gt;A Vow to Make America Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I side with the autoworkers of America and with those who want to make America great again, and I always will,” Trump vowed, underlining his perpetual allegiance to American workers. He dismissed the electric vehicle push by automakers bending to the Biden administration, calling it a threat to jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation&quot;&gt;A Battle for the Soul of the Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the UAW labor bosses allied with Biden, Trump and his campaign persisted in gathering support from various working-class groups, outlining his vision for a resurgence of economic nationalism. The speech underlined a fundamental dispute between globalism and economic nationalism, a battle for the values, dignity, and soul of the nation, resonating with those who feel overlooked and underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Trump’s energetic assembly in Michigan turned out to be more than just a political rally. It was a symphony of shared values and mutual respect, a stand for the working class against the tide of globalism, reinforcing the hope and dignity of countless Americans. His pledge to the American dream and his battle against globalism reflect a deep-rooted concern for the future of American labor and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump recently elucidated his stance on defending the American working class, contrasting his viewpoint with President Joe Biden’s policies.

&lt;p&gt;Tension was evident when President Joe Biden made a brief appearance among striking United Auto Workers (UAW) in Michigan. This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photop-session-amid-industrial-action&quot;&gt;Photop Session amid Industrial Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce.

The unsettling detail here is the listing of Joe Biden’s residential address as the beneficiary address for the transactions, raising eyebrows and fueling suspicions regarding the integrity and transparency of the Biden family’s interactions with foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unraveling-the-chinese-connection&quot;&gt;Unraveling the Chinese Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a revelation on Fox News Channel’s “The Ingraham Angle,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-KY) stated that Hunter Biden used his father’s Wilmington home address for a significant transaction. A businessman from China, identified as Jonathan Lee, with known affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, wired $250,000 to Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Ingraham, the anchor, pointed out that the wire transfer forms notably used Joe Biden’s home address. The intricacy of such a detail makes one ponder the extent and nature of the involvement of the Bidens with Chinese businesses and potentially the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-and-suspicions&quot;&gt;Implications and Suspicions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Joe Biden’s address as the beneficiary’s address at a time when Hunter was allegedly not residing with his father raises questions. This anomaly necessitates a comprehensive inquiry into the reasons behind such a choice of address and the nature of the transactions and relationships involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Lee, the man behind the wire, is portrayed as a colossal business personality in China, known for his endeavors in representing Chinese interests in the United States, especially in sectors crucial to national security. This raises concerns about the influence and leverage such entities might have over American industries and, more importantly, over individuals in positions of power, such as the Bidens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bipartisan-concerns-over-china&quot;&gt;Bipartisan Concerns Over China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concerns over China’s growing influence and investment in American industries and farmlands is a mutual worry amongst both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The shared viewpoint emphasizes the need for thorough scrutiny and possible regulations to prevent China’s potential dominance over industries vital to American national security.&lt;/p&gt;

Her arrest has spurred conversation and concern amongst parents, teachers, and the wider community, pushing everyone to reassess safety and morality within the institution dedicated to nurturing young minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-fun-night-takes-a-disturbing-turn&quot;&gt;A Fun Night Takes a Disturbing Turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Duncan attended the school’s family fun night event on September 12, with her daughter who is also a student at the academy. What started as an innocent community gathering soon transformed into a situation none could have anticipated. Two students discovered a stash of methamphetamine in a secret compartment of Duncan’s scrunchie, a revelation that led to immediate and swift actions by school officials and the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;busted---the-unmasking-of-a-meth-possessor&quot;&gt;Busted - The Unmasking of a Meth Possessor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security footage from the school showed Duncan wearing the scrunchie earlier in the evening. Duncan’s scrunchie, which seemed unusually heavy, revealed a vial of white powder and a cut straw after being examined by two students. These students were quick to inform another teacher, leading to the scrunchie being secured and higher officials in the school being notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frantic-searches-and-failed-drug-tests&quot;&gt;Frantic Searches and Failed Drug Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school’s deputy chief of staff and Evansville Police Chief Tim Alford took Duncan to a nearby clinic for a drug urine screening. Duncan’s first two samples did not reach the required amount or temperature for testing. During a third attempt, police observed an unauthorized collection container falling from Duncan’s shorts. This spurred more suspicion and intensified the investigation into her activities and behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-repercussions-and-community-response&quot;&gt;Legal Repercussions and Community Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan was arrested and booked into the Vanderburgh County Jail, subsequently being released on $1,000 bond under the condition that she attend a drug rehab program.

&lt;p&gt;This incident, though shocking, serves as a reminder to schools and communities about the ongoing battle with drug abuse and the implications it holds, especially in educational environments. It has ignited discussions about vigilance, moral standards, and the safety of students, emphasizing the crucial need for schools to be zones of safety, trust, and ethical integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For schools across the nation, this is a wake-up call, a reminder that the fight against drug abuse is far from over, and the sanctity and safety of educational institutions should be preserved with utmost priority.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The Helfrich Park STEM Academy in Evansville, Indiana, was enshrouded in shock and disbelief as news broke of a teacher, Sarah Duncan, caught with methamphetamine at a school family fun night. Her arrest has spurred conversation and concern amongst parents, teachers, and the wider community, pushing everyone to reassess safety and morality within the institution dedicated to nurturing young minds. A Fun Night Takes a Disturbing Turn Sarah Duncan attended the school’s family fun night event on September 12, with her daughter who is also a student at the academy. What started as an innocent community gathering soon transformed into a situation none could have anticipated. Two students discovered a stash of methamphetamine in a secret compartment of Duncan’s scrunchie, a revelation that led to immediate and swift actions by school officials and the police. Busted - The Unmasking of a Meth Possessor Security footage from the school showed Duncan wearing the scrunchie earlier in the evening. Duncan’s scrunchie, which seemed unusually heavy, revealed a vial of white powder and a cut straw after being examined by two students. These students were quick to inform another teacher, leading to the scrunchie being secured and higher officials in the school being notified. Frantic Searches and Failed Drug Tests The school’s deputy chief of staff and Evansville Police Chief Tim Alford took Duncan to a nearby clinic for a drug urine screening. Duncan’s first two samples did not reach the required amount or temperature for testing. During a third attempt, police observed an unauthorized collection container falling from Duncan’s shorts. This spurred more suspicion and intensified the investigation into her activities and behavioral patterns. Legal Repercussions and Community Response Duncan was arrested and booked into the Vanderburgh County Jail, subsequently being released on $1,000 bond under the condition that she attend a drug rehab program. The school district swiftly responded, firing Duncan the day of her arrest. The repercussions of this event have left a lasting imprint on the school community, leading to broader conversations about substance abuse and the moral responsibilities of educators.

The state’s Republican leadership is spearheading discussions on potentially rejecting federal funds in favor of state funds, intending to maintain control and autonomy in how they educate their youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tennessees-independent-stance&quot;&gt;Tennessee’s Independent Stance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s consideration to sever the federal education funding strings is a significant exemplification of a state opting not to be swayed or confined by the federal government’s mandates. It is in line with Tennessee’s established conservative stance, demonstrating its commitment to prioritizing state values and principles in its governance and legislative processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We, as a state, can lead the nation once again in telling the federal government that they can keep their money, and we’ll just do things the Tennessee way,”&lt;/em&gt; remarked Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, illuminating Tennessee’s resolve to uphold its autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-the-impact&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel, called the Joint Working Group, has been constituted to study the impacts and implications of such a move. Comprising members from both the state House and Senate, this group will delve deep into the possibilities and challenges of state funding replacing federal funding for education, offering insights into whether Tennessee can independently sustain its educational endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crux-of-the-matter&quot;&gt;The Crux of the Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s leadership maintains that the education of Tennessee’s youth is paramount and should not be compromised by the strings attached to federal dollars. These federal funds invariably come laden with various mandates and restrictions, affecting the manner in which education is imparted to the children of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Federal dollars and the various mandates and restrictions that come with those dollars affect the way Tennessee’s children are educated,”&lt;/em&gt; opined Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, emphasizing the crucial nature of this potential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opposition&quot;&gt;The Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this revolutionary proposal has faced opposition, particularly from Democrats who argue that rejecting federal funds may result in “harsh consequences.” They contend that these federal funds are crucial as they support a diverse student base, including those with special needs, English language learners, and students from low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts---tennessees-educational-autonomy-and-federal-funding-independence&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts - Tennessee’s Educational Autonomy and Federal Funding Independence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s contemplation to part ways with federal education funding is a reflection of the state’s desire to carve its path and not be forced into compliance with federal conditions. It stands as a testament to the ongoing tussle between state autonomy and federal influence, with the outcome holding significant implications for the future of education funding and state-federal relations in the United States. Whether Tennessee will indeed choose the path of independence and manage education the “Tennessee way” remains to be seen, but the discussions underway are pivotal for the state’s educational landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a bold move that epitomizes the spirit of state autonomy, Tennessee is contemplating a decisive step away from federal education funding.

Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden’s re-election bid under financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blow-to-campaign-projections&quot;&gt;A Blow to Campaign Projections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden’s campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;waiting-on-bidens-blessing&quot;&gt;Waiting on Biden’s Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tentative-agreements-and-ongoing-strikes&quot;&gt;Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers’ strike as early as October. However, actors remain steadfast, continuing their strike and resulting in a dearth of celebrity fundraising events, leaving the Democrats to face the financial music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-hollywood-stars-lend-their-support-again&quot;&gt;Will Hollywood Stars Lend Their Support Again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s support was instrumental in the Biden-Harris ticket success in 2020. Celebrities threw millions at the candidates, painting the town blue. However, with Biden’s popularity plummeting amidst rising inflation and an escalating crisis at the border, Hollywood’s loyalty and financial support appear shaky at best. With the current situation labeled as toxic, the speculation is whether Hollywood stars will publicly support Biden’s campaign again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prolonged-aftermath&quot;&gt;Prolonged Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes continue to pose extensive repercussions for Democrats. As one Southern California Democratic strategist mentions, it was a “massive earthquake with prolonged aftershocks expected for months still.” Biden and the Democrats seem to be caught in a tempest with dwindling support from a crucial sector, raising the question of whether they can navigate through these turbulent times successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game of politics where financial backing can sometimes dictate the sway of power, the impact of the Hollywood strikes on Democratic coffers is evident.

This incident occurs amid revelations of his team’s vigorous efforts to shield him from potential falls. The almost fall and preventative measures by his team to secure his stability raise crucial questions about his physical fitness and, by extension, his ability to lead the nation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-near-miss-on-air-force-one&quot;&gt;A Near Miss on Air Force One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to Michigan, as Biden exited Air Force One, he experienced a loss of balance around the eighth step but managed to regain it swiftly, avoiding a complete tumble. It’s crucial to consider the serious implications such incidents can have on the public’s perception of his leadership capacity, particularly in the heat of an election season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lingering-health-concerns&quot;&gt;Lingering Health Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Biden was diagnosed with significant spinal arthritis by the White House physician, following which he has encountered multiple stumbling incidents. These incidents inevitably introduce speculations regarding his age and his fitness to serve as president, sparking debates across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventative-measures-in-place&quot;&gt;Preventative Measures in Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to such issues, Biden’s campaign team is reportedly taking precautionary measures, including having him wear tennis shoes and curtailing his stair climbs to prevent any more embarrassing and potentially harmful falls. Despite these efforts, the ongoing incidents lead to increased scrutiny and pose a potentially detrimental impact on his reputation and ability to govern effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-perception--presidential-fitness&quot;&gt;Public Perception &amp;amp; Presidential Fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public opinion plays a pivotal role in determining the political trajectory of a leader. A majority of the populace, as indicated by recent polls, already believes that Biden’s age might be a significant hindrance to his ability to effectively serve for another term. A staggering 77% of the population in a recent Associated Press poll believe Biden is too old to be effective for four more years, including 69% of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calls-for-change-within-the-party&quot;&gt;Calls for Change Within the Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notable concern within the Democratic party is evident, with three out of five Democrats preferring a different nominee for the 2024 elections, according to a recent poll from the Washington Post and ABC News. This emerging inclination within the party underscores the pervasive apprehensions regarding Biden’s capability to lead the nation, rooted in his recurrent physical instabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-stability-leadership-paradigm&quot;&gt;The Stability-Leadership Paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s physical stability, or lack thereof, is becoming emblematic of his leadership stability. His competency is being critically evaluated in light of these age-related incidents, and many wonder if these instances of physical instability are reflective of his ability to lead a nation. The need for a leader who can exhibit steadfastness, both physically and in policy-making, is crucial in navigating the country through tumultuous times, and Biden’s recent incidents bring his capability to do so into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Biden’s team is making concerted efforts to prevent any further incidents that could portray the President in a less favorable light, the age-related physical instabilities continue to be a subject of national debate. It’s imperative that the leader of the free world embodies strength, stability, and assurance.
