A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">The Resilient Half-Jawed Gator - New Star Attraction at Gatorland</title><link href="/news/2023/09/17/Resilient-Gator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Resilient Half-Jawed Gator - New Star Attraction at Gatorland" /><published>2023-09-17T11:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-17T11:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/17/Resilient-Gator</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/17/Resilient-Gator/">&lt;p&gt;Alligators have been a key part of Florida’s wildlife for eons, but a recent discovery of a half-jawed gator has captured the nation’s attention. This unique reptile’s story of survival has now earned it a home at Gatorland Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-survivors-tale&quot;&gt;A Survivor’s Tale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t every day you come across an alligator missing half of its upper jaw. When local resident Eustacia Kanter spotted the young reptile in Sanford, even she had trouble processing what she was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At first, my brain couldn’t comprehend that its entire upper jaw was missing,” recounted Kanter. Once the initial shock wore off, her compassion kicked in. Kanter promptly captured a photo from a safe distance, aiming to share it with those who might offer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-wild-to-safe-haven&quot;&gt;From Wild to Safe Haven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter’s initiative led her to contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and an environmental conservation nonprofit. The goal? Find and safely rescue this rare gator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alligator, believed to be between four to five years old, managed to avoid capture for several weeks, displaying a level of resilience that is truly awe-inspiring. It’s estimated that this fighter had been living in the wild in its present condition for at least six months, subsisting mainly on smaller prey like snails and frogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspected cause of the gator’s injury is a boat’s engine propeller. Despite the drastic injury, the creature’s vitality remains intact. “Alligators and crocodiles are amazing survivors,” emphasized Savannah Boan from Gatorland. “They can survive almost anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-home&quot;&gt;A New Home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reptile, which made national headlines due to its unique condition, has found a comfortable new abode at Gatorland Orlando. Officials have mentioned that it will remain separated from other animals initially and be placed on a special diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’s a little bit skinny, but she looks to be pretty healthy and feisty,” Boan observed, expressing optimism about the gator’s future at the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;got-a-name-in-mind&quot;&gt;Got a Name in Mind?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of this incredible survivor is still unfolding, and now, Gatorland is inviting the public to contribute. They are encouraging people to suggest names for this distinctive gator via the park’s social media channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many, this gator represents the epitome of resilience. It’s a testament to the fact that even when faced with the harshest of life’s trials, with a little help and a lot of spirit, one can find a way to not just survive, but thrive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Alligators have been a key part of Florida’s wildlife for eons, but a recent discovery of a half-jawed gator has captured the nation’s attention.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, eyeing the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, showed his backing for Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who’s actively blocked multiple military appointments. Why? He’s protesting the Pentagon’s abortion policy which was introduced earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence firmly stated his views during a speech on Friday. “Sen. Tommy Tuberville is right, and the Pentagon is wrong,” Pence declared, committing to halt taxpayer dollars from undermining pro-life laws if he takes office. Tuberville’s stance, however, has led to a six-month holdup in the Senate, affecting over 300 pending military promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest also means that Army, Marine Corps, and Navy leaders are currently in interim positions, which curtails their authority. This occurs because of the Senate’s delay in confirming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the Pentagon’s policy that’s causing this ripple? They’ve pledged to cover the travel costs for service members either seeking abortions or supporting their spouses during such procedures. This policy allows up to five months, or 20 weeks into a pregnancy, for service members to inform their departments and ask for travel assistance for these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Pence is not alone in his support for Tuberville. Other Republicans have also echoed similar sentiments. Nevertheless, there’s also criticism from both sides of the aisle and the military. For instance, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, critiqued Tuberville’s strategy, saying, “holding these non-policymaking career military [officials] is a mistake.” Similarly, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, pointed out the national security risks, stating Tuberville’s holds are “paralyzing the Department of Defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence, who’s been vocal about his anti-abortion stance, was the first 2024 presidential candidate to back a 15-week national abortion ban. He stated, “I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it,” emphasizing his commitment to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hold on promotions doesn’t sit well with many. Inside sources claim it compromises national security and might even push those awaiting promotions to look for jobs outside the military. A joint op-ed by the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force emphasized the negative impact, stating, “Any claim that holding up the promotions of top officers does not directly damage the military is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mounting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, recent polls among Alabama voters suggest that the majority would prefer Tuberville to end his block on military promotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Pentagon’s abortion policy has stirred controversy, and now it’s influencing military promotions.

It’s all about celebrities pairing up with pro dancers to show off their moves. But recently, one choice of celebrity has many people, including former DWTS pro dancer Sharna Burgess, feeling a bit upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speaking-out-loud&quot;&gt;Speaking Out Loud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharna Burgess used her podcast, “Old-ish”, to share her thoughts. She was really surprised when she found out that Adrian Peterson, a famous football player, was joining the new season of “Dancing with the Stars.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why?” you might ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in 2014, Peterson was in big trouble. He got charged with child abuse. He had used a switch (a thin tree branch) to spank his young son, who was only four years old at that time. The child had lots of cuts and bruises. Later, in 2018, Peterson said in an interview that he still uses a belt to punish his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Burgess, this was really hard to hear. She said, “The man has been charged with child abuse… and that is just devastating for me.” She even mentioned that if she were still on the show and got paired up with Peterson, she would just leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-troubles&quot;&gt;Other Troubles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Peterson had another problem. He was arrested at an airport. There was a report that he and his wife, Ashley, had a big argument on a plane. However, later, the couple shared happy news: they were expecting their third child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many fans of “Dancing with the Stars” are not happy with Peterson joining the show. When they found out he’d be dancing with pro dancer Britt Stewart, lots of them went online to share their feelings. Britt’s Instagram account got many negative comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-all-this-matters&quot;&gt;Why All This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story shows us how choices made by TV shows can stir feelings and debates. Some people think that Peterson should get a second chance. Others feel that his past actions should keep him off the show. It’s a reminder that the world of entertainment is not just about fun and games; it can also spark important discussions about right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">“Dancing with the Stars” is a show many people love.

Auto workers, the force behind every vehicle rolling out of factories, are calling for a wage increase. And the reason is simple – the looming specter of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-call-for-fair-wages&quot;&gt;The Call for Fair Wages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, auto workers have weathered economic storms, often making concessions for the greater good. During the government bailout era, they forfeited significant portions of their salaries and pension benefits, ensuring the survival of the auto industry at a time when it faced potential bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with the auto industry navigating a transition to electric vehicles and the rise of robotics threatening traditional jobs, workers are rallying for a 40% wage increase. While this figure might appear daunting at first glance, they justify this as a “catch-up” move, citing massive profit margins for the industry and lucrative pay packages for CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-inflation-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Inflation Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation, often described as the silent thief, has played a significant role in the current wage debate. As NBC’s Brian Cheung points out, America has grappled with unprecedented inflation rates unseen in over four decades. While wages in the automotive sector have seen a 14-15% surge since the last contract negotiation in 2019, inflation rates have overshadowed this growth with an 18% rise in prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the earnings of auto workers haven’t paced with inflation. The figures elucidate a narrative of wages that lag behind the skyrocketing costs of living. With contract renegotiations occurring roughly every four years, workers are keen on securing a deal that reflects the financial realities of today’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-road-ahead&quot;&gt;A Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As negotiations progress, it’s crucial to recognize the unique challenges auto workers face. Balancing the transition to sustainable transportation, the advent of robotics, and economic inflation is no small task. The coming weeks will undoubtedly be pivotal in determining the trajectory of wages and, by extension, the well-being of countless individuals in the auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amid the bustling noise of machinery and the hum of production lines, a wave of concern is growing among the backbone of America’s auto industry.

He firmly believes that no candidate should automatically get a nomination. Everyone has to earn their spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a chat on the “America Reports” show on Fox News, DeSantis spoke about his game plan. He believes his campaign is ready to go the distance.

A man, wanted in Ohio for murder, had broken into their home. Little did he realize, the homeowner was prepared and determined to protect his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-invasion&quot;&gt;The Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael James Brooks II, known for his involvement in a series of crimes including a fatal stabbing in Ohio, broke into a residence in Georgia. However, the family man of the house was ready. Armed with a firearm and keen instincts, he confronted Brooks, who was wielding a knife, in his basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon spotting the intruder, the homeowner didn’t immediately resort to force. He issued a warning to Brooks. But as events escalated, he had to fire two shots to defend himself and his family. This quick thinking and bravery potentially saved multiple lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prompt-police-response&quot;&gt;Prompt Police Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fayette County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) was alerted to the situation by a security alarm triggered at the house. With deputies just three minutes away, the homeowner made a strategic move. He took a defensive position on the second-floor staircase, preparing for any possible confrontation as Brooks made his way upwards. By the time the police arrived, Brooks had sustained two gunshot wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks is currently in medical care. Once released, he is set to face a series of charges including burglary, home invasion, and theft in Georgia, along with murder charges in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots&quot;&gt;Connecting The Dots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection between Brooks and the crime scene was made clear when a Ford truck, reported stolen from Kettering, Ohio, was found outside the burglarized home in Georgia. It was this lead that confirmed Brooks’ involvement. The vehicle had plates different from the original, indicating a possible attempt to conceal his tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators also believe that Brooks might have approached several homes in the Georgia neighborhood before zeroing in on the residence he invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-glimpse-into-brooks-past&quot;&gt;A Glimpse into Brooks’ Past&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Columbus Division of Police identified Brooks as the main suspect in another home invasion that resulted in the tragic death of 77-year-old Emily Foster. This invasion took place in the city’s University District on September 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact motivations and means by which Brooks moved from Ohio to Georgia remain a matter of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident, though harrowing, stands as a testament to the importance of being prepared.

A man, wanted in Ohio for murder, had broken into their home. Little did he realize, the homeowner was prepared and determined to protect his loved ones. The Invasion Michael James Brooks II, known for his involvement in a series of crimes including a fatal stabbing in Ohio, broke into a residence in Georgia. However, the family man of the house was ready. Armed with a firearm and keen instincts, he confronted Brooks, who was wielding a knife, in his basement. Upon spotting the intruder, the homeowner didn’t immediately resort to force. He issued a warning to Brooks. But as events escalated, he had to fire two shots to defend himself and his family. This quick thinking and bravery potentially saved multiple lives. Prompt Police Response The Fayette County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) was alerted to the situation by a security alarm triggered at the house. With deputies just three minutes away, the homeowner made a strategic move. He took a defensive position on the second-floor staircase, preparing for any possible confrontation as Brooks made his way upwards. By the time the police arrived, Brooks had sustained two gunshot wounds. Brooks is currently in medical care.

This incident sheds light on Mexico’s escalating challenges related to migrants and their perilous journey towards the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomatic-plea-for-help&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Plea for Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue was initiated after the Iranian Embassy in Mexico City reached out to local authorities, reporting that several Iranian citizens had been abducted within the city. Even after the victims’ families complied with the ransom demands, the captors failed to release them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting on the information, Mexican law enforcement swiftly pinpointed a stash house located in the Venustiano Carranza borough. The subsequent raid led to the apprehension of one man and three women, all of Venezuelan origin, responsible for the crime. Rescued from the confinement were three Iranian women, one Iranian man, an adult male, and a child, both from Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing their operation, the police soon arrested two women, recognized as Mexican citizens, who were alleged proprietors of the property used for holding the victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-worrying-trend&quot;&gt;A Worrying Trend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though authorities have yet to disclose specifics about the kidnapping or the ransom sum, this incident aligns with a distressing pattern emerging in Mexico. As the country grapples with an immigration crisis, cases of migrant abductions are on the rise. These unfortunate travelers often become pawns in the hands of human smuggling rings, who exploit their vulnerable state. The families of these migrants are then coerced into paying ransoms to ensure the safety and continuation of their loved ones’ perilous journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more migrants attempt to cross into the U.S., Mexico faces an arduous task in ensuring their safety and curbing these illicit activities. The recent rescue operation stands testament to their commitment, but also highlights the looming challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a daring operation this week, Mexico City authorities successfully rescued four Iranian citizens and two Ecuadoran migrants who were held captive and ransomed.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loyal-ties-and-big-money&quot;&gt;Loyal Ties and Big Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A billionaire in his own right, Johnson’s relationship with the former president Trump is well-documented. Not only a longstanding friend but also a staunch supporter, Johnson reportedly approached numerous Republican billionaires, advocating for their backing of Trump’s campaign. As reported by CNBC, insiders privy to the matter reveal the essence of Johnson’s appeal: it’s high time to support Trump as he is poised to be the nominee, judging by the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all have been eager to jump onboard the ‘Trump Train’. Prominent figures such as Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, steel tycoon Andy Sabin, and real estate magnate Stephen Ross have expressed reservations, with some pointing to the U.S. Capitol riot in January 2021 as a significant deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;momentum-in-numbers&quot;&gt;Momentum in Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be overshadowed by the reluctance of some, Johnson himself has made a hefty contribution of $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. As controversies encircle Trump, there’s a surprising twist. Trump’s popularity among the Republican voter base has witnessed a notable uptick. A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicates that nearly 63% of Republicans are in favor of Trump making another presidential run. This figure marks an increase from 55% earlier this year. Moreover, Trump’s favorable opinion ratings among Republicans are up, currently standing at 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this surge within the party might not be sufficient in a broader electoral landscape. Trump’s challengers from within the GOP suggest that while he might be revered within the party, winning a general election – where reaching beyond the GOP base is vital – might remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will determine if Johnson’s efforts will lead to a successful touchdown for Trump or if they will face an interception by the larger electorate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amidst the political storm, Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets and former American ambassador to Britain, emerges as a pivotal figure rallying major donors for Donald Trump’s potential presidential bid.

Amidst the clamor, two potential pathways to replacing Biden have emerged, though the clock is ticking rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-primary-path---will-a-challenger-rise&quot;&gt;The Primary Path - Will a Challenger Rise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every election year, the Democratic party gears up for its primary election process, a tried and tested system to choose the most suitable candidate for the general elections. Between January to June next year, Democrats will be flocking to polling booths across the nation to cast their vote for a presidential nominee. The early indications? Biden is in for a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Marianne Williamson have already thrown their hats in the ring. However, the majority of Democratic voters remain unconvinced by their candidacy. The real game-changer would be if a well-established, broadly appealing candidate were to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin Newsom, California’s Governor, seems poised to fill that role. His recent actions - touring Republican states, advocating for national gun control referendums, and even challenging Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for a Fox News debate - have elevated his profile, making him a strong contender. But is the Biden camp worried? Publicly, they see Newsom as a valued associate. Privately, rumors paint a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Newsom isn’t the only name generating buzz. Michigan’s popular governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Pete Buttigieg, the current Transportation Secretary who ran for the presidency in 2020, are also considered potential contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline clock, however, is ticking. States have specific deadlines for candidates to declare their intention to run, with Nevada setting the earliest deadline on October 15th. By the end of the year, 14 more states will have set their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-convention-conundrum---can-biden-step-down&quot;&gt;The Convention Conundrum - Can Biden Step Down?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second pathway for Biden’s potential replacement lies within the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August next year. Here, Biden has a card to play. Even if he clinches the majority of delegate votes, he has the option to withdraw his candidacy. Should he choose to do this, the convention would turn into a free-for-all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Democratic party guidelines, while pledged delegates aren’t obligated to vote for the candidate they initially supported, they are expected to “reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” A Biden endorsement could be a game-changer in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this isn’t without complications. A “contested” convention, where no candidate gets a majority, could devolve into chaos, showcasing a fractured party just months before the general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-historical-challenge&quot;&gt;A Historical Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the annals of modern political history, an incumbent president has never been ousted from his party’s nomination during a re-election bid. The last time a convention even neared “contested” status was back in 1980 for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any potential candidate willing to challenge Biden’s nomination, the road ahead is filled with historical precedence and procedural challenges. With the clock rapidly winding down, the Democratic party faces an unprecedented choice as 2024 looms on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">With the 2024 presidential primaries on the horizon, a rising tide of voices within the Democratic party is debating the viability of President Biden as their candidate for a second term.
