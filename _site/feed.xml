A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">NRA Derides Biden’s Effort – Gun Control or Power Play?</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/01/Biden-Mocked-by-NRA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NRA Derides Biden’s Effort – Gun Control or Power Play?" /><published>2023-10-01T11:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T11:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/01/Biden-Mocked-by-NRA</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/01/Biden-Mocked-by-NRA/">&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s recent establishment of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention has sparked contentious debates and drawn mockery from the National Rifle Association (NRA). This development underscores the friction between the administration’s efforts to curtail gun violence and the NRA’s staunch defense of Second Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mockery-in-the-midst-of-serious-debate&quot;&gt;Mockery in the Midst of Serious Debate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s initiative, although touted as an imperative move to mitigate gun violence, has been scoffed at by the NRA as merely a masquerade for the president’s true intentions. The NRA even satirically suggested renaming the office to the “Federal Office to Disarm Law-Abiding Americans and Defeat the NRA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stefanie-feldmana-bias-revealed&quot;&gt;Stefanie Feldman—A Bias Revealed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Stefanie Feldman as the director of this newly minted office seems to underscore the NRA’s concerns. Feldman’s extensive social media history portrays her antagonistic stance against the NRA, with numerous posts conveying her resolve to defeat the organization and implement stringent gun control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-closer-scrutiny-of-intentions&quot;&gt;A Closer Scrutiny of Intentions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new office, although ostensibly established to “send a clear message” about the significance of gun violence prevention, appears to be more of a political maneuver than a genuine attempt to address the underlying issues. The high-profile criticisms, mainly from the NRA, question whether this move is an altruistic pursuit to enhance public safety or a calculated strategy to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding gun owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kamala-harrisanother-piece-in-the-puzzle&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris—Another Piece in the Puzzle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris, a significant proponent of stringent gun control, reinforces the suspicion surrounding the administration’s motives. Her emphatic support for banning “assault weapons” and her applaud for Biden’s previous stands on gun control exemplify the administration’s broader agenda to constrain gun rights, which is perceived by critics as being incongruent with the principles of the Second Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-concealed-agenda&quot;&gt;A Concealed Agenda?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the administration asserts that the establishment of this office exemplifies President Biden’s commitment to making communities safer, critics argue that it seems to be a diversionary tactic. The NRA contends that Biden is leveraging gun control to distract from other pressing issues, labeling the perceived rise in crime under his administration as the “Biden Crime Wave.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-underlying-question&quot;&gt;The Underlying Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s controversial move raises the fundamental question: Is the creation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention a genuine endeavor to safeguard American lives, or is it a well-orchestrated strategy, marked by bias and a possible encroachment on the constitutional rights of Americans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfolding narrative around this debate elucidates the entrenched ideological disparities and questions the sincerity behind the administration’s gun control initiatives. It remains to be seen whether this office will contribute meaningfully to public safety or will simply serve as a symbolic representation of the administration’s contentious stance on gun rights.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">President Biden’s recent establishment of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention has sparked contentious debates and drawn mockery from the National Rifle Association (NRA).

This vocalization comes amid the unfolding political and socio-economic scenario in the United States under President Joe Biden. The legendary singer has not only grabbed the spotlight but has also initiated a discourse around the concept of freedom and the future of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonos-bold-statements&quot;&gt;Bono’s Bold Statements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview with Britain’s Channel 4, Bono discussed his viewpoints on freedom and the current state of America, emphasizing his hope that America will rise above its present condition. However, he conspicuously refrained from mentioning any names, including that of President Joe Biden and his predecessor, referred to as the “T-word,” or Donald Trump, showing a subtle yet strategic approach to expressing his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-passion-for-freedom&quot;&gt;A Passion for Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono has been outspoken about his political views and has always been a fervent advocate for freedom and human rights. “I’m attracted to freedom,” Bono said during the interview, highlighting the importance of showcasing what freedom truly embodies. Bono’s articulation on freedom rings particularly significant at a time when the world is grappling with complex political landscapes and debates on democracy and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tense-political-scenario&quot;&gt;A Tense Political Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono’s comments reflect the tense and uncertain political environment prevailing in the United States, characterized by the divide between different political ideologies and values. The country is currently experiencing intense debates and disagreements on numerous issues, including immigration, economic policies, and international relations. These controversies have led to a renewed reflection on democracy and its principles, sparking discussions on the inherent values of inclusion and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-edge-on-democracy&quot;&gt;The Edge on Democracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interview, The Edge, Bono’s fellow bandmate from U2, also shared his views on the ongoing crisis in democracy. He emphasized the prevailing existential crisis democracy faces and criticized those questioning the principles of inclusion and freedom, particularly in America. These comments underscore the broader concerns about the erosion of democratic values and the rise of authoritarian ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-call-to-reflect&quot;&gt;A Call to Reflect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono and The Edge’s statements are more than mere expressions of personal opinions. They are a call to reflect on the essential values that form the foundation of society and democracy. They invite a deeper consideration of the principles of freedom, inclusion, and democratic governance, urging individuals and communities to evaluate and uphold these ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono’s articulation of America being at a “low ebb” is more than a mere comment. It is an observation and a reflection on the prevailing conditions in America and the wider world. It calls for introspection on the part of individuals, societies, and nations regarding the values they hold dear and the kind of world they wish to create and live in. As these conversations unfold, the role of iconic figures like Bono in shaping public opinion and fostering dialogue on critical issues becomes increasingly evident, illuminating the intertwined paths of art, expression, and politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">U2’s iconic frontman, Bono, has recently made headlines by describing America as being at a “low ebb,” sparking conversations about the current political climate, freedom, and democracy.

Her claim implies a significant level of concern within the party, fearing the repercussions that may ensue should the details come to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dodging-accountability&quot;&gt;Dodging Accountability?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne’s bold accusations suggest that the Democrats are afraid and attempting to “poo-poo” substantial evidence to keep it away from the public eye. “The last thing they want is this information out there,” she mentioned during her appearance on “Saturday Agenda,” implicating a deliberate attempt to hinder transparency and avoid potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unveiling-the-alleged-chain-of-events&quot;&gt;Unveiling the Alleged Chain of Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne referenced the release of about “700 pages” of documents by the House Ways and Means Committee last week related to the inquiry. According to her, the documents portray a clear narrative where Hunter Biden would acquire foreign clients who, upon facing trouble, would be assisted by his father, Joe Biden, during his tenure as vice president. This alleged intervention would subsequently result in millions flowing into Hunter Biden’s accounts and the companies he’s associated with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raising-critical-questions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising Critical Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This purported chain of actions has sparked a series of critical questions, with Van Duyne emphasizing the necessity to determine how much of the acquired money was used to settle bills for Joe Biden and to what extent he was actively involved in manipulating U.S. policies to accommodate requests from these foreign entities. “Not only did he have dinner with these people, but he actually manipulated US policy to be able to fulfill their requests,” Van Duyne alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;highlighting-the-importance-of-inquiry&quot;&gt;Highlighting the Importance of Inquiry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Duyne stressed the importance of the ongoing inquiry, declaring that unveiling the truth is pivotal to holding the involved parties accountable. She argued that the inquiry is essential to determine whether Joe Biden had indeed leveraged his position to manipulate U.S. policy and fulfill requests from foreign clients associated with his son, thus raising serious concerns over the integrity of his actions while in office.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this a case of progressive evolution, or is it eroding the traditional foundations and unity of the naval forces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;woke-tides---a-naval-transformation&quot;&gt;‘Woke’ Tides - A Naval Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy has adopted a so-called “inclusive” approach, encouraging sailors to use gender pronouns during introductions. Detailed in their “Trans and Non-Binary Awareness” guide, the policy seeks to embrace the various expressions of gender identity including “pangender,” “gender neutral,” and “two-spirit.” While promoted under the banner of inclusivity and respect, some view it as an imposition of “woke” ideology, questioning its impact on the naval ethos and operational cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wokeness-dilemma---progress-or-decay&quot;&gt;The ‘Wokeness’ Dilemma - Progress or Decay?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of such “woke” policies raises essential questions about the true nature of progress. Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, expressed concerns about potential divisions, questioning whether such policies might compromise the cohesion and combative efficacy of the Navy. Is the Royal Navy being steered by the currents of political correctness, possibly at the expense of its core values and duties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideological-currents---beyond-gender&quot;&gt;Ideological Currents - Beyond Gender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “wokeness” doesn’t stop at gender pronouns. The Royal Navy is also propagating contentious concepts such as “white privilege” and “intersectionality,” focusing on societal aspects of an individual’s identity like race, class, and gender, and their interconnected impacts on discrimination and privilege. While the intent might be to foster equality and mutual respect, the implementation of such ideologically charged concepts can be seen as polarizing and detrimental to unit harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;operational-integrity---balancing-act&quot;&gt;Operational Integrity - Balancing Act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of such radical policies, maintaining operational integrity while promoting diversity seems like a tightrope walk. The implementation of these “woke” guidelines is critical to understanding the deeper implications on organizational unity and the morale of the personnel. Are these policies truly fostering respect and understanding, or are they sowing seeds of discord among the naval ranks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defence-and-wokeness---a-mismatched-alliance&quot;&gt;Defence and ‘Wokeness’ - A Mismatched Alliance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence insists that the Royal Navy’s chief concern is to safeguard the UK and its interests. However, the introduction of such ideological guidelines seems to blur the line between maintaining operational readiness and pursuing societal progressivism. Is ‘wokeness’ overshadowing the Navy’s fundamental duties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigating-the-woke-seas---the-way-forward&quot;&gt;Navigating the ‘Woke’ Seas - The Way Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Royal Navy’s pursuit of “wokeness” highlights the ongoing societal struggle between traditional values and progressive ideals.

The severe reactions from his peers and the call for investigations by Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, underline the gravity of this seemingly reckless act and hint at deep-rooted implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bowmans-shaky-clarification&quot;&gt;Bowman’s Shaky Clarification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s attempt to clarify the situation did little to dispel the rising doubts and suspicions. His chief of staff, Sarah Iddrissu, expressed Bowman’s regret over any ensuing confusion, suggesting that it was a mere misunderstanding. “The Congressman did not realize he would trigger a building alarm… The Congressman regrets any confusion,” she tried to clarify. However, such an excuse seems rather thin, considering the sensitivity and the seriousness of the surroundings he operates in daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s own explanation did not fare much better, as he stated that he thought the alarm would open a door. “I didn’t mean to cause confusion… I didn’t know I was going to trip the whole building. I thought it would help me open the door,” he said to the reporters. This seemingly naïve justification, coming from a seasoned legislator, has only fueled further speculation regarding his real motives and raised questions about his competence and understanding of the protocols of the legislative building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;echoes-of-condemnation&quot;&gt;Echoes of Condemnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of Bowman’s act were quickly met with stern words and outright condemnation from his colleagues, like Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who termed the act as “potentially criminal” and “absolutely outrageous.” Lawler went a step further, suggesting that such shameful and unbecoming act demands Bowman’s resignation from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

His shallow justifications and the critical timing of the event have left many unconvinced about the innocence of his actions. This incident stands as a stark reminder of the thinning lines of trust and the rising tensions within the legislative chambers, posing crucial questions about the caliber and the ethical standards of our representatives.

Four human smugglers, associated with Mexico’s notorious Gulf Cartel, have pleaded guilty to causing fatal incidents in Texas, highlighting the perilous and often tragic journeys migrants undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-shadows--operations-unveiled&quot;&gt;Behind the Shadows – Operations Unveiled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Manuel Tena, Julia Isairis Torres, Israel Torres, and Jose Refugio Torres have admitted their guilt in two fatal smuggling attempts that resulted in the deaths of eight migrants. Tena, characterized as the mastermind behind these operations, has been actively recruiting individuals and coordinating smuggling efforts, profiting off the vulnerability of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scenes-of-despair--the-incidents&quot;&gt;Scenes of Despair – The Incidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smugglers were responsible for moving migrants from Rio Grande Valley to Houston in March 2019 when their vehicle overturned, killing four migrants and injuring several. Another tragedy struck in February 2022, when a boat transporting migrants from South Padre Island to Corpus Christi capsized near Port Mansfield, causing the death of four migrants and a smuggler, with two more severely injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guilt-and-consequence--verdicts-awaited&quot;&gt;Guilt and Consequence – Verdicts Awaited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involved individuals have pleaded guilty to several charges related to human smuggling conspiracies resulting in death. Tena will forfeit various properties in South Texas, procured through the profits of human smuggling. The three other accomplices, Julia, Israel, and Jose Torres, pleaded guilty to their involvement in the 2019 case. Meanwhile, two other suspects in the 2022 incident are still awaiting trial. The sentencing in December may see each accused facing a life term in prison for their appalling acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unseen-victims--the-human-cost&quot;&gt;Unseen Victims – The Human Cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ordeal reflects the enormous human cost related to illegal border crossings and human smuggling. The victims are often those desperate for a chance at a better life, only to find themselves entangled in a dangerous web of criminal operations. The impact of these incidents is vast, touching the lives of families who lose their loved ones and communities grappling with the consequences of such tragic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;international-spotlight--border-tensions&quot;&gt;International Spotlight – Border Tensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the U.S.-Mexico border constantly in international headlines due to the unprecedented number of illegal crossings, these incidents underscore the urgency of addressing the deeper issues at play. They point to a pressing need for comprehensive immigration reforms and enhanced border security measures to curb such calamities and ensure the safety and well-being of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acknowledgement of guilt by the cartel-connected smugglers sheds light on the dangerous, often deadly circumstances surrounding illegal border crossings. It’s a stark reminder of the human suffering and tragedy embedded in the pursuit of a better life and the profound need for transformative solutions to the longstanding issues at the border. The ramifications of such incidents call for immediate, sustained, and thoughtful action, addressing the root causes and providing safe, lawful pathways for those seeking refuge and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A harrowing episode has unfolded at the U.S.-Mexico border, revealing a grim reality of cross-border crimes and their devastating repercussions.

Duane “Keffe D” Davis, the only surviving witness, has been indicted in connection with the murder. This news reignites the legacy of Tupac, shedding new light on his untimely demise and leaving fans and followers both stunned and vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shocking-arrest&quot;&gt;Shocking Arrest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Davis, also known as “Keffe D,” was arrested near his home, leading to shockwaves across the music industry and fans globally. The indictment on the charge of open murder, with the use of a deadly weapon along with a gang enhancement, reveals the layers and depths to this case that have kept it unresolved for decades. The pivotal arrest occurred as Davis, 60, was on a walk, leaving the public in anticipation for what’s next in this twist-filled saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revelations-from-the-past&quot;&gt;Revelations from the Past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis had long been on the radar of investigators. He admitted in his 2019 tell-all memoir, “Compton Street Legend,” that he was present in the Cadillac during the infamous September 1996 drive-by shooting that led to Tupac’s death. Davis’s admissions, along with his media statements, have reinvigorated the investigation, giving hope to those who seek justice for Tupac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legacy-continues&quot;&gt;Legacy Continues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his untimely death at just 25, Tupac Shakur remains one of the most influential figures in the hip-hop community. His fourth solo record, “All Eyez on Me,” was topping the charts at the time of his death, with about 5 million copies sold. Tupac’s enduring influence and the continuous love from fans show the undying nature of his artistry and his impact on the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gang-connections-and-controversies&quot;&gt;Gang Connections and Controversies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gang connections in this case have always fueled controversies and theories regarding Tupac’s murder. Davis claimed in an interview that everyone present in the Cadillac on the night of the murder was a member of the South Side Compton Crips gang. This gang was reportedly on the lookout for Tupac, who had allegedly brawled with a member in the hours leading up to his fatal shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evidence-seizure-and-further-investigations&quot;&gt;Evidence Seizure and Further Investigations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities have seized multiple items from Davis’s residence, including electronic devices and copies of “Compton Street Legends,” in the hope of finding more clues and information pertaining to Tupac’s murder. The evidence seized during the raid corroborates information previously collected during the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-on-fans-and-the-industry&quot;&gt;The Impact on Fans and the Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indictment has reignited discussions and reflections on Tupac’s life and his contribution to music and culture. Fans, music aficionados, and industry peers are closely watching the developments, seeking closure to one of the most painful and iconic moments in music history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this case are vast, impacting not just the music industry, but also reflecting on the societal and cultural dimensions of the 1990s, offering a closer look into the life and struggles of one of the most impactful artists of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough is a reminder of the enduring influence of Tupac Shakur, and the quest for truth and justice in his case represents the collective hope to preserve and honor his legacy.

The RHSA brings forth the promise of a law that is both constitutional and democratic, establishing an interstate compact to create uniform rules governing medication control and racetrack safety in horse racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-closed-doors---hisas-unpopularity&quot;&gt;Behind Closed Doors - HISA’s Unpopularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act (HISA) is marred by secrecy and lack of consensus from the industry players. Its implementation, according to many, threatens to oust small businesses from the horseracing industry by burdening them with $66 million in regulatory costs. This act, despite its avowed goal to enact nationwide rules for racetrack safety and anti-doping, has met with substantial disapproval for its heavy-handed approach and alleged unconstitutionality, which is seen as giving federal power to a private entity without adequate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-rhsa---a-beacon-of-reform&quot;&gt;The Rise of RHSA - A Beacon of Reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to HISA’s perceived failures, Republican attorneys general have thrown their support behind the Racehorse Health and Safety Act (RHSA), proposed by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA). The RHSA promises to be more inclusive, allowing contributions from various industry entities, focusing on established scientific principles and methodologies. Advocates believe that this act will be significantly less costly as it plans to utilize existing state resources, enabling states to either enforce RHSO rules or allow RHSO to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-of-principles---science-vs-public-perception&quot;&gt;A Battle of Principles - Science vs Public Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical difference between HISA and RHSA lies in their foundational principles. The former is perceived to have rules grounded more in public perception, which failed to prevent numerous racehorse deaths at Churchill Downs, while the latter promises to base its rules on generally accepted scientific principles, focusing on the health and welfare of racehorses. The support for RHSA from entities like the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and the United States Trotting Association reinforces its commitment to sound veterinary science and industry inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to endorse RHSA by several state attorneys general reflects a broader push for reform in the horse racing industry, based on transparency, accountability, and scientific grounding. It promises to be a democratic and constitutional law that gives a voice to everyone in the industry and stands in stark contrast to HISA’s alleged clandestine development and unilateral imposition.
