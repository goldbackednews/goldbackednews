A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/17/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-17T12:20:46-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-17T12:20:46-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/17/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/17/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Brussels Terror Alert Soars as Swedes Gunned Down</title><link href="/news/2023/10/17/Terror-Alert-Brussels/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brussels Terror Alert Soars as Swedes Gunned Down" /><published>2023-10-17T11:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-17T11:25:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/17/Terror-Alert-Brussels</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/17/Terror-Alert-Brussels/">&lt;p&gt;Brussels was rocked with fear and anxiety as two Swedish nationals were ruthlessly shot on a day when football enthusiasts from Belgium and Sweden were eagerly anticipating their clash on the pitch. As the city braced for the soccer matchup, tragedy struck, casting a dark shadow over the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belgian government swiftly escalated its terror alert to the most critical level following the attack. Adding to the apprehension, a video surfaced on social media where a man claims to be the perpetrator, linking himself to the notorious terrorist organization, Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Alexander de Croo, expressing his grief over the heinous act, took to the social media platform X, once Twitter, to convey his condolences. He acknowledged the victims were Swedish but remained tight-lipped on the exact number. The so-called assailant, introducing himself as Abdesalem Al Guilani, contested official reports, suggesting there were three victims, not just two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football enthusiasts awaiting the Euro 2024 qualifying match between Belgium and Sweden were left disheartened, as officials halted the match at halftime for security precautions. UEFA’s official site teased forthcoming details on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming episode in Brussels adds to a worrying trend seen across some European nations. The Israel-Hamas conflict has put regions on high alert, with nations such as France stepping up their security apparatus after tragic incidents of their own. The French nation witnessed a harrowing incident where a teacher was fatally stabbed in an act that President Emmanuel Macron labeled as “barbaric Islamic terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although official sources remain reserved, initial reports suggest the Brussels shooter might have been targeting soccer fans. Videos circulating among local media show a man in an orange jacket, wielding a rifle, brazenly shooting in broad daylight and subsequently seeking shelter in a building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witness accounts retrieved by a Belgian newspaper claimed that the shooter cried out “Allahu Akbar” before embarking on his violent spree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-proclaimed assailant’s video message sheds further light on his motivations and affiliations. Abdesalem Al Guilani introduces himself as a soldier of Allah and a dedicated member of the Islamic State, emphasizing his commitment to their cause. The chilling proclamation involves a detailed account of his claimed actions, with the assassin seeking forgiveness from those he wronged and extending his forgiveness to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the attack, France is reinforcing its borders with Belgium, signaling a heightened state of security. Simultaneously, Belgian authorities advise locals to remain cautious and abstain from any unnecessary travel within the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

Bird’s endorsement came during a public event at the Dallas County Fairgrounds, Adel, Iowa, signaling another noteworthy addition to Trump’s growing list of high-profile endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the gathered crowd, Bird contrasted the current state of the nation under the Biden administration with the time when Trump was in office. She emphasized on issues like the open border situation, perceived disrespect towards law enforcement, and the administration’s alleged stance against farmers. “The border is wide open; our law enforcement are disrespected,” Bird asserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a deeper dive into international matters, Bird brought attention to the rising terror attacks on Israel, questioning whether such occurrences would have taken place under Trump’s watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her endorsement speech, Bird enumerated several promises she believes Trump will deliver on if elected president again. These include securing the U.S. border, confronting global terrorists, bolstering the economy, championing agricultural interests, and, most importantly, safeguarding the U.S. Constitution and the country’s cherished way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoing her deep roots in Dallas County, where she grew up and participated in 4-H projects, Bird rallied the audience to extend a hearty welcome to Trump, whom she introduced as the “next president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gratefully acknowledging the endorsement, Trump highlighted Bird’s stature in politics, not just within Iowa but also beyond. He referred to her as one of the “most-respected” figures in the realm of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it isn’t just about endorsements for Trump in Iowa. He continues to dominate the political scene, especially as the pivotal Iowa caucuses inch closer. The caucuses, which are less than 100 days away, could play a crucial role in determining the GOP nominee for the 2024 presidential race. Trump seems well-positioned, as demonstrated by a recent Iowa State University/Civiqs poll. The poll pegs Trump’s support among likely GOP caucus-goers at a dominant 55 percent, leading his nearest challenger, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, by a staggering 38 points.&lt;/p&gt;

The decision restricts Trump from making any public statements aimed at prosecutors, potential witnesses, and even the judge’s own staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move sparked an immediate and sharp rebuke from Trump’s spokesperson, who labeled the order as an “absolute abomination.” The spokesperson’s statement, relayed by Newsmax, criticizes the decision as a blatant display of partisanship. Drawing connections to current President Joe Biden, the statement suggests that this move is a targeted effort to silence “the most popular political leader in America, President Donald J. Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heated language doesn’t stop there, with the spokesperson stating that the decision is tantamount to a “partisan knife stuck in the heart of our Democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of this controversy is the issue of freedom of speech versus the integrity of the judicial process. Judge Chutkan’s order was precipitated by concerns raised by special counsel Jack Smith’s team. The team cited numerous statements from Trump that directly disparaged prosecutors, the presiding judge, and individuals who might serve as witnesses in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the prosecution’s perspective, the concern is multifaceted. On one hand, Trump’s comments, they argue, erode public trust in the court system. On the other, such comments might create an environment of harassment and intimidation, especially for potential jurors and witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to balance the scales between ensuring a fair trial and upholding freedom of speech, Judge Chutkan clarified that the gag order would not inhibit Trump from critiquing the Justice Department at large. Furthermore, he remains free to vocalize his belief that the case against him is driven by political motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political landscape in the U.S. remains deeply polarized, and developments like these often fan the flames of partisan debates. With Trump being mentioned as a potential contender for the 2024 Presidential race, every legal and political move related to him is scrutinized and can have wide-reaching implications.&lt;/p&gt;

This announcement, made to his vast audience of over 1 million X followers, emphasized his decision to support Trump’s return to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waka Flocka Flame’s endorsement comes amidst growing concerns and debates within the African American community regarding the Biden administration. Recent policies have been criticized for alienating many black voters, particularly those in underprivileged urban regions. A point of contention has been the influx of illegal immigrants into their neighborhoods, leading to the distribution of taxpayer-funded benefits often unavailable to American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of the rising concerns can be seen in Chicago. As highlighted by Breitbart News, a poll revealed that a significant portion of Chicago’s population opposes the city’s sanctuary policies, which support illegal aliens. These policies require taxpayers to fund housing, medical care, and food for illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 49% of Chicago’s white voters believe that the sanctuary city policies are worth maintaining, this sentiment is not shared uniformly across all demographics. Only 31% of black voters and 38% of Hispanic voters in Chicago agree with the stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent reports from mainstream media outlets have reflected a growing anxiety. There’s a palpable fear that African American voters might not rally behind President Biden in the 2024 elections. Many have attributed this shift to mounting disillusionment with the current administration, especially in light of pressing issues like inflation, which continues to strain household budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waka Flocka Flame’s endorsement of Trump, while just one among many, signifies a broader trend in the entertainment industry. Artists, influencers, and celebrities are becoming more vocal about their political leanings, using their platforms to sway public opinion or mirror the sentiments of their fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2024 presidential race gains momentum, such endorsements could play a pivotal role in influencing voters, particularly among younger demographics. The fusion of entertainment and politics is not new, but the weight of celebrity endorsements in swaying political outcomes remains a topic of considerable interest.&lt;/p&gt;

This bold strategy has undoubtedly caught the attention of political enthusiasts and analysts alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the freshly-minted @BidenHQ account debuted with a post exclaiming, “Well. Let’s see how this goes. Converts welcome!” As the digital space buzzed with intrigue, the account saw a rapid influx of nearly 3,000 followers. Interestingly, the only account @BidenHQ follows is Trump’s, a figure boasting a hefty 6 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the history between Biden and Trump, this move has raised eyebrows, with many questioning the motive behind such an unconventional approach. &lt;strong&gt;Rob Flaherty&lt;/strong&gt;, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, offered a candid response on platform X, saying, “A thing about campaigns is sometimes you just do things for the lolz.” In a subsequent post, Flaherty further explained they joined Truth Social “mostly because we thought it would be very funny.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the initial banter, the Biden campaign’s feed prominently showcased curated video snippets. These clips highlighted instances where Republican candidates either found fault with Trump or lauded Biden, particularly concerning Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inception of Truth Social traces back to Trump’s departure from mainstream social media channels following the notorious Jan. 6 riots. His expulsion from these platforms catalyzed the creation of this new digital space, which now paradoxically hosts an account from his political rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it remains to be seen how the Biden-Kamala campaign will leverage their presence on Truth Social, their unexpected entry into this platform sends a clear message of audacity. As the 2024 election season heats up, such strategic maneuvers will likely intensify the battle for digital dominance in the political arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that in today’s digital age, social media’s role in political campaigns is more crucial than ever. Platforms like Truth Social offer an opportunity for politicians to connect directly with their base, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers. However, the Biden campaign’s entry into Trump’s domain underscores the adaptability and willingness of political strategists to venture into uncharted territories, even if it means diving into the opponent’s digital backyard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a surprising move, the Biden-Kamala Harris 2024 campaign has established its presence on Truth Social, the social media platform founded by former President Donald Trump. This bold strategy has undoubtedly caught the attention of political enthusiasts and analysts alike. On Monday, the freshly-minted @BidenHQ account debuted with a post exclaiming, “Well. Let’s see how this goes. Converts welcome!” As the digital space buzzed with intrigue, the account saw a rapid influx of nearly 3,000 followers. Interestingly, the only account @BidenHQ follows is Trump’s, a figure boasting a hefty 6 million followers. Given the history between Biden and Trump, this move has raised eyebrows, with many questioning the motive behind such an unconventional approach. Rob Flaherty, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, offered a candid response on platform X, saying, “A thing about campaigns is sometimes you just do things for the lolz.” In a subsequent post, Flaherty further explained they joined Truth Social “mostly because we thought it would be very funny.” Amid the initial banter, the Biden campaign’s feed prominently showcased curated video snippets. These clips highlighted instances where Republican candidates either found fault with Trump or lauded Biden, particularly concerning Israel.

These developers had been seeking billions in extra taxpayer funds for their projects, citing challenges posed by inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy developers, including Empire Offshore Wind LLC, Beacon Wind LLC, and Sunrise Wind LLC, had pitched for adjusted contracts amidst rising costs. Their plea centered on amending renewable energy credit agreements inked with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, aiming to navigate the inflationary pressures that they claim are “impacting project economics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commission Chair, &lt;strong&gt;Rory Christian&lt;/strong&gt;, defended the rejection, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding a competitive bidding process. “Adjustments outside the competitive procurement process contradict long-standing Commission policy,” Christian articulated. According to the NYSPSC, endorsing these amendments would have hiked utility costs by 6.7% for residential consumers and a whopping 10.5% for business entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision has sent shockwaves through the renewable energy sector, notably as President Biden propels a vigorous green energy agenda. He has mapped out a blueprint to mobilize 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. The latest NYSPSC ruling, however, puts this ambitious target under a cloud of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred Zalcman, New York Offshore Wind Alliance Director, expressed concerns over the ruling’s implications, warning of a severe threat to projects vital for energizing New York’s green initiatives. “The decision potentially derails our efforts to localize clean energy manufacturing, rejuvenate New York’s ports, deploy skilled union labor, and revitalize environmental justice communities,” Zalcman opined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the verdict could severely strain four critical projects: Empire Wind 1, Empire Wind 2, Beacon Wind, and Sunrise Wind. These undertakings represent nearly half of New York’s offshore wind capacity goals set for 2035. They’ve been in the pipeline for years and are poised to supply electricity to millions of households between 2025 and 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Grumet, American Clean Power Association CEO, also expressed his reservations, noting, “The NYSPSC’s decision endangers New York’s environmental and clean energy trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has charted a 10-point strategy to fortify the state’s renewable energy sector. This plan envisions enhancing offshore wind development by escalating market competition and expanding the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the federal government ramps up efforts to amplify green energy infrastructure, New York’s decision highlights the intricate balance of state-level actions with national intentions. As the ripple effects of this verdict begin to emerge, it underscores the delicate interplay between local considerations and overarching national green energy ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a decision with potential nationwide ramifications, the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) has denied a renegotiation request from offshore wind energy developers.

He declared his willingness to swap places with the Israeli children held captive by Hamas in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a video conference with journalists from Italy, when questioned about the children’s condition, Pizzaballa expressed his resolve. “If my exchange can lead to the children’s freedom and bring them home, I’m ready. My total willingness is there,” Pizzaballa emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a bold statement underlines the desperation and urgency of the situation in the Holy Land. Cardinal Pizzaballa stressed the importance of prioritizing the release of the hostages to prevent further escalation. He affirmed, “We are willing to help, even me personally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Cardinal also highlighted the complexities involved. Despite his genuine intention, direct communication with Hamas, the Islamist group responsible for the attack on Israel on Oct. 7, hasn’t taken place. This attack resulted in the tragic loss of approximately 1,300 lives. “It’s extremely challenging to initiate talks with Hamas,” Pizzaballa remarked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of the attack has been devastating. Nearly 200 individuals, including about a dozen children, are currently held hostage. The attacks have severely impacted the local Christian community, with around 1,000 Christians seeking refuge in Church buildings in northern Gaza, their homes obliterated by Israeli strikes. Moving from these shelters poses a significant threat, leaving many with no choice but to stay put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pizzaballa oversees the Roman Catholic activities spanning Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, and Cyprus. His jurisdiction covers a region housing approximately 300,000 Roman Catholics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Israel strategizes a ground invasion to counteract Hamas, diplomatic channels are working relentlessly to transport aid into the besieged Gaza. The onslaught has been brutal, with Gazan authorities reporting around 2,750 fatalities, a staggering 25% being children. An additional 10,000 individuals are wounded, while another 1,000 are missing, feared buried under rubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s call for Gazans to evacuate further south has seen a significant migration, with several hundred thousand heeding the advice. Contrarily, Hamas, the governing body of Gaza, has been urging residents to dismiss Israel’s alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these dire times, acts of selflessness, like the one shown by Cardinal Pizzaballa, bring forth a glimmer of hope. As the world watches, it remains to be seen how this proposal and ongoing diplomatic efforts can alleviate the deepening crisis in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amidst the intensifying conflict between Israel and Hamas, a notable figure, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, has stepped forth with a courageous offer.

This ongoing relationship, given Proterra’s recent bankruptcy filing, has stirred political discussions and raised eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established to provide counsel on government policies and programs impacting U.S. trade, &lt;strong&gt;the White House Export Council&lt;/strong&gt; is where Joyce has been a pivotal member since February. Yet, just months later in August, under his leadership, Proterra chose to file for voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization due to negative financial trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement made earlier, Joyce highlighted Proterra’s significant contributions towards “decarbonization across the commercial vehicle industry.” He also shared the company’s struggles with market fluctuations and challenges in scaling their opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, has not deterred the White House from praising Joyce for his commitment to transitioning transit vehicles towards zero-emission solutions. But, such commendation hasn’t been without backlash. Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee Ranking Member, John Barrasso, R-Wyo., vocally criticized Joyce’s ongoing advisory role. Barrasso conveyed his concerns to President Biden, questioning why a CEO, who has overseen a company’s financial downfall, continues to provide counsel on national trade policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the intrigue, since Biden took office in January 2021, he has consistently highlighted and promoted Proterra’s achievements. Proterra’s electric bus was prominently featured in a virtual White House event hosted by President Biden himself, where executives gave the president a virtual walkthrough of the company’s South Carolina facility. Biden expressed personal anecdotes, recounting his time as a bus driver, and even promised to visit the facility in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s green energy aspirations also prominently feature Proterra. He envisions a future where all buses crafted in the USA are zero-emissions by 2030. Additionally, Biden has positioned Proterra as a paradigm of American electric vehicle success, showcasing the brand in multiple addresses about his environment-friendly energy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the ties don’t end there. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has faced her fair share of criticism for her vested interests in Proterra. Prior to her confirmation as Energy Secretary, Granholm sat on Proterra’s board and continued to hold shares in the company post-confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrasso’s final words in his letter to President Biden captured the concerns of many: the continuous promotion and favoritism towards Proterra, in light of its bankruptcy and with governmental support, beckons questions about the rationale behind such endorsements. He emphasized the need for transparency and accountability regarding public policy decisions and the businesses the presidential administration chooses to bolster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where green energy and sustainable transportation are pivotal, the Proterra story paints a complex picture of politics, business, and the challenges they face together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Despite the financial turbulence at California’s electric bus manufacturer, Proterra, its CEO, Gareth Joyce, remains a steadfast member of President Biden’s top advisory council.
