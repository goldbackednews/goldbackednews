A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Lights, Camera, Action Again - Hollywood Writers Strike Reaches Resolution!</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/28/Hollywood-Writers-Strike-Ends/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lights, Camera, Action Again - Hollywood Writers Strike Reaches Resolution!" /><published>2023-09-28T14:26:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T14:26:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/28/Hollywood-Writers-Strike-Ends</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/28/Hollywood-Writers-Strike-Ends/">&lt;p&gt;After 148 tension-filled days, Hollywood is set to spring back to life as the Writers Guild of America (WGA) resolves to lift the strike that brought the entertainment industry to a standstill. The official end to this nearly five-month-long disruption means that the wheels of Hollywood’s creation machine are finally starting to turn again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-beginning-for-hollywood-writers&quot;&gt;A New Beginning for Hollywood Writers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following intense negotiations, the union leadership authorized its 11,500 members to get back to the grind, giving the green light to tasks that had been prohibited due to the strike rules, such as pitching and selling scripts, taking meetings, and responding to notes. Writers’ rooms can also reconvene, marking the end of a period of stagnation and the beginning of new creative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-to-agreement&quot;&gt;The Road to Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strike was mainly spurred by disagreements over various aspects like minimum staffing in television writers’ rooms and compensation for the success of projects on streaming platforms. Artificial intelligence also became a point of contention during the discussions. However, a compromise was reached, allowing writers to resume work while the ratification process continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the end of the WGA strike, Hollywood may still face disruptions due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, which kicked off in July. Both unions have been manifesting strength, resilience, and solidarity on the picket lines, keeping the hopes of a fair deal alive. SAG-AFTRA has expressed its congratulations to the WGA on reaching a tentative agreement but remains firm in its commitment to achieving necessary terms for its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-implications-and-the-future&quot;&gt;The Implications and the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifting of the strike symbolizes a positive turn for Hollywood, paving the way for the creation of new, diverse, and engaging content. Writers, now free from the constraints of the strike, can once again delve into the world of imagination and storytelling, contributing to the rich tapestry of the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the journey doesn’t end here. The union members have to cast their votes between October 2 and October 9 for the contract to become official for the next three years. Until then, the world waits with bated breath, hoping for a smooth transition to normalcy and a surge in entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion---a-collective-sigh-of-relief&quot;&gt;Conclusion - A Collective Sigh of Relief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hollywood slowly starts to rev its engines again, the ending of the WGA strike brings with it a sense of optimism and anticipation. It’s a step towards revitalizing an industry that has been the source of joy, inspiration, and escape for millions around the globe. And while challenges persist, the resolve and unity displayed by the members of the industry herald a promising future, potentially filled with groundbreaking narratives and unforgettable cinematic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">After 148 tension-filled days, Hollywood is set to spring back to life as the Writers Guild of America (WGA) resolves to lift the strike that brought the entertainment industry to a standstill.

His demeanor and words displayed clear dominance, as he joyously reflected on his substantial lead in the Republican presidential primary polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech, broadcasted live and in full on Newsmax, was marked by his characteristic blend of humor and daring jabs at his GOP rivals. Speaking to a spirited crowd in Clinton Township at Drake Enterprises, a non-unionized auto parts supplier, he playfully referred to his GOP challengers as mere “job candidates,” aspiring for a role in his administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They’re all job candidates, they want to be in the — they’ll do anything. Secretary of something,”&lt;/em&gt; Trump remarked, highlighting the perceived desperation and ambition of his challengers.&lt;/p&gt;

Further investigations are underway, focusing on a possible connection between various vehicles moving from location to location during the looting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coordinated criminal activity sparked immense anger and frustration among city officials and citizens alike. Commissioner Stanford likened the incidents to the widespread protests and civil unrest that occurred in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020. “Everyone in this city should be angry,” emphasized Stanford, underscoring the impact such incidents have on the community and local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinated-criminal-activity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated Criminal Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents were a calculated effort by criminals seeking to exploit a situation, separate from a peaceful protest that took place after the dismissal of charges against a Philadelphia police officer. Videos surfacing on social media displayed masked individuals, armed with hoodies, swiftly entering stores, seizing merchandise, and fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unrest and disruption caused by the looting, the city’s resolve remains unbroken. Mayor Kenney extended his gratitude to the Philadelphia Police Department for its rapid and efficient response in dispersing crowds and making arrests related to the night’s incidents. He pledged that such criminal opportunism aimed at destroying the city would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continued-vigilance&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continued Vigilance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Police Department remains vigilant and is actively investigating these incidents to prevent any future occurrences of such disruptive and criminal behavior. “The Philadelphia Police Department is committed to maintaining public safety and order,” the department stated, reflecting the city’s determination to protect its citizens and businesses from the plague of coordinated criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking to a diverse crowd in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump criticized Biden’s approach to globalism, reaffirming his commitment to American workers, and “economic nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-economic-nationalism&quot;&gt;A Stand for Economic Nationalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump addressed his commitment to revitalizing American industries, focusing on automobile manufacturing— a lifeblood of the nation’s economy. He rebuked Biden’s overreliance on foreign batteries and rare-earth mineral mining for electric vehicles. Trump emphasized his commitment to American labor over foreign, stating: “I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empowering-american-workers&quot;&gt;Empowering American Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump communicated directly to a variety of workers including UAW members, assembly line workers, welders, mechanics, and electricians, praising them for their contributions to building the nation. His speech reflected a strong inclination towards sustaining American industry and protecting the interests of American workers. “You built this country. You love this country, and you are the ones that make our country run,” Trump appreciated, calling for a future that raises American wages, fortifies American industry, and builds national pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrasting-visions&quot;&gt;Contrasting Visions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech was clearly intended to contrast his vision of economic nationalism against what he perceives as Biden’s pandering to globalist ideals. He accused Biden of hastily planning a trip to Michigan and condemned the apparent preference of foreign profits over the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-assembly-of-blue-collar-workers&quot;&gt;An Assembly of Blue-Collar Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his address, Trump created a sense of unity and camaraderie among blue-collar workers of Michigan. He was not there merely to criticize Biden’s policies but to reassure the American worker and to salute those “who do not get the credit they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vow-to-make-america-great&quot;&gt;A Vow to Make America Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I side with the autoworkers of America and with those who want to make America great again, and I always will,” Trump vowed, underlining his perpetual allegiance to American workers. He dismissed the electric vehicle push by automakers bending to the Biden administration, calling it a threat to jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation&quot;&gt;A Battle for the Soul of the Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the UAW labor bosses allied with Biden, Trump and his campaign persisted in gathering support from various working-class groups, outlining his vision for a resurgence of economic nationalism. The speech underlined a fundamental dispute between globalism and economic nationalism, a battle for the values, dignity, and soul of the nation, resonating with those who feel overlooked and underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Trump’s energetic assembly in Michigan turned out to be more than just a political rally. It was a symphony of shared values and mutual respect, a stand for the working class against the tide of globalism, reinforcing the hope and dignity of countless Americans. His pledge to the American dream and his battle against globalism reflect a deep-rooted concern for the future of American labor and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump recently elucidated his stance on defending the American working class, contrasting his viewpoint with President Joe Biden’s policies.

&lt;p&gt;Tension was evident when President Joe Biden made a brief appearance among striking United Auto Workers (UAW) in Michigan. This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photop-session-amid-industrial-action&quot;&gt;Photop Session amid Industrial Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce. The UAW is protesting for wage enhancements amid the “Bidenflation,” concerned about the possible repercussions of Biden’s electric vehicle (EV) initiatives on their employment and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
