A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Post-Debate Power Surge - Trump Gains Ground as DeSantis Slips!</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/30/Trump-DeSantis-Poll-Swing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Post-Debate Power Surge - Trump Gains Ground as DeSantis Slips!" /><published>2023-09-30T11:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-30T11:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/30/Trump-DeSantis-Poll-Swing</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/30/Trump-DeSantis-Poll-Swing/">&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump appears to be strengthening his political influence, witnessing a remarkable 8-point swing in support among likely Republican primary voters, following the second GOP debate on Wednesday night, a debate he did not attend. This surge intensifies the anticipation surrounding potential candidates in the upcoming elections, with Trump now commanding a 51-point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-gaining-momentum&quot;&gt;Trump’s Gaining Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two days before the debate, a Morning Consult’s poll revealed 58% support for Trump. Intriguingly, his absence from the debate didn’t deter his supporters. Post-debate, his backing surged to 63%, implying that his political maneuvers and strategies continue to resonate with a substantial segment of the GOP electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desantis-faces-setback&quot;&gt;DeSantis Faces Setback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, DeSantis experienced a fall in the polls, dropping three points to 12%, a significant decline from his 15% on Monday. The sizable shift from Monday to Thursday, as highlighted by Morning Consult, is particularly noteworthy, considering there was no significant change in GOP electorate’s views after the first Republican debate in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-overall-gop-landscape&quot;&gt;The Overall GOP Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivek Ramaswamy also saw a decline, losing two points and resting at seven percent support post-debate. No other candidate in the fray managed to poll higher than five percent. The fluctuating support percentages reflect the ongoing dynamism and unpredictability within the GOP, emphasizing the need for candidates to refine their approaches and connect more effectively with the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;declining-viewership&quot;&gt;Declining Viewership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second GOP debate marked a 26% drop in viewership compared to the first, attracting less than 10 million viewers according to Nielsen ratings. Trump’s deliberate avoidance of the debates, owing to his substantial lead in the polls, has potentially contributed to this reduced interest among viewers, underscoring his pivotal role in drawing public attention to GOP events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-alternative-engagement&quot;&gt;Trump’s Alternative Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opting out of the debate, Trump chose to address striking autoworkers in Michigan instead, demonstrating his knack for tapping into populist sentiments and maintaining a direct connection with his base, irrespective of the formal political stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant shift in support towards Trump and away from DeSantis post-debate underscores the former President’s enduring impact on the Republican voter base. The continued shifts and realignments within GOP supporter preferences point to an evolving political landscape, where absence seems to make the heart grow fonder, at least in the case of Donald Trump. The unfolding scenario also raises questions about the effectiveness of debates in altering voter preferences and the broader implications for GOP dynamics moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump appears to be strengthening his political influence, witnessing a remarkable 8-point swing in support among likely Republican primary voters, following the second GOP debate on Wednesday night, a debate he did not attend.

Despite being acquitted of malicious wounding, Colie remains incarcerated, facing a lesser gun charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-prank-turns-serious&quot;&gt;A Prank Turns Serious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner Cook, a 21-year-old YouTube content creator known as “Classified Goons,” attempted to pull a prank on Colie on April 2. Cook, who earns approximately $2,000 to $3,000 a month from his videos, typically follows people around in public places and acts bizarrely. However, this prank escalated quickly when he confronted Colie at the Dulles Center Mall near Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-confrontation&quot;&gt;The Confrontation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook blasted a phrase in Colie’s face and followed him persistently, leading Colie to pull out a gun and shoot him in the chest in self-defense. Cook survived and shared the video of the shooting’s aftermath with his 55,000 YouTube followers under the title, “I Got Shot!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colie pleaded not guilty, arguing that the shooting was in self-defense, and jurors agreed to an extent, acquitting him of the most severe charges, including aggravated malicious wounding and malicious shooting inside an occupied building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legal-tangle&quot;&gt;Legal Tangle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the acquittal on serious charges, Colie was found guilty of using a firearm during the commission of a felony, leaving him behind bars. Colie’s lawyers are moving against this, claiming that the conviction is inconsistent with Virginia law, especially considering the jurors’ acknowledgment of Colie acting without malice and in self-defense. He is due back in court on Oct. 19 for a hearing on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pranks-and-consequences&quot;&gt;Pranks and Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident raises questions about the consequences of pranks and whether the quest for views and followers is pushing content creators too far, causing irreversible harm and life-changing consequences. Cook, who continues to create videos, confessed he had no idea his prank had scared or angered Colie to the extent it did, highlighting the lack of foresight and the potential dangers involved in these public pranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident serves as a stern reminder that pranks can spiral out of control and have severe repercussions, impacting lives permanently.

The procedural vote to progress the bill had earlier been successful, but the final vote hit a wall, with 198 to 232 members opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uncommon-alliances-and-strained-relations&quot;&gt;Uncommon Alliances and Strained Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one Republicans, including high-profile names like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Nancy Mace, sided with the Democrats to tank the bill. This maneuvering dealt a severe blow to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who’s been juggling disagreements within his conference throughout this spending battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-ticking-clock&quot;&gt;A Ticking Clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With federal government funding expiring at the end of the day on September 30, the inability of the House and Senate to agree on a deal threatens to bring “nonessential” federal functions to a standstill. A temporary funding extension is desperately needed to allow lawmakers more time to consolidate individual spending bills for the fiscal year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conservative-standpoint&quot;&gt;The Conservative Standpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservatives are resisting any short-term funding extension, asserting it would simply prolong the influence of the previous Democratically controlled Congress. They’ve been particularly vocal about their objections to proposals that do not align with conservative policy, leading to intensified debates on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-maneuvering-and-accusations&quot;&gt;Political Maneuvering and Accusations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy and his allies have been trying to sway the dissenters, accusing them of empowering Democrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the White House. They argue that siding with Democrats gives the opposing party more leverage to pass government funding without incorporating conservative policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discord-and-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Discord and Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ongoing discord within the Republican party and between major political parties is causing uncertainty and pushing the government ever closer to a shutdown. A government closure seems increasingly likely, with no consensus on a short-term spending patch in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;senates-countermove&quot;&gt;Senate’s Countermove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Senate is formulating its own funding extension, planning to maintain current funding levels for 45 days while also allocating additional aid for Ukraine and U.S. disaster relief. However, McCarthy remains adamant about not introducing a short-term spending bill that includes Ukraine funding to the floor unless it also encompasses border security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fallout&quot;&gt;The Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent rebellion and the subsequent clash between GOP rebels and Democrats underscore the current volatile state of American politics. If a resolution is not reached promptly, essential government functions risk being paralyzed, affecting millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadlock over the government funding bill illustrates the deep-seated divisions and ideological clashes within and between the major political parties.

Hollywood screenwriters, after a relentless 148-day strike, have clinched victory, managing to erect critical safeguards against the encroachment of AI in script writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai---a-friend-or-foe&quot;&gt;AI - A Friend or Foe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s rapid advancement in the realm of scriptwriting sparked fears, debates, and a determination among writers to protect their craft. Screenwriters rallied around the existential threat, ensuring that AI’s role in film writing remains transparent and secondary to human creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-just-about-credits&quot;&gt;Not Just About Credits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America (WGA) struck a preliminary deal mandating full disclosure from studios and production companies on AI’s involvement in any given material. The terms dictate AI can’t be credited, it can’t rewrite “literary material”, and AI-generated writing can’t be source material. The deal aims to make AI an ally rather than a usurper, with companies and writers working together harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tentative-accord&quot;&gt;A Tentative Accord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the groundbreaking agreement, both parties acknowledge the continually evolving nature of AI. The contract underscores the fast-evolving and uncertain legal landscape surrounding generative AI, leading to regular meetings between companies and the guild during the three-year contract term to adapt and refine the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-hollywood&quot;&gt;Beyond Hollywood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented strike and the resultant deal could serve as a beacon for other content creation industries. The deal forged by the WGA might become the blueprint for addressing similar concerns in visual arts, acting, and other creative sectors. In a world where AI can replicate a star’s likeness without permission or replace background actors entirely, safeguards are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-model-for-future-ai-engagements&quot;&gt;A Model for Future AI Engagements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WGA’s victory is a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of human and AI collaboration in the creative process. AI’s capacity is recognized, but it is the human spirit and creativity that are prized above all. This compromise ensures that AI serves as a complementary tool rather than a replacement, marking a significant stride in defining the relationship between humans and AI in the creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-debate-and-discussions&quot;&gt;Ongoing Debate and Discussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Writers Guild has won a significant battle, the war is far from over. This landmark agreement is just a stepping stone in the journey to understand and integrate AI in the creative world. The industry will need to regularly revisit the implications and applications of generative AI, adapting and evolving to safeguard human creativity while embracing technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-ahead&quot;&gt;The Path Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and practitioners alike will be keenly watching the developments in this domain, as this is a preliminary step in a much longer journey.

The remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia delivered relentless rainfall to the already saturated region, causing chaos and paralyzing daily life, predominantly in Brooklyn, where more than 6 inches of rain wreaked havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unprecedented-rainfall-shatters-records&quot;&gt;Unprecedented Rainfall Shatters Records&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn was particularly overwhelmed, receiving almost 7 inches of rain by midday, causing New York City Mayor Eric Adams to urge citizens to stay where they are and exercise extreme caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city witnessed rain totals ranging from 4 to 6 inches across Long Island and Hudson Valley, with some areas experiencing over 7 inches of rain. This catastrophic downpour has prompted Governor Kathy Hochul to declare a State of Emergency across the impacted regions.&lt;/p&gt;

The remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia delivered relentless rainfall to the already saturated region, causing chaos and paralyzing daily life, predominantly in Brooklyn, where more than 6 inches of rain wreaked havoc. Unprecedented Rainfall Shatters Records Brooklyn was particularly overwhelmed, receiving almost 7 inches of rain by midday, causing New York City Mayor Eric Adams to urge citizens to stay where they are and exercise extreme caution. The city witnessed rain totals ranging from 4 to 6 inches across Long Island and Hudson Valley, with some areas experiencing over 7 inches of rain. This catastrophic downpour has prompted Governor Kathy Hochul to declare a State of Emergency across the impacted regions.

Despite her pioneering political journey, her approach to legislation and her policy decisions drew the ire of both conservatives and progressives, leading to scrutiny and reflections on the implications of her liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-proponent-of-controversial-gun-control&quot;&gt;A Proponent of Controversial Gun Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s political narrative is steeped in advocacy for stringent gun control, originating from her experiences with the assassinations of Harvey Milk and George Moscone. Her co-sponsorship of the 1994 “assault weapons ban” stands out as a contentious aspect of her career, raising questions about the infringement of Second Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feminist-symbol-or-partisan-crusader&quot;&gt;Feminist Symbol or Partisan Crusader?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While her election to the U.S. Senate in 1992 marked the “Year of the Woman,” Feinstein’s subsequent tenure revealed a more partisan bent. Her introduction of unsubstantiated claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 exemplified her penchant for divisive politics, overshadowing her role as a symbol of female empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alienation-by-extreme-liberalism&quot;&gt;Alienation by Extreme Liberalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s “moderate” stance faced backlash from the more radical elements within her party. Her conciliatory approach towards Republicans and reluctance to endorse extreme progressive policies like “Medicare for All” fueled tensions, reflecting the deepening ideological chasms within the Democratic Party and the radicalizing trends within contemporary liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decline-amidst-ideological-strife&quot;&gt;Decline Amidst Ideological Strife&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s declining health and diminishing cognitive capabilities became points of concern and symbolized her diminishing influence within the party. The announcement of her retirement was met with her apparent surprise and underscored the prevailing ideological discord, positioning her as a relic of a bygone liberal era amidst rising progressive ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feinsteins-polarizing-impact&quot;&gt;Feinstein’s Polarizing Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinstein’s trajectory, marked by groundbreaking achievements and divisive liberal stances, highlights the contentious nature of her political philosophy.

&lt;p&gt;The scrutiny of Dianne Feinstein’s liberal legacy provides a lens through which the debates and conflicts shaping American politics can be examined.

Newsom Approves Protection for Abortion Pill Providers</title><link href="/news/2023/09/29/Newsom-Abortion-Bill-Signing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Groundbreaking Decision - Gov.

This significant legislation extends the already existing law in California that protects doctors providing abortion services to out-of-state patients traveling to California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extending-protection-to-providers&quot;&gt;Extending Protection to Providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California had pre-existing laws safeguarding doctors who offer abortion services from judgments stemming from other states. However, the newly signed legislation amplifies the protection, ensuring authorities do not collaborate with out-of-state investigations into providers mailing abortion pills to other states. The law also prohibits bail agents or bounty hunters from detaining doctors and pharmacists in California and transporting them to another state to face trials for providing an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-lifeline-to-essential-care&quot;&gt;A Lifeline to Essential Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health care providers, physically located in California, will be able to offer a lifeline to people in states that have cut off access to essential care, and be shielded from the draconian laws of those states,” stated the bill’s author, Democrat state Sen. Nancy Skinner. The law, akin to those in New York and Massachusetts, even restricts state-based media companies, like Facebook, from cooperating with out-of-state investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-womens-rights&quot;&gt;A Stand for Women’s Rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Newsom, reinforcing his commitment to protecting women and health care workers providing basic care, signed this landmark bill, emphasizing California’s stance on women’s rights and medical freedom. This law is crucial for those seeking essential care, especially in states with stringent pro-life laws, thus enabling a supportive network for women in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boundaries-overstepped&quot;&gt;Boundaries Overstepped?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this monumental legislation hasn’t been welcomed by all. Pro-life groups, like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the law, asserting that the California government is disregarding state borders and imposing its will. They argued that California’s protections for abortion providers overshadow the diverse values and laws of other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-legislation&quot;&gt;Impact of the Legislation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new law shields health care providers within California, those leaving the state and prescribing abortion pills will not enjoy the protection offered by the law. This legislation not only fosters medical freedom and women’s rights but also invites discussions about state sovereignty and the extent to which one state can offer protections that might infringe upon the laws of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary bill signed by Gov. Newsom symbolizes a pivotal advancement in women’s health care rights and medical freedom. It facilitates the provision of essential care to those residing in pro-life states and asserts California’s stance on protecting women’s reproductive rights. Nonetheless, the ramifications of this legislation on state relationships and the ongoing debate between pro-life and pro-choice proponents will continue to unfold in the coming times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a groundbreaking move, California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has enacted a bill that protects health care providers who mail abortion pills to pro-life states, preventing their prosecution.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trumps-unyielding-fandom&quot;&gt;Trump’s Unyielding Fandom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll, undertaken for the New York Post by Leger, reveals a substantial 62% of GOP voters preferring Trump as the party’s nominee, overshadowing Florida Gov.

Notably, Trump’s support saw a 2% rise following his absence from the first debate, highlighting the unwavering allegiance from his voter base.&lt;/p&gt;

The visit shed light on the ongoing severe situations occurring under the international bridge in Eagle Pass, where numerous migrants are being held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-spotlight-on-the-crisis&quot;&gt;A Spotlight on the Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanticipated visit by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has brought a renewed focus on the worsening border situation. It seems that Musk and Rep. Gonzales were there to observe the conditions in which migrants are being detained. This area under the international bridge has been the center of attention due to the escalating number of migrants who cross and are subsequently held, awaiting transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Gonzales had hinted at a potential visit with Musk earlier in the day. “Can’t say anything, stay tuned!” was Gonzales’ suspense-filled message to Breitbart Texas. Musk himself subtly hinted at this visit in a previous post on ‘X’. The intrigue ended when Musk, along with several Texas sheriffs and Rep.
