A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Unveiling the Silent Battle - Bob Barker’s Cause of Death</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/07/Bob-Barker-Legacy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unveiling the Silent Battle - Bob Barker’s Cause of Death" /><published>2023-09-07T13:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T13:42:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/07/Bob-Barker-Legacy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/07/Bob-Barker-Legacy/">&lt;p&gt;Bob Barker, whose name became synonymous with daytime TV and the ever-entertaining “The Price is Right,” passed away last month.

The certificate didn’t specify the exact time of diagnosis but confirmed that the beloved game show host had been living with Alzheimer’s Disease for “years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Alzheimer’s, other health challenges faced by Barker in his later years included hypertension (high blood pressure), hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). These were listed as “other significant conditions” that may have contributed to his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barker’s influence on American television is undeniable. From 1972 to 2007, his daily presence on CBS’s “The Price is Right” was a comforting ritual for countless fans, spanning generations. His signature charm and affable demeanor made him a favorite among both housewives and young ones spending a sick day away from school.&lt;/p&gt;

In the aftermath of a heinous crime that sent shockwaves through Madison, Wisconsin’s serene streets, justice seems to be on the horizon. The Madison police, in a significant breakthrough, have arrested a suspect believed to be behind the brutal assault on a University of Wisconsin-Madison student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Arrest in Disturbing Case&lt;/strong&gt;
The city breathed a collective sigh of relief as 26-year-old Brandon A. Thompson was taken into custody. Thompson, a Madison resident, now faces charges of first-degree sexual assault, first-degree reckless injury, and strangulation, as confirmed by Madison police spokeswoman Alyssa Cains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student’s life was tragically and abruptly upended in the early hours of a Sunday morning. Discovered near Lake Monona, she was left with life-threatening injuries following a savage sidewalk assault. The nature and brutality of the attack had left the community in palpable fear and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspect’s Apprehension: A Momentary Respite&lt;/strong&gt;
The arrest of Thompson, particularly given that the assault was believed to be a chance encounter with a stranger, provides a degree of closure and safety to a community grappling with the trauma of the incident. The victim, reports suggest, endured a nightmarish ordeal, having been abducted from the sidewalk and subjected to physical and sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Ahead: Ensuring Safety in Madison&lt;/strong&gt;
While Thompson’s arrest marks significant progress in this case, Madison stands at an important crossroads. This incident has highlighted the pressing need for reinforced safety measures, more patrolling, and enhanced community vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the suspect in custody, the focus shifts towards healing, community resilience, and fortifying measures to ensure that Madison’s streets remain safe for every resident and student. The unwavering commitment of Madison’s police force combined with a vigilant community will undoubtedly pave the way for a safer tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Swift Action Leads to an Important Arrest in Madison In the aftermath of a heinous crime that sent shockwaves through Madison, Wisconsin’s serene streets, justice seems to be on the horizon.

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Trump highlighted the distinctive strength and respect commanded by his administration in comparison to the Biden leadership. He discussed his deal with the Taliban, emphasizing that any violation on their part met with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former President stated, “So we [had] a step-by-step agreement. They didn’t fulfill certain steps, and therefore, we knocked the hell out of them. We didn’t lose a soldier in 18 months.” This stands in stark contrast to the violence and instability faced by American troops during the Obama administration, where Taliban snipers were a constant threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s remarks point towards the hands-on, no-nonsense approach that his administration adopted. A significant conversation with Taliban leader Abdul underlined this approach, following which the U.S. didn’t lose a single soldier for a year and a half. Trump reiterated, “They had total respect for us. And we were going to get out, but we were going to get out with dignity and strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In drawing this comparison, Trump seems to make a clear distinction between the calculated strategy adopted by his administration and the perceived hastiness and lack of preparedness under Biden.

&lt;p&gt;Harris’ claim of readiness comes as a shock to many, especially when juxtaposed against her waning popularity; a staggering 49% of registered voters hold a negative view of her, with 39% of them harboring a “very negative view.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an interview in Jakarta, Indonesia, Harris addressed President Biden’s age and health, stating she was prepared to fulfill her constitutional duty should he become unable to govern. While Harris deemed such a scenario as “hypothetical,” she emphasized that every Vice President must acknowledge the responsibility of possibly taking over the presidential role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many critics argue that Harris’ comments underscore a lack of confidence in President Biden’s fitness to serve, given his advanced age. President Biden, at 80 years old, is the oldest serving president in U.S. history. A recent AP/NORC poll revealed that a significant 77% of Americans, including 69% of Democrats, deem him too old for a second term. Such findings make Harris’ remarks all the more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris’ history as a presidential candidate, which saw her campaign fizzle out post-Democratic primary debates in 2020, is also cited by critics as a testament to her lack of widespread appeal and leadership potential. She earned fewer pledged delegates than Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or even Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the evident public reservations about her competence, Harris continues to assert her authority on multiple fronts, even holding former President Trump accountable for the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This is seen by some as an attempt to bolster her standing as a firm leader and capable presidential successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2024 election season heating up and potential competitors like Trump gaining momentum, Harris’ remarks about her readiness to take the presidential reins have not only reignited debates about Biden’s capability but have also led many to question whether Harris herself possesses the leadership qualities the country needs in these turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Vice President Kamala Harris has once again captured headlines, this time not for her diminishing approval ratings, but her comments about potentially assuming the presidency if President Biden were to be incapacitated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Store Showdown&lt;/strong&gt;
In a move that’s been called a “significant development,” Google has tentatively put its seal on a settlement concerning the ever-controversial Google Play Store. This settlement potentially addresses the grievances of consumers and various state attorneys general who have accused the digital titan of leveraging its colossal power to dominate and control the Android app market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an impending lawsuit that threatened to involve a whopping 21 million users demanding damages for what they claim were inflated app prices, this tentative agreement may have saved the day for Google. These users claim Google’s policy of taking a 30% cut from sales on its Play Store led to unjustifiably high prices – a clear mark of anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial or Truce?&lt;/strong&gt;
The recent court filing hints at a mutual desire to avoid the looming trial set for early November. Attorneys from both sides have sought the judge’s approval to put the trial on hold. However, in the twist-filled world of legal battles, if the judge decides to reject the settlement, it would mean a return to the litigation drawing board for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specifics of the settlement remain locked behind closed doors, its potential implications cannot be overstated. If the initial lawsuit claims were anything to go by, this case isn’t just about Google – it’s about the digital marketplace as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the digital ink dries on this chapter of Google’s legal adventures, and as we wait for further comments from involved parties, it raises essential questions about the balance of power in our increasingly digital world.

The actor shared a series of disturbing incidents from his childhood in New York City, a world away from the big screens where he usually graces his fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being a guest on iHeart’s “Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi” podcast, Broderick painted a vivid picture of his childhood, where he recalled being targeted often in neighborhoods near Washington Square North, the Village, Times Square, and the Upper West Side. “I got mugged often,” he stated, recounting incidents that started as young as 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confrontations weren’t always benign. Broderick spoke of one particular event when he was skateboarding through Central Park. Without warning, a large gang confronted him, and he remembered, “I got whacked in the head with some sort of stick!” Thankfully, he and his friend managed to escape, albeit with stolen possessions and a scar to remember the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this wasn’t an isolated event. The actor shared more unsettling encounters, from bullies demanding lunch money to much graver situations on New York’s subway, where strangers would threaten and interrogate him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the advice he received during those times, Broderick mentioned a school visit by a police officer who guided the kids on handling such situations. “Always bring money with you… immediately give it up and try to make the experience as fast as possible,” was the wisdom he received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew’s narrative paints a stark contrast to today’s protective environment for children. He recalls that his parents, although informed about the muggings, “weren’t as watchful as we are to our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away from these somber memories, Matthew Broderick has built a successful career and a loving family. Married to the iconic “Sex and the City” actress Sarah Jessica Parker for over two and a half decades, the couple is parents to three children - James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters, Tabitha and Marion, 13.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Notorious for his roles in films like “Wargames” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” Matthew Broderick took a moment to shed light on a less glamorous side of his past during a recent podcast.

Married to the iconic “Sex and the City” actress Sarah Jessica Parker for over two and a half decades, the couple is parents to three children - James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters, Tabitha and Marion, 13.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Neglecting Parental Rights - Chino Valley’s Controversial Notification Policy</title><link href="/news/2023/09/06/Parental-Notification-Policy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Neglecting Parental Rights - Chino Valley’s Controversial Notification Policy" /><published>2023-09-06T19:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-06T19:41:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/06/Parental-Notification-Policy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/06/Parental-Notification-Policy/">&lt;p&gt;It’s common sense: Parents have the right to know what’s happening in their children’s lives, especially when it involves significant decisions at school. But the Chino Valley Unified School District thinks otherwise, as evidenced by their new policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Rights Overlooked&lt;/strong&gt;
The Chino Valley Unified School District has come under fire with a recent policy, aiming to notify parents only if students specifically request a change in gender pronouns or identities. Thankfully, a California judge, showing a profound understanding of the importance of parental involvement, issued a temporary restraining order against this misguided attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Rob Bonta may argue that the policy “rightfully upholds the state rights of our LGBTQ+ student community,” but what about the fundamental rights of parents? Aren’t they stakeholders in their children’s well-being, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangers of Non-Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;
The notion that the district could be putting the well-being of transgender and gender-nonconforming students at risk is not in question. The real peril, however, lies in sidelining parents from these crucial discussions. Such decisions about gender identity can have deep emotional, psychological, and even medical implications. Parents should be allies in these journeys, not kept in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonta alleges dangers from “forced disclosures,” but what about the dangers of keeping secrets? Many families offer safe environments where children can freely discuss their identities. Assuming all parents are adversaries can be just as damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;
Bonta’s press releases underline the “threats” posed by policies like Chino Valley’s. But it’s critical to note that several districts, such as Anderson Union High School and Murrieta Valley Unified, are also under scrutiny for similar protocols. Why is there a push for secrecy? It raises the question: What’s the bigger agenda at play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
The ongoing battle around parental notification, with a preliminary injunction hearing set for Oct. 13, promises to be contentious. But one thing remains crystal clear: sidelining parents from the narratives of their children’s lives is a dangerous game. It’s high time school districts recognize this and prioritize open, transparent dialogues that involve all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">It’s common sense: Parents have the right to know what’s happening in their children’s lives, especially when it involves significant decisions at school.

The growing repercussions are evident, with numerous workers facing evictions, and in some unfortunate cases, resorting to living in their cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charitable entities that have been aiding the striking Hollywood community with grants reported a rising wave of housing issues impacting not just the actors and writers, but also the crew members who often work behind the scenes. The detailed account from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; reflects the far-reaching effects of the strikes, which have rendered thousands, from lighting experts to makeup artists, unemployed for extended durations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the glitz and glamour of Hollywood often overshadow the struggles of non-celebrity actors, the strikes have been a financial catastrophe for many. Actor David Baach opened up to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; about his hardships, sharing, “The strike has had a massive impact on my housing situation. I worked one day in May, and since then all the work has stopped. I’ve almost depleted my entire savings, and I’ve faced eviction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading Hollywood charities, the Entertainment Community Fund and the Motion Picture &amp;amp; Television Fund (MPTF), disclosed the grim realities workers are facing. Bob Beitcher, MPTF president, and CEO stated, “People are becoming unhoused, evicted, and even living in their cars, sometimes with their families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the MPTF is extending a helping hand by offering $1,500 grants, such sums are meager in cities as pricey as Los Angeles, leaving many still grappling with unpaid bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impasse between actors, writers, and Hollywood studios shows no sign of a resolution, with both parties unwavering on pivotal negotiating points, especially around streaming compensation. As a result, TV and movie productions across the nation have almost come to a standstill. This stalemate doesn’t only impact the film industry, but also reverberates through local economies from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">As the long-drawn Hollywood strikes remain unresolved, many actors and writers find themselves in dire circumstances.

As Special Counsel David Weiss’ team gears up to potentially indict him on federal gun charges, many are left wondering if this is a reflection of deeper issues within the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plea deal that would have seemingly swept Hunter’s legal troubles under the rug crumbled recently. The strategy to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tax evasion, potentially shielding him from a more severe felony gun charge, hit a brick wall. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika saw through what many are calling a “sweetheart deal,” rejecting it as potentially unconstitutional and deviating from standard legal practices. Such maneuverings raise concerns about preferential treatment for the President’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Merrick Garland’s decision to appoint Weiss as the special counsel overseeing the Hunter Biden saga is viewed by some as a last-ditch attempt to manage the spiraling situation. Given the ties between the Bidens and various members of the establishment, can the public expect a truly unbiased investigation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of Hunter’s legal troubles trace back to 2018 when he seemingly acted with recklessness. A firearm owned by him was discovered discarded near a school, and the connection of this incident to Hunter’s past, including his Navy discharge due to a positive cocaine test in 2014, paints a portrait of carelessness at best and criminality at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the controversy, his denial of drug use on a firearm transaction form blatantly contrasts with his known history, suggesting either a profound lack of judgement or an audacious belief in his invincibility due to his familial ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this legal drama unfolds, it’s not just Hunter Biden’s reputation that’s on the line. The integrity and credibility of President Biden’s administration face public scrutiny. The question many are asking: If the President cannot manage the actions and ethics of his own family, how can the nation trust him to lead with clarity, honesty, and integrity?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Hunter Biden, already a controversial figure due to past indiscretions, is once again under the legal microscope, casting a shadow on the Biden presidency.
