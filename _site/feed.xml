A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Tennessee Stands Firm - A Potential Breakaway from Federal Education Funding</title><link href="/news/2023/09/27/Tennessee-Education-Funding/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tennessee Stands Firm - A Potential Breakaway from Federal Education Funding" /><published>2023-09-27T15:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-27T15:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/27/Tennessee-Education-Funding</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/27/Tennessee-Education-Funding/">&lt;p&gt;In a bold move that epitomizes the spirit of state autonomy, Tennessee is contemplating a decisive step away from federal education funding. The state’s Republican leadership is spearheading discussions on potentially rejecting federal funds in favor of state funds, intending to maintain control and autonomy in how they educate their youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tennessees-independent-stance&quot;&gt;Tennessee’s Independent Stance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s consideration to sever the federal education funding strings is a significant exemplification of a state opting not to be swayed or confined by the federal government’s mandates. It is in line with Tennessee’s established conservative stance, demonstrating its commitment to prioritizing state values and principles in its governance and legislative processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We, as a state, can lead the nation once again in telling the federal government that they can keep their money, and we’ll just do things the Tennessee way,”&lt;/em&gt; remarked Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, illuminating Tennessee’s resolve to uphold its autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-the-impact&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel, called the Joint Working Group, has been constituted to study the impacts and implications of such a move. Comprising members from both the state House and Senate, this group will delve deep into the possibilities and challenges of state funding replacing federal funding for education, offering insights into whether Tennessee can independently sustain its educational endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crux-of-the-matter&quot;&gt;The Crux of the Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s leadership maintains that the education of Tennessee’s youth is paramount and should not be compromised by the strings attached to federal dollars. These federal funds invariably come laden with various mandates and restrictions, affecting the manner in which education is imparted to the children of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Federal dollars and the various mandates and restrictions that come with those dollars affect the way Tennessee’s children are educated,”&lt;/em&gt; opined Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, emphasizing the crucial nature of this potential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opposition&quot;&gt;The Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this revolutionary proposal has faced opposition, particularly from Democrats who argue that rejecting federal funds may result in “harsh consequences.” They contend that these federal funds are crucial as they support a diverse student base, including those with special needs, English language learners, and students from low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts---tennessees-educational-autonomy-and-federal-funding-independence&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts - Tennessee’s Educational Autonomy and Federal Funding Independence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s contemplation to part ways with federal education funding is a reflection of the state’s desire to carve its path and not be forced into compliance with federal conditions. It stands as a testament to the ongoing tussle between state autonomy and federal influence, with the outcome holding significant implications for the future of education funding and state-federal relations in the United States. Whether Tennessee will indeed choose the path of independence and manage education the “Tennessee way” remains to be seen, but the discussions underway are pivotal for the state’s educational landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a bold move that epitomizes the spirit of state autonomy, Tennessee is contemplating a decisive step away from federal education funding.

Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden’s re-election bid under financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blow-to-campaign-projections&quot;&gt;A Blow to Campaign Projections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden’s campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;waiting-on-bidens-blessing&quot;&gt;Waiting on Biden’s Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tentative-agreements-and-ongoing-strikes&quot;&gt;Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers’ strike as early as October. However, actors remain steadfast, continuing their strike and resulting in a dearth of celebrity fundraising events, leaving the Democrats to face the financial music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-hollywood-stars-lend-their-support-again&quot;&gt;Will Hollywood Stars Lend Their Support Again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s support was instrumental in the Biden-Harris ticket success in 2020. Celebrities threw millions at the candidates, painting the town blue. However, with Biden’s popularity plummeting amidst rising inflation and an escalating crisis at the border, Hollywood’s loyalty and financial support appear shaky at best. With the current situation labeled as toxic, the speculation is whether Hollywood stars will publicly support Biden’s campaign again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prolonged-aftermath&quot;&gt;Prolonged Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes continue to pose extensive repercussions for Democrats. As one Southern California Democratic strategist mentions, it was a “massive earthquake with prolonged aftershocks expected for months still.” Biden and the Democrats seem to be caught in a tempest with dwindling support from a crucial sector, raising the question of whether they can navigate through these turbulent times successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game of politics where financial backing can sometimes dictate the sway of power, the impact of the Hollywood strikes on Democratic coffers is evident. This situation does not only illustrate the importance of Hollywood’s support in American politics but also raises questions about Biden’s ability to manage crises and his relevance in the current political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The dual strikes by Hollywood writers and actors have reportedly had a significant impact on Democratic fundraising, including on President Joe Biden’s 2024 re-election campaign.

This incident occurs amid revelations of his team’s vigorous efforts to shield him from potential falls. The almost fall and preventative measures by his team to secure his stability raise crucial questions about his physical fitness and, by extension, his ability to lead the nation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-near-miss-on-air-force-one&quot;&gt;A Near Miss on Air Force One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to Michigan, as Biden exited Air Force One, he experienced a loss of balance around the eighth step but managed to regain it swiftly, avoiding a complete tumble. It’s crucial to consider the serious implications such incidents can have on the public’s perception of his leadership capacity, particularly in the heat of an election season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lingering-health-concerns&quot;&gt;Lingering Health Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Biden was diagnosed with significant spinal arthritis by the White House physician, following which he has encountered multiple stumbling incidents. These incidents inevitably introduce speculations regarding his age and his fitness to serve as president, sparking debates across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventative-measures-in-place&quot;&gt;Preventative Measures in Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to such issues, Biden’s campaign team is reportedly taking precautionary measures, including having him wear tennis shoes and curtailing his stair climbs to prevent any more embarrassing and potentially harmful falls. Despite these efforts, the ongoing incidents lead to increased scrutiny and pose a potentially detrimental impact on his reputation and ability to govern effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-perception--presidential-fitness&quot;&gt;Public Perception &amp;amp; Presidential Fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public opinion plays a pivotal role in determining the political trajectory of a leader. A majority of the populace, as indicated by recent polls, already believes that Biden’s age might be a significant hindrance to his ability to effectively serve for another term. A staggering 77% of the population in a recent Associated Press poll believe Biden is too old to be effective for four more years, including 69% of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calls-for-change-within-the-party&quot;&gt;Calls for Change Within the Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notable concern within the Democratic party is evident, with three out of five Democrats preferring a different nominee for the 2024 elections, according to a recent poll from the Washington Post and ABC News. This emerging inclination within the party underscores the pervasive apprehensions regarding Biden’s capability to lead the nation, rooted in his recurrent physical instabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-stability-leadership-paradigm&quot;&gt;The Stability-Leadership Paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s physical stability, or lack thereof, is becoming emblematic of his leadership stability. His competency is being critically evaluated in light of these age-related incidents, and many wonder if these instances of physical instability are reflective of his ability to lead a nation. The need for a leader who can exhibit steadfastness, both physically and in policy-making, is crucial in navigating the country through tumultuous times, and Biden’s recent incidents bring his capability to do so into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Biden’s team is making concerted efforts to prevent any further incidents that could portray the President in a less favorable light, the age-related physical instabilities continue to be a subject of national debate. It’s imperative that the leader of the free world embodies strength, stability, and assurance.

However, there’s considerable skepticism and debate surrounding these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-valuation-dispute&quot;&gt;The Valuation Dispute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Trump’s vociferous response to the valuation reflects his belief in a calculated degradation of Mar-a-Lago’s real value, part of what he views as an orchestrated attempt to tarnish his father’s name and to ostracize him from New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspective-and-comparisons&quot;&gt;Perspective and Comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To substantiate his claims, Eric Trump shared images of residential listings in Palm Beach, purportedly showing market values far surpassing $35 million.

However, there’s considerable skepticism and debate surrounding these claims. The Valuation Dispute Eric Trump’s vociferous response to the valuation reflects his belief in a calculated degradation of Mar-a-Lago’s real value, part of what he views as an orchestrated attempt to tarnish his father’s name and to ostracize him from New York. Perspective and Comparisons To substantiate his claims, Eric Trump shared images of residential listings in Palm Beach, purportedly showing market values far surpassing $35 million.

&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump is securing unexpected support from Hispanic voters as recent polls depict a surprising shift within the Hispanic Republican demographic. This newfound alliance is catching the eyes of political spectators, hinting at a potential reshaping of voting patterns in upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-univision-poll&quot;&gt;The Univision Poll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking poll by Univision revealed Trump’s expanding influence among Hispanic voters, showing 50% of Hispanic Republicans expressing their vote for Trump in the GOP primary. These findings point to a seismic change in political alignments, positioning Trump as a dominant figure within this key demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-tides&quot;&gt;The Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing multiple federal indictments, Trump’s overall support within the Hispanic community has risen to 36%, reflecting a four-point increase since he left office in January 2021. The broader Hispanic electorate, however, remains primarily liberal, with 58% choosing Biden over Trump in a hypothetical match-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economy---the-paramount-concern&quot;&gt;Economy - The Paramount Concern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hispanic voters, the economy seems to be the epicenter of concern, overshadowing other pressing issues like healthcare costs and housing prices. More than half of Hispanic voters believe that Democrats can better address these economic challenges, yet a significant number feel disenchanted with both parties’ ability to offer satisfactory solutions. This communal concern about the economy could be a pivotal factor, potentially altering established voter trends and party loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;border-security---a-bipartisan-agreement&quot;&gt;Border Security - A Bipartisan Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hispanic voters are also deeply concerned about border security, a sensitive topic that usually polarizes the electorate. Interestingly, this demographic exhibits a rare consensus, with both Hispanic Democrats and Republicans largely concurring on the necessity for elevated border security measures. With 41% of voters trusting Republicans and 40% trusting Democrats to handle the migrant crisis, it unveils a nuanced perspective within the community, providing both parties a window of opportunity to strengthen their stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insight-into-complex-sentiments&quot;&gt;Insight into Complex Sentiments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Univision poll, one of the most extensive of its kind, provides crucial insights into the intricate and diverse sentiments within the Hispanic community, shedding light on their needs and wants. It discloses a complex interplay of opinions, emphasizing the significance of understanding and addressing the concerns of this pivotal voter base. These nuanced findings showcase a multifaceted Hispanic electorate whose concerns and inclinations could play a decisive role in shaping the political landscape of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion---a-political-turning-point&quot;&gt;Conclusion - A Political Turning Point?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Trump consolidates his influence among Hispanic Republicans, he crafts a narrative of unexpected alliances and shifting loyalties. The nuanced inclinations and concerns within the Hispanic community are becoming critical variables in the political equation, poised to influence election outcomes and party strategies. This unforeseen surge in support underscores the evolving dynamics of the U.S. political spectrum, hinting at potential realignments and transformation in the future political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Unexpected Alliance Former President Donald Trump is securing unexpected support from Hispanic voters as recent polls depict a surprising shift within the Hispanic Republican demographic.

This incident, occurring at 8 p.m. Monday, was confirmed by Anthony Guglielmi, the chief of communications for the United States Secret Service (USSS). The officer, part of the uniformed division, was treated on the spot by medical personnel and is reportedly doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stressful-environment-for-pets&quot;&gt;A Stressful Environment for Pets?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for the first lady, mentioned the stress that family pets might experience due to the intense and unpredictable nature of the White House environment. The first family is reportedly working on solutions to help Commander adapt better to his surroundings. The Bidens have also expressed their gratitude to the Secret Service and the Executive Residence staff for their dedication to maintaining security and well-being within the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-history-of-aggression&quot;&gt;A History of Aggression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first instance of aggressive behavior exhibited by Commander, a purebred German Shepherd, or other dogs owned by the Bidens. Commander has been involved in at least 10 other incidents between October 2022 and January 2023, where he bit or attacked Secret Service personnel, with one case necessitating a hospital visit for the injured officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous dog owned by the Bidens, Major, also a German Shepherd, had similar aggressive encounters, leading to his relocation to live with friends in Delaware. These recurring incidents with the presidential pets underline the challenges faced by the Secret Service officers and staff in managing the security and daily operations of the executive residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secret Service continues its crucial role in providing protection for the president and his family, maintaining a substantial presence throughout the White House and its extensive grounds. The incidents with Commander have sparked discussions and reflections on the needs and suitability of pets within such high-pressure environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shakiras-tax-evasion-saga&quot;&gt;Shakira’s Tax Evasion Saga&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish authorities are holding the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer responsible for failing to pay 6.7 million euros (approximately $7.1 million) in taxes for her 2018 income, accusing her of utilizing an offshore company to achieve this. This allegation follows a previous one where she supposedly owes $15.4 million for the years between 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defending-her-fiscal-integrity&quot;&gt;Defending her Fiscal Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira maintains that during the disputed years, her official residence was in the Bahamas, meaning she is not liable to pay the said taxes to Spain. She insists through her representatives that she has “always cooperated and abided by the law” and believes her innocence will prevail in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;november-court-appearance&quot;&gt;November Court Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira, having rejected a plea deal, is scheduled for a trial in November. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of eight years and two months along with a fine of $25 million if the singer is convicted. The upcoming trial is poised to be a focal point for both fans and detractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain has been rigid, extending its tax crackdown to other high-profile personalities like soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Both had their sentences waived due to a provision favoring first-time offenders with sentences under two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shakiras-spanish-connection&quot;&gt;Shakira’s Spanish Connection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira’s ties to Spain are not just fiscal. She was romantically involved with former soccer player Gerard Piqué, with whom she has two children, and lived in Barcelona until their separation last year.&lt;/p&gt;

This revelation highlights the fluctuating dynamics and uncertainties revolving around the upcoming electoral showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-opinion---trump-leads-the-way&quot;&gt;Public Opinion - Trump Leads the Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the poll, published on Monday, 46% of registered voters would back Trump, while Biden would secure 41%, leaving 13% of voters undecided. This potential five-point lead for Trump over Biden stirs reflections on the voters’ mindset and political allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trump appears to enjoy a near-double-digit advantage among independents, with 42% in favor of Trump to Biden’s 34%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;party-solidarity---republicans-rally-behind-trump&quot;&gt;Party Solidarity - Republicans Rally Behind Trump&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the poll portrays Republicans unifying behind Trump more robustly than Democrats rallying for Biden. In this hypothetical match-up, 86% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats would favor Trump, while Biden would earn the support of 80% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This could signify deeper party solidarity and potential cross-party appeal of Trump,” political analysts comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perspectives-on-candidacies---voters-express-reservations&quot;&gt;Perspectives on Candidacies - Voters Express Reservations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll not only reveals voters’ preferences but also gauges the voters’ opinions on whether both men should contest for the presidency. Only 31% of registered voters believe Biden should run again, while a significant 69% think he should not. The numbers are slightly more favorable for Trump, with 44% supporting his run and 56% opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the parties reveals that nearly three in four Republicans believe Trump should attempt to reclaim the Oval Office, highlighting a disparity in intra-party support compared to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gop-landscape---trump-dominates&quot;&gt;The GOP Landscape - Trump Dominates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Republican party, Trump’s dominance remains evident. He garners the support of 56% of registered Republicans, with his closest competitor, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), lagging by 42 points at 14%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The GOP primary scenario underscores the significant influence and popularity Trump continues to wield within his party,” observes Charles Standard, Senior Political Correspondent.&lt;/p&gt;
