A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/14/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-14T05:13:28-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-14T05:13:28-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/14/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/14/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Drunken Intruder’s Midnight Romp in Kid’s Room Interrupted by Armed Dad</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/13/North-Dakota-Intrusion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drunken Intruder’s Midnight Romp in Kid’s Room Interrupted by Armed Dad" /><published>2023-10-13T15:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-13T15:07:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/13/North-Dakota-Intrusion</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/13/North-Dakota-Intrusion/">&lt;p&gt;In a bizarre incident that recently unfolded in North Dakota, a homeowner was confronted with the alarming sight of a naked and heavily inebriated man wreaking havoc in his daughter’s bedroom. The shocking event, taking place in the early hours, is a stark reminder of the unpredictability and potential dangers lurking even in familiar surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the silent hours of a Friday morning, the family’s peace was shattered by loud banging noises resonating from within their residence. On investigating the disturbance, the father discovered the intruder, later identified as Alvin Ducheneaux, causing a ruckus in his daughter’s unoccupied room, tossing toys and clothes around in wild abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a swift response to the unexpected intrusion, the father grabbed his firearm and held Ducheneaux at gunpoint, while instructing his wife to immediately alert the police. Bismarck Police Department promptly arrived at the West Bowen Avenue residence, finding the scene as reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turn of events raises questions on home security and the importance of remaining vigilant. The intruder, Ducheneaux, reportedly made his way into the home through an unlocked back door after the family had turned in for the night. On top of the sheer audacity of his naked intrusion, Ducheneaux compounded his criminal act by inflicting damage on the property, destroying a shoe rack and causing an estimated $200 worth of damage in the child’s room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact motivations behind Ducheneaux’s actions remain unclear, the homeowners speculate that the inebriated man might have confused their home with a neighbor’s. This possibility, however faint, highlights the complexities and dangers of intoxication, with the potential for unexpected and severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of the incident saw Ducheneaux charged with several offenses, including Burglary, Night (Class B Felony), Criminal Mischief, Willful Damage (Class B Misdemeanor), and Disorderly Conduct, Offensive Condition (Class B Misdemeanor). The seriousness of his actions has landed him in the local jail with a $5,000 cash bond. With his court appearance slated for November, Ducheneaux may confront up to a decade in prison for the felony charge alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shocking incident serves as a wakeup call for residents everywhere about the significance of home security and the unpredictable nature of such occurrences. As the family grapples with the aftermath of this startling episode, communities are reminded to remain vigilant and prioritize the safety of their homes and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a bizarre incident that recently unfolded in North Dakota, a homeowner was confronted with the alarming sight of a naked and heavily inebriated man wreaking havoc in his daughter’s bedroom.

&lt;p&gt;The findings, presented by the Strategic Posture Commission, come in the wake of escalating tensions. With China’s assertiveness over Taiwan and Russia’s controversial invasion of Ukraine, the international scene is heating up. Although no clear evidence indicates active nuclear cooperation between China and Russia, there are concerns of potential strategic coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s implications are immense. It essentially challenges the current US national security strategy, which revolves around deterring one conflict while winning another. Implementing the recommended changes would mean a considerable uptick in defense expenditure, the feasibility of which remains to be seen given the constraints of the congressional budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the financial implications, the report’s preface, penned by Democratic chair Madelyn Creedon, and vice-chair Jon Kyl, underscores the nation’s need for these investments. During the report’s release, Kyl further emphasized the importance of rallying public support for increased defense spending, arguing that it’s a minimal price for potentially averting a full-blown nuclear war involving the major players: the US, China, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings starkly contrast with President Joe Biden’s stance, which leans towards the sufficiency of the current US nuclear arsenal in deterring combined threats from Russia and China. Responses from advocacy groups like the Arms Control Association echo this sentiment, suggesting that the existing arsenal already surpasses deterrent needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Strategic Posture Commission remains firm: to uphold the values of the U.S.-led international order, the nation and its allies must be adequately equipped to deter and overcome both adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created in 2022, this panel of equal Democratic and Republican representation set out to evaluate long-term threats and suggest modifications in the US’s defense approach. Their evaluation warns of the acute threats from China and Russia, especially between 2027-2035. As China expands its nuclear arsenal – projected to reach 1,500 warheads by 2035 – the US faces the challenge of contending with two primary nuclear adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 145-page report is comprehensive, advocating for the complete funding of the 30-year US nuclear arms modernization program initiated in 2010. Among the many recommendations, it pushes for the deployment of increased tactical nuclear weapons across Asia and Europe, more B-21 stealth bombers, new Columbia-class nuclear submarines, and consideration for deploying reserve US nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate takeaway? The US needs to amplify the “size, type, and posture” of its conventional forces in collaboration with allies. Without these enhancements, the nation might find itself leaning heavily on its nuclear arsenal – a situation the world would be better off avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amid the rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, a bipartisan panel appointed by Congress has sounded the alarm: the United States must bolster its defense mechanisms in readiness for potential simultaneous conflicts with Russia and China.

&lt;p&gt;John Kirby, White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, recently shared insights on MSNBC’s “The Beat” concerning the President’s plan of action. Kirby emphasized Biden’s dedication to continuously discuss the Middle East conflict and assure unwavering support for Israel. This commitment is further cemented by Biden’s endeavors to release hostages held by Hamas and to express solidarity with the affected families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the domestic front, the President’s plate is no less full. Economic challenges, particularly the so-called “junk fees,” are at the forefront of his concerns. Kirby highlights that addressing these issues is crucial in governing and demonstrates the President’s capacity to multitask – dealing with pressing global concerns while not sidelining urgent domestic matters. As Kirby succinctly put it, “That’s what being President is, that’s what being commander-in-chief is. You’ve got to handle it all, and he’s more than equipped and more than ready to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the global importance of the ongoing Middle East conflict, Ari Melber, the host of the show, questioned whether President Biden would consider addressing the nation or Congress formally. Kirby’s response, though non-specific, hinted at future communications from the President on the subject. However, he also mentioned that President Biden would touch upon other international topics, including situations in Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual focus of President Biden – emphasizing unwavering support for allies in distress and tackling domestic issues head-on – paints a picture of a leader capable of multitasking on the global stage. As the days ahead promise more challenges, both internationally and domestically, America waits to hear more from the Commander-in-Chief, hoping for resolutions and pathways to a more secure future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where news cycles shift rapidly, and global events can often overshadow domestic concerns, Biden’s commitment to juggle both with equal fervor marks a significant leadership stance.

Key indexes took a hit, with investors closely watching as U.S. Treasury bond yields climbed, and consumer prices surged higher than initial projections for September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in consumer prices can be attributed to mounting shelter costs. However, if we set aside the inconsistent food and energy sectors, the yearly growth in the core figure is the lowest it’s been in two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early trading saw the S&amp;amp;P 500 wavering between profits and losses. But by 1 p.m. EDT, after a U.S. Treasury auction for 30-year bonds witnessed lukewarm demand, the index took a definitive downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael James, the Managing Director of Equity Trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, highlighted, “The past two months have seen the market grappling with escalating interest rates. Any substantial fluctuation can lead to noticeable ripples in equities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-auction, the S&amp;amp;P 500 recorded a dip of 27.50 points (0.63%), settling at 4,349.45 points. The Nasdaq Composite wasn’t spared either, dropping by 85.46 points (0.63%) to reach 13,574.22. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid by 173.77 points (0.51%) and stood at 33,631.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. benchmark 10-year yields observed a spike after unveiling the inflation data, reaching a high of 4.728% following a two-day decline. This upsurge primarily weighed down on rate-sensitive sectors like utilities and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the iShares Home Construction ETF experienced a drop, and the homebuilding stocks felt the pressure, especially with the afternoon surge in bond yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all sectors felt the heat equally. Energy and information technology sectors of the S&amp;amp;P 500 appeared to be relatively more resilient during the trading hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the present climate, traders predict a probable interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve before year-end, followed by sustained higher rates into the next year. Boston Fed President, Susan Collins, hinted at more potential interest rate hikes, emphasizing their goal to align inflation back to its target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wall Street braces itself, investors are keenly waiting for the earnings season, set to kick off this Friday. Financial giants like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are scheduled to reveal their quarterly results before the trading bell.&lt;/p&gt;

Key indexes took a hit, with investors closely watching as U.S. Treasury bond yields climbed, and consumer prices surged higher than initial projections for September. The rise in consumer prices can be attributed to mounting shelter costs. However, if we set aside the inconsistent food and energy sectors, the yearly growth in the core figure is the lowest it’s been in two years. Early trading saw the S&amp;amp;P 500 wavering between profits and losses. But by 1 p.m. EDT, after a U.S. Treasury auction for 30-year bonds witnessed lukewarm demand, the index took a definitive downturn. Michael James, the Managing Director of Equity Trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, highlighted, “The past two months have seen the market grappling with escalating interest rates. Any substantial fluctuation can lead to noticeable ripples in equities.” Post-auction, the S&amp;amp;P 500 recorded a dip of 27.50 points (0.63%), settling at 4,349.45 points. The Nasdaq Composite wasn’t spared either, dropping by 85.46 points (0.63%) to reach 13,574.22. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid by 173.77 points (0.51%) and stood at 33,631.10.

The loss deeply resonates with fans and music enthusiasts who’ve been influenced by the timeless hits of the band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Isley Brothers, celebrated for their chart-topping songs such as “Shout!”, “Twist and Shout,” and “This Old Heart of Mine,” have left an indelible mark on the world of music. Rudolph’s contribution as a key member has made him an integral part of the band’s success and journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronald Isley, Rudolph’s brother, expressed his deep sorrow in a statement to Fox News Digital, “There are no words to express my feelings and the love I have for my brother. Our family will miss him. But I know he’s in a better place.” The specific details surrounding Rudolph’s death remain undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Isley Brothers’ story began in the 1950s, when Rudolph, along with his brothers Ronald, Vernon, and O’Kelly Isley, formed the group. The band faced a tragic setback when Vernon, at just 13, died in a bicycle accident. Despite this early loss, the Isleys’ passion for music didn’t waver. Rudolph, O’Kelly, and Ronald persisted and eventually wrote “Shout!”, a song that not only skyrocketed their fame but also found a cherished place in pop culture, notably in the film “National Lampoon’s Animal House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years rolled on, the younger Isley siblings, Ernie and Marvin, teamed up with Chris Jasper, their brother-in-law, expanding The Isley Brothers’ lineup. Their collective efforts and iconic songs cemented the band’s reputation in the music world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Isley Brothers’ talents and contributions haven’t gone unrecognized. In 1992, the group received one of the highest accolades in the music industry, with their induction into the Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame. This was followed by another monumental honor in 2014 when they were presented with the Grammy lifetime achievement award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the passing of Rudolph Isley, the music world has lost a shining star. But as fans from all over the globe pay tribute, it’s clear that his legacy and the magic of The Isley Brothers’ music will continue to inspire and entertain generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In a heartbreaking announcement, Rudolph Isley, the founding member of the iconic R&amp;amp;B group The Isley Brothers, has passed away at the age of 84.

This acknowledgment has led to an intense debate around privacy, data security, and the implications for high-profile figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the Justice Department formally charged Charles Edward Littlejohn, a 38-year-old from Washington, D.C., for stealing and leaking tax return information of thousands, including the former President. The leaks spanned between 2018 and 2020 and were handed over to two major news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes expressed her profound concern over the leaks, underscoring the importance of the rule of law. In a statement, she remarked, “When we have people, for whatever reason, take the law into their own hands society doesn’t function.” She further emphasized that no justification could make such acts acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn’s plea pertains to the unauthorized disclosure of tax returns, a charge that can lead to a prison term of up to five years. The final decision on the sentence, however, rests with the judge and will be announced on January 29. Details on whether Littlejohn cooperated with the prosecutors or if the plea was a result of a deal remain under wraps, as his attorney, Lisa Manning, chose not to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the charges did not specify the news outlets involved, the time frame and nature of the leaks point towards The New York Times and ProPublica. The former had published a revealing report in 2020 about Trump’s federal income tax, indicating he paid merely $750 the year he assumed office. ProPublica’s 2021 expose, on the other hand, showcased the minimal tax contributions of America’s wealthiest, igniting a passionate debate on tax reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unauthorized leaks have not only sparked political and social debates but also raised valid concerns regarding data security and the sanctity of taxpayer information. As a direct response to the revelations, the IRS reaffirmed its commitment to taxpayer data confidentiality, revealing new measures to bolster its security mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the nation awaits Littlejohn’s sentencing and further details on the leak, questions about data privacy, the role of journalism, and the ethics of revealing such information continue to dominate discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a significant development related to the unauthorized leaks of tax return details of many, including former President Donald Trump, a former contractor of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has pleaded guilty.

During an interview on The Charlie Kirk Show, Marlow emphasized that it’s a grave error to not “take this guy seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlow’s research paints Biden as an intricate political player with a vast network established over 50 years. While many have questioned how Biden, often criticized for his gaffes and lacking a captivating ideological stance, reached the White House, Marlow believes he understands the formula. According to him, Biden was instrumental in crafting the Democrat Party’s machinery that eventually selected him. “He wasn’t just propped up — the guy was forging a lot of the gears that made the machinery of the Democrat Party,” Marlow explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fascinating aspect that Marlow touched upon was Biden’s initial intention to hand over his political legacy to his son, Beau. But with Beau’s untimely passing and no clear successor to former President Barack Obama, Biden, with his immense knowledge of the party’s inner workings, emerged as the most viable candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the Democrat’s strategy, Marlow remarked, “They are looking for operators, and Joe was the ultimate operator.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief that Biden’s regular slip-ups are a recent development, Marlow stated, “He’s always done this nutty stuff.” He stressed that Biden’s behavior is consistent over the years. While he acknowledges some extent of mental deterioration, he believes much of the criticism is misplaced. Biden has “always been this way,” Marlow reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Marlow’s most significant point of the interview was his cautionary statement regarding Biden’s potential to clinch another term. Despite the president’s seemingly bumbling demeanor, his track record shows a series of wins. If the opposition continues to underestimate him, they might be setting themselves up for a surprise. “We can’t shake this guy, and that’s why the hard reset needs to take place,” Marlow advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, Marlow urged a change in the way opponents perceive Biden. Recognizing his strengths, understanding his strategies, and crafting a robust counter-narrative would be crucial for those aiming to challenge him in the next election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlow’s book, &lt;em&gt;Breaking Biden: Exposing the Hidden Forces and Secret Money Machine Behind Joe Biden, His Family, and His Administration&lt;/em&gt;, dives deeper into these insights and is available in multiple formats for those eager to delve deeper into the Biden phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a recent conversation centered on his New York Times bestseller, Breaking Biden, Breitbart’s Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow made a compelling case about President Joe Biden’s resilience and potential for reelection.
