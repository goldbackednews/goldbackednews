A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/29/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-29T17:12:20-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-29T17:12:20-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/29/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/29/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Pumpkin Farmers Under Pressure: Water Scarcity, Soaring Heat, and Rising Labor Costs</title><link href="/news/2023/10/29/Pumpkin-Farming-Woes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pumpkin Farmers Under Pressure: Water Scarcity, Soaring Heat, and Rising Labor Costs" /><published>2023-10-29T16:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-29T16:57:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/29/Pumpkin-Farming-Woes</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/29/Pumpkin-Farming-Woes/">&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin farmers in the Western regions of the United States are navigating through a storm of challenges, including unrelenting heat, scarce water supplies, and escalating labor costs. Alan Mazzotti, a farmer in northeast Colorado, has firsthand experience with these issues, witnessing the snow-capped Rocky Mountains on clear days, yet struggling with insufficient water supplies for his pumpkin crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environmental challenges are compounded by financial strains. Rising labor costs and inflation are cutting into profits, squeezing the viability of pumpkin farming. Mazzotti had to make the tough decision to plant only half of his usual pumpkin crop due to water delivery being cut by half. The unexpected heavy rains that followed were too late to save the season, illustrating the unpredictable nature of farming in today’s climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers across Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado are experiencing similar predicaments. Climate change is intensifying drought conditions and heat extremes, resulting in reduced yields and barren lands. Some farmers have reported losses of 20% or more in predicted yields, showcasing the severe impact of these environmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial aspect of pumpkin farming is becoming increasingly precarious. Soaring labor costs, propelled by new laws ensuring overtime pay for farmworkers, are narrowing profit margins. Lindsey Pyle, a North Texas farmer, highlights the surge in expenses, from seeds and fuel to supplies and chemicals, resulting in a 20% yield loss. The cost of irrigation is skyrocketing as groundwater levels drop, driving energy bills into the thousands of dollars each month for some farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertain future of pumpkin farming is a growing concern. Groundwater scarcity is a critical issue, with aquifers being depleted at an alarming rate. Climate change is reducing the precipitation needed to recharge these water sources, threatening the long-term sustainability of pumpkin farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers are forced to make tough choices about which crops to plant and how to allocate their dwindling water resources. The rising cost and availability of labor are additional challenges, creating a financial burden that may be unsustainable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the myriad of challenges faced by pumpkin farmers in the Western US paints a stark picture of the agricultural industry’s future. The intersection of environmental, financial, and labor-related issues requires urgent attention and innovative solutions to ensure the sustainability of pumpkin farming and the broader agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Pumpkin farmers in the Western regions of the United States are navigating through a storm of challenges, including unrelenting heat, scarce water supplies, and escalating labor costs.

Steve Daines (R-MT) has made a powerful call for unity within the Republican party, urging his fellow GOP members to rally behind former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move, seen by many as a decisive attempt to consolidate the party’s power, comes at a crucial time when the political landscape is fraught with division and uncertainty. Sen. Daines, a significant figure in the Republican party and a fervent supporter of Trump, believes that this is the strategic move that the GOP needs to ensure victory in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His call for unity follows the recent withdrawal of former Vice President Mike Pence from the presidential race, a move that Daines praised and saw as a step in the right direction. “I was surprised, but I think that’s the right move,” Daines commented, emphasizing the need for the party to coalesce around Trump as the clear front-runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plea for consolidation is not just a simple endorsement of Trump; it represents a major push by a top-tier GOP leader to shape the direction of the party’s future. As NRSC chairman, Daines plays a pivotal role in determining party spending and resource allocation for U.S. Senate races, and his influence is crucial in rallying support for key Senate candidates across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for unity goes beyond mere political posturing; it is a calculated effort to streamline the party’s resources and focus, aiming to solidify support behind Trump and avoid a prolonged and potentially divisive primary battle. Daines’s statement reflects a growing sentiment within the party that Trump’s nomination is inevitable, and that the sooner the party unites behind him, the stronger their position will be in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polls have consistently shown Trump as the clear favorite among Republican voters, with a commanding lead over other potential GOP candidates. His popularity and influence within the party remain strong, and his ability to mobilize the Republican base is unparalleled. This makes him a formidable opponent for any Democratic candidate, including incumbent President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By urging his fellow Republicans to unite behind Trump, Sen. Daines is sending a clear message that the time for internal party squabbles is over. The GOP needs to focus on the bigger picture, and that means consolidating their support behind the candidate who has the best chance of leading them to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2024 Presidential election draws nearer, the Republican party finds itself at a crossroads. Sen. Daines’s call for unity is a bold move that has the potential to shape the future of the GOP and solidify their position as a united front ready to take on the challenges of the election season. Only time will tell if his fellow Republicans will heed his call and rally behind Trump, but one thing is certain: the stakes have never been higher, and the need for unity has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Sen.

At least two people were killed, and 18 others were left injured in a chaotic scene filled with revelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred just before 3 a.m. near a popular strip of bars and clubs located on the 1600 block of East 7th Avenue. According to Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw, a fight broke out between two groups amidst hundreds of innocent bystanders who were caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violence quickly escalated, leading to an exchange of gunfire that left the crowded street in disarray. Video footage captured at the scene reveals the moment of panic as shots rang out, causing partygoers in elaborate Halloween costumes to flee for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath showed a scene of devastation, with injured victims on the ground receiving urgent medical attention from police officers. In the wake of the tragedy, the police taped off an extensive area spanning four to five blocks in downtown Ybor, conducting a thorough investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmitt Wilson, a devastated parent who lost his 14-year-old son Elijah in the shooting, described the young victim as a “good child” who was simply “at the wrong place at the wrong time.” The sorrowful father also mentioned his efforts in advising his son to avoid certain company, a plea that tragically went unheeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tampa Police Department reported that one male suspect had turned himself in, and investigations are underway to identify and locate a second shooter believed to be involved in the incident.

Trump vowed a robust American stance against Hamas and any threats to Israel, promising a return to strength and decisiveness if he reclaims the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech, live-streamed to a nationwide audience, laid out a clear vision for American-Israeli relations, contrasting his administration’s unwavering support for Israel with what he perceives as Biden’s faltering resolve. “When I am back in the White House, the United States will stand with Israel all the way — without hesitation, without qualification, and without apology,” Trump declared, setting a tone of determination and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This address comes at a critical time, as antisemitic attacks surge globally, and the situation in the Middle East remains volatile. Trump emphasized the need for unequivocal strength, stating, “Evil only respects one thing: unyielding strength. You’ve got to be strong. Otherwise, they’re going to be taking over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEO keywords such as “Trump,” “Israel,” “Hamas,” “American strength,” and “presidential commitment” were prominent throughout the speech, reflecting a strategic approach to online visibility and engagement. By aligning his potential future presidency with unwavering support for Israel and a strong retaliatory stance against terrorist attacks, Trump taps into key voter concerns and solidifies his position as a candidate of strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump did not hold back in his critique of Biden, blaming the current administration for the recent attack on Israel and the escalation of global tensions. “Joe Biden’s weakness caused the attack on Israel. Pure weakness and incompetence. Everywhere he goes, Biden’s weakness provokes war and death,” Trump asserted, positioning himself as the antidote to perceived current weaknesses in American foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former president’s promises extended beyond verbal support, directly addressing the threat posed by Hamas. “When I am back in the White House, America’s enemies will know once again — and they’re going to know it — that if you try to kill our citizens, we kill you. If you spill a drop of American blood, we spill a gallon of yours,” he stated, establishing a clear and unambiguous policy of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech serves as a powerful call to action, rallying support for a strong America and a secure Israel. As the country navigates these uncertain times, Trump’s words resonate with those seeking a return to strength and decisiveness on the world stage, positioning him as a key player in the ongoing political narrative.

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Perry’s portrayal of the sarcastic, quick-witted Chandler Bing made him a household name and solidified his place in the pantheon of television’s greatest actors. For ten seasons, Perry’s impeccable timing and unique delivery brought to life a character that resonated with audiences worldwide, turning ‘Friends’ into a cultural phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ‘Friends’ showcased Perry’s comedic prowess, it also masked the personal struggles he faced off-screen. Perry’s battle with addiction was a well-kept secret, a dark contrast to the laughter and joy he brought to living rooms across the globe.

This temporary freeze is a strategic measure, ensuring that U.S. arms do not inadvertently contribute to regional instability, human rights violations, or criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporary suspension will impact most civilian export licenses, allowing authorities adequate time to assess potential risks and implications associated with firearm exports. This decisive action reflects the government’s dedication to safeguarding national security and promoting global stability. However, it’s crucial to note that the ban does not extend to around 40 countries, including Israel and Ukraine, which have separate export agreements for firearms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. firearms companies like Sturm Ruger &amp;amp; Co., Vista Outdoor, and Smith &amp;amp; Wesson Brands could feel the impact of this temporary halt, as it could potentially disrupt their international sales and operations. As a significant player in the global arms market, the U.S.’s temporary halt is a clear signal of the government’s willingness to prioritize security over profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global government clients seeking to acquire firearms during this period must provide comprehensive details about the end recipients of the firearms. The Commerce Department is standing firm, stating that any government applications lacking explicit end-user details will be returned “without action.” Civilian license applications will also be “held without action,” ensuring a meticulous and accountable process during this critical period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This temporary halt is a call to arms for responsible trade and accountability in the arms industry. It sends a strong message about the U.S. government’s commitment to preventing the misuse of firearms and ensuring they do not contribute to global instability or human rights abuses. This move is expected to establish a precedent for responsible and secure trade practices in the international arms market, fostering a safer and more stable global environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s bold decision to temporarily halt most civilian firearm exports highlights the country’s unwavering commitment to national security and global stability. This strategic pause ensures the U.S. arms exports do not contribute to violence or instability, setting a new standard for responsible governance and secure trade practices in the international arms trade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a surprise move the U.S. Department of Commerce has announced a 90-day halt on the majority of civilian firearm exports.

Buddy Carter, R-Ga., underscored the paramount importance of enforcing stringent border security measures and maintaining a relentless stance against terrorism within the halls of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter was unequivocal in his message: “Look, if you have ties to terrorist organizations or if you support terrorist organizations, there’s no place for you in the United States Congress, and you don’t need to be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timely conversation comes in the wake of a resounding vote by the House to express steadfast support for Israel and to denounce Hamas in the strongest terms. With a vote tally of 412 in favor, 10 opposed, and 6 abstaining, the resolution was overwhelmingly supported by lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution firmly positions the House alongside Israel in its defense against “the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists,” affirming Israel’s right to defend itself. Moreover, it delivers a sharp rebuke to Hamas, calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the release of hostages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter did not mince words in expressing his disappointment with the 10 members who chose not to back the resolution. He emphasized the near-unanimity of support, stating, “I’m very, very disappointed that these people who did not support this; this is obvious. It was overwhelming with only just a few of them who didn’t. … If you support terrorism, if you have ties to terrorism, there’s no place for you in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue of border security, Carter drew a direct connection to national security, expressing alarm at the ease with which individuals are currently able to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. He highlighted the potential for terrorists to exploit this vulnerability, stating, “Oh, no question about it. Listen, that is a porous border. I mean, people are crossing that; and we would be naive to think that they’re not terrorists who are coming across that border with the intention of hurting us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He reinforced the idea that the primary responsibility of the federal government is to protect American soil, a task he believes can only be accomplished through robust and secure borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter did not hold back in his critique of the current administration’s approach to border security, asserting, “This administration is just ridiculous in what they’re doing right now. They are not doing anything at all to protect us, and we’re just welcoming in people who truly do want to hurt us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded with a call to action, underscoring the urgency of strengthening our borders to ensure the safety and security of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a bold statement Rep.

&lt;p&gt;Authored by Brent Bennett and Jason Isaac, the report titled “Overcharged Expectations: Unmasking the True Costs of Electric Vehicles,” delves deep into the direct and indirect costs associated with EV ownership. While many EV advocates loudly proclaim the affordability of electric vehicles, citing costs equivalent to $1.21 per gallon of gasoline, this study brings to light a startlingly different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors argue that when you factor in the cost of charging equipment and losses over a period of 10 years and 120,000 miles, an additional $1.38 per gallon equivalent needs to be added. Furthermore, when the costs of subsidies are included, the actual cost of fueling an electric vehicle skyrockets to a staggering $17.33 per gallon of gasoline equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study scrutinizes the role of U.S. government regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions standards, in indirectly financing the growth of the EV market. Automakers are left with no choice but to conform to these standards, often resulting in a push towards manufacturing more EVs, or purchasing credits from compliant companies. This scenario introduces hidden costs to traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles, which the study argues are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors pose a crucial question: “When an EV owner connects to the electric grid, how much are they paying for the extra generation, transmission, and distribution costs that they are imposing on the grid, and will those embedded costs rise over time?” They conclude that the EV industry, buoyed by federal government support and regulations pushing for more EV production, is masking the true costs of EV ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the study provides a conservative estimate that the average EV accrues $48,698 in subsidies and an additional $4,569 in charging and electricity costs over a decade. This results in a total cost of $53,267, equating to $16.12 per gallon of gasoline equivalent. The stark reality, according to the authors, is that without continued and substantial government support, electric vehicles will remain more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eye-opening report urges consumers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to reevaluate the true costs of electric vehicle ownership, ensuring that decisions are made based on comprehensive and transparent information.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a ground-breaking study recently released by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, researchers have exposed what they believe to be the true costs of fueling electric vehicles (EVs), significantly challenging the popular narratives surrounding the cost-effectiveness of EVs.
