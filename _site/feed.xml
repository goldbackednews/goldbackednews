A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Triumph and Taunts - Trump Labels GOP Rivals as Mere ‘Job Candidates’</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/28/Trump-GOP-Debate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Triumph and Taunts - Trump Labels GOP Rivals as Mere ‘Job Candidates’" /><published>2023-09-28T12:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T12:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/28/Trump-GOP-Debate</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/28/Trump-GOP-Debate/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-triumphant-return&quot;&gt;Trump’s Triumphant Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump, unabashed and more confident than ever, made a powerful appearance before autoworkers and the working-class citizens of Michigan on Wednesday night. His demeanor and words displayed clear dominance, as he joyously reflected on his substantial lead in the Republican presidential primary polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playful-jabs-at-gop-hopefuls&quot;&gt;Playful Jabs at GOP Hopefuls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech, broadcasted live and in full on Newsmax, was marked by his characteristic blend of humor and daring jabs at his GOP rivals. Speaking to a spirited crowd in Clinton Township at Drake Enterprises, a non-unionized auto parts supplier, he playfully referred to his GOP challengers as mere “job candidates,” aspiring for a role in his administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They’re all job candidates, they want to be in the — they’ll do anything. Secretary of something,”&lt;/em&gt; Trump remarked, highlighting the perceived desperation and ambition of his challengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vp-possibilities--a-resounding-no&quot;&gt;VP Possibilities – A Resounding ‘No’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump was subtle yet impactful in his dismissal of his rivals as potential running mates. He reiterated his commitment to not consider anyone running against him as his next vice president, making it clear that he sees no worthy candidate for the VP role among the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They even say VP, does anybody see any VP in the group?” Trump queried the crowd, adding, “I don’t think so,”&lt;/em&gt; thereby expressing his discerning stance on the caliber of his competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-statement-of-confidence&quot;&gt;A Statement of Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s remarks and his casual, yet disparaging references to his rivals are indicative of his confidence in his political journey. His approach, exuding assurance and supremacy, sends a potent message about his stance in the political arena, depicting him as a leader who is secure in his position and unthreatened by his competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections-on-political-dynamics&quot;&gt;Reflections on Political Dynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gathering in Michigan was not just about political commentary but also a reflection of the underlying dynamics and competition within the GOP.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai---curtailing-biased-narratives&quot;&gt;AI - Curtailing Biased Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is pioneering a revolutionary shift in television consumption, opening up avenues for diverse and balanced content, thereby mitigating the omnipresence of left-leaning bias prevalent in mainstream cable channels like CNN, Comedy Central, and MTV. This shift not only marks the decline of one-sided narratives but also brings forth a more equitable and balanced media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personalized-and-viewer-centric-experiences&quot;&gt;Personalized and Viewer-Centric Experiences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced streaming services such as Netflix, Apple, and Amazon, are employing AI to analyze intricate patterns of viewer habits, preferences, and interactions. This allows them to curate and recommend content that aligns with individual tastes, ensuring an engaging and tailored viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;streaming---a-merit-based-platform&quot;&gt;Streaming - A Merit-Based Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming services, propelled by the precision and intelligence of AI, operate on merit-based frameworks, unlike cable TV which often elevates content not on merit, but on other discretionary and biased parameters. Streaming platforms must earn their keep through direct subscription fees, bringing forth content that genuinely resonates with viewers, free from the artificial sustenance provided by cable networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the AI-driven streaming domain, the success of content is exclusively determined by its intrinsic quality and viewer appeal. This is in stark contrast to cable TV, where the rigidity and constraints of the medium often lead to the proliferation of subpar content, benefiting from a system that isn’t fully reflective of genuine viewer preference or merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dismantling-traditional-media-monoliths&quot;&gt;Dismantling Traditional Media Monoliths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative intervention of AI is signaling the gradual obsolescence of conventional media outlets that have long thrived on one-dimensional and skewed representations. Channels sustained by cable TV, despite their limited viewership and appeal, are facing an inevitable decline, pressured by the ascendancy of meritocratic streaming services and the equitable media environment enabled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the emerging landscape, AI is empowering viewers to break free from the monopolistic grip of mainstream cable narratives and to explore a diverse array of content that is more harmonious with their preferences and values.

This mass looting phenomenon targeted major retail outlets, including an Apple store, Foot Locker, and Lululemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sickening-display-of-opportunism&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sickening Display of Opportunism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia’s Mayor, Jim Kenney, and Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford, have vehemently condemned the acts of coordinated looting that ravaged the city. “This was a sickening display of opportunistic criminal activity, and we will not stand for it,” declared Mayor Kenney, asserting the city’s stance against such destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swift-retaliation-by-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift Retaliation by Law Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rapid response, the Philadelphia Police Department apprehended between 15 to 20 individuals involved in the flash-mob style ransacking of stores, displaying their commitment to maintaining public safety and order. Further investigations are underway, focusing on a possible connection between various vehicles moving from location to location during the looting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-city-in-anguish&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A City in Anguish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coordinated criminal activity sparked immense anger and frustration among city officials and citizens alike. Commissioner Stanford likened the incidents to the widespread protests and civil unrest that occurred in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020. “Everyone in this city should be angry,” emphasized Stanford, underscoring the impact such incidents have on the community and local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinated-criminal-activity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated Criminal Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents were a calculated effort by criminals seeking to exploit a situation, separate from a peaceful protest that took place after the dismissal of charges against a Philadelphia police officer. Videos surfacing on social media displayed masked individuals, armed with hoodies, swiftly entering stores, seizing merchandise, and fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citys-resolve-to-restore-order&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City’s Resolve to Restore Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the unrest and disruption caused by the looting, the city’s resolve remains unbroken. Mayor Kenney extended his gratitude to the Philadelphia Police Department for its rapid and efficient response in dispersing crowds and making arrests related to the night’s incidents. He pledged that such criminal opportunism aimed at destroying the city would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking to a diverse crowd in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump criticized Biden’s approach to globalism, reaffirming his commitment to American workers, and “economic nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-economic-nationalism&quot;&gt;A Stand for Economic Nationalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump addressed his commitment to revitalizing American industries, focusing on automobile manufacturing— a lifeblood of the nation’s economy. He rebuked Biden’s overreliance on foreign batteries and rare-earth mineral mining for electric vehicles. Trump emphasized his commitment to American labor over foreign, stating: “I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empowering-american-workers&quot;&gt;Empowering American Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump communicated directly to a variety of workers including UAW members, assembly line workers, welders, mechanics, and electricians, praising them for their contributions to building the nation. His speech reflected a strong inclination towards sustaining American industry and protecting the interests of American workers. “You built this country. You love this country, and you are the ones that make our country run,” Trump appreciated, calling for a future that raises American wages, fortifies American industry, and builds national pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrasting-visions&quot;&gt;Contrasting Visions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech was clearly intended to contrast his vision of economic nationalism against what he perceives as Biden’s pandering to globalist ideals. He accused Biden of hastily planning a trip to Michigan and condemned the apparent preference of foreign profits over the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-assembly-of-blue-collar-workers&quot;&gt;An Assembly of Blue-Collar Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his address, Trump created a sense of unity and camaraderie among blue-collar workers of Michigan. He was not there merely to criticize Biden’s policies but to reassure the American worker and to salute those “who do not get the credit they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vow-to-make-america-great&quot;&gt;A Vow to Make America Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I side with the autoworkers of America and with those who want to make America great again, and I always will,” Trump vowed, underlining his perpetual allegiance to American workers. He dismissed the electric vehicle push by automakers bending to the Biden administration, calling it a threat to jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation&quot;&gt;A Battle for the Soul of the Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the UAW labor bosses allied with Biden, Trump and his campaign persisted in gathering support from various working-class groups, outlining his vision for a resurgence of economic nationalism. The speech underlined a fundamental dispute between globalism and economic nationalism, a battle for the values, dignity, and soul of the nation, resonating with those who feel overlooked and underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Trump’s energetic assembly in Michigan turned out to be more than just a political rally. It was a symphony of shared values and mutual respect, a stand for the working class against the tide of globalism, reinforcing the hope and dignity of countless Americans. His pledge to the American dream and his battle against globalism reflect a deep-rooted concern for the future of American labor and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump recently elucidated his stance on defending the American working class, contrasting his viewpoint with President Joe Biden’s policies. Speaking to a diverse crowd in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump criticized Biden’s approach to globalism, reaffirming his commitment to American workers, and “economic nationalism.” A Stand for Economic Nationalism Trump addressed his commitment to revitalizing American industries, focusing on automobile manufacturing— a lifeblood of the nation’s economy. He rebuked Biden’s overreliance on foreign batteries and rare-earth mineral mining for electric vehicles. Trump emphasized his commitment to American labor over foreign, stating: “I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor.” Empowering American Workers Trump communicated directly to a variety of workers including UAW members, assembly line workers, welders, mechanics, and electricians, praising them for their contributions to building the nation. His speech reflected a strong inclination towards sustaining American industry and protecting the interests of American workers. “You built this country. You love this country, and you are the ones that make our country run,” Trump appreciated, calling for a future that raises American wages, fortifies American industry, and builds national pride.

&lt;p&gt;Tension was evident when President Joe Biden made a brief appearance among striking United Auto Workers (UAW) in Michigan. This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photop-session-amid-industrial-action&quot;&gt;Photop Session amid Industrial Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce.

Biden’s seemingly dismissive stance was further spotlighted as he announced his visit only after Trump’s planned engagement was made public, raising questions about the genuineness of Biden’s concern for the striking workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

The unsettling detail here is the listing of Joe Biden’s residential address as the beneficiary address for the transactions, raising eyebrows and fueling suspicions regarding the integrity and transparency of the Biden family’s interactions with foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unraveling-the-chinese-connection&quot;&gt;Unraveling the Chinese Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a revelation on Fox News Channel’s “The Ingraham Angle,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-KY) stated that Hunter Biden used his father’s Wilmington home address for a significant transaction. A businessman from China, identified as Jonathan Lee, with known affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, wired $250,000 to Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Ingraham, the anchor, pointed out that the wire transfer forms notably used Joe Biden’s home address. The intricacy of such a detail makes one ponder the extent and nature of the involvement of the Bidens with Chinese businesses and potentially the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-and-suspicions&quot;&gt;Implications and Suspicions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this revelation are profound and potentially harmful, considering the listed home address is that of the sitting President of the United States. If the accusations hold weight, it could severely tarnish the image of the presidency and lead to concerns over national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Joe Biden’s address as the beneficiary’s address at a time when Hunter was allegedly not residing with his father raises questions. This anomaly necessitates a comprehensive inquiry into the reasons behind such a choice of address and the nature of the transactions and relationships involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-player&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Lee, the man behind the wire, is portrayed as a colossal business personality in China, known for his endeavors in representing Chinese interests in the United States, especially in sectors crucial to national security. This raises concerns about the influence and leverage such entities might have over American industries and, more importantly, over individuals in positions of power, such as the Bidens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bipartisan-concerns-over-china&quot;&gt;Bipartisan Concerns Over China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concerns over China’s growing influence and investment in American industries and farmlands is a mutual worry amongst both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The shared viewpoint emphasizes the need for thorough scrutiny and possible regulations to prevent China’s potential dominance over industries vital to American national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biden-lee-meetup&quot;&gt;The Biden-Lee Meetup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen the concerns, it has been unearthed that Joe Biden had had interactions with Jonathan Lee, adding another layer to the already complex and mysterious relationship between the Bidens and Chinese entities.
