A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-19T12:20:37-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T12:20:37-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/19/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump Takes the Lead Over Biden: CNBC Economic Survey Results</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/19/Trump-Biden-Israel-Survey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump Takes the Lead Over Biden: CNBC Economic Survey Results" /><published>2023-10-19T11:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T11:45:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/19/Trump-Biden-Israel-Survey</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/19/Trump-Biden-Israel-Survey/">&lt;p&gt;Recent findings from CNBC’s All-America Economic Survey reveal that if elections were held today, former President Donald Trump would edge out current President Joe Biden by a margin of 4%. The poll, which took place between October 11th and 15th, paints a detailed picture of Americans’ political and economic sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s approval ratings have seen a downturn, with only 37% of Americans showing approval and 58% expressing disapproval. This marks a concerning period for the Biden administration, having the second-lowest approval and second-highest disapproval during his tenure. Particularly concerning for Biden is his approval rating on economic matters, which stands at a mere 32% against a 63% disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, amidst the political tussles, a notable highlight from the survey is the strong American support for Israel. In the aftermath of recent attacks by Hamas on Israel, a whopping 74% of respondents believed it’s crucial for the U.S. to continue providing military aid to Israel. This backing for Israel’s military assistance surpasses support for several other key issues, including securing the U.S.-Mexico border, foreign humanitarian aid at 72%, and military assistance to Ukraine at 61%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Biden’s swift show of support for Israel and promises of additional aid during the conflict did not earn him much favor. Only 31% approved of his handling of foreign policy, and a significant 60% disapproved. Interestingly, this decline isn’t limited to the opposition. Within the Democratic party, Biden’s foreign policy decisions are approved by just 66% of members, and 74% support his economic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also highlights the polarization in the American political landscape. Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, 57% of Republicans lean toward supporting Israelis, in contrast to 29% of Democrats and 27% of independents. Meanwhile, a significant chunk of Democrats (44%) and independents (47%) favor a balanced stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intriguing insight from this study is a shift in sentiment when comparing current data with a 2014 survey. Older Americans, especially those above 35, are now more in favor of supporting Israel than before. Young Americans, aged 18 to 34, seem more inclined towards a neutral stance, with 46% believing both sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict should be treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of government funding priorities, the survey indicated clear party-line preferences. Republicans and independents showed a leaning towards securing the U.S.-Mexico border and then military funding for Israel. Democrats, however, placed military aid for Ukraine and foreign humanitarian aid at the top of their list.&lt;/p&gt;

This law, signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in July 2022, repealed an earlier law banning loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. Its primary aim was to protect transgender women and other vulnerable communities from targeted police harassment. However, it seems the bill may have led to some unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local businesses have borne the brunt of this uptick in overt prostitution activities. Additional security measures have been implemented, with many installing lights to deter unwanted attention. Ironically, prostitutes are now using these very lights to attract customers. A long-time San Diego business owner lamented to Fox News Digital, “Costs for business, costs for security. We’ve had to put lights — at our cost — on the roof…the lights now help them when they want to come in front of my building to shake and do different things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crime related to the prostitution surge is also on the rise. Many business owners have reported break-ins, tire slashing, and thefts, which they believe to be retaliation acts by pimps or prostitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of the issue is the “Safer Streets Act” (Senate Bill 357). The law was designed to prevent the disproportionate harassment of Black and brown women and members of the LGBTQ community. While it doesn’t legalize prostitution, it eliminates provisions that led to the said harassment. Nevertheless, its implementation has led to significant challenges for San Diego’s streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the law took effect in January, many argue that it has empowered prostitutes and pimps, giving them the freedom to openly solicit customers without fear of legal repercussions. This visibility has caused discomfort for many residents, especially parents who must now explain to their young children the sight of near-naked women attempting to flag down vehicles during morning school commutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing issues, many feel that local politicians are not addressing the problem adequately. The business owner shared that no one from the city council’s office has reached out to understand the gravity of the situation or discuss potential solutions. The business owner added, “I have yet to have anybody from the local city council’s office contact anybody here in the neighborhood, come by, try to say, ‘Hey, we’re trying to help. How can we put some resources in like maybe some additional lights, maybe some additional cameras?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mayor’s office maintains that efforts are being made to tackle the problem. Mayor Gloria, who has spoken publicly about the issue, emphasized the police department’s sting operations, which led to numerous arrests earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the challenges posed by SB 357 becoming increasingly evident, many hope for its repeal or at least a revisitation to address its shortcomings. As San Diego struggles, the need for a proactive approach becomes ever more critical to restore peace and security to its streets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">San Diego is currently grappling with a sharp rise in street prostitution, a disturbing trend following the recent implementation of California’s controversial Senate Bill 357.

&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented incident saw the woman rise from her seat and stride towards the area where Trump sat. Expressing a will to assist Trump, her actions raised concerns, albeit momentarily. The court assured that the safety of Trump and others present was never compromised. Lucian Chalfen, a court spokesperson, clarified that she faced arrest due to contempt for disrupting the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Trump seemed unaware of the event, later querying reporters, “Who got arrested? We didn’t know anything about it.” This detachment indicates the intense focus on the allegations made against him by &lt;strong&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump is accused of misleading banks and insurers through exaggerated statements of his net worth and asset values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court employee, upon being apprehended, voiced her distress outside the courtroom. She expressed her rights as an American citizen and as a court employee, emphasizing her presence to support Trump. The woman, however, complied with court officers’ directions and insisted she had been observing the proceedings peacefully. Following the incident, she has been barred from state courts during the ongoing investigations and placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trial resumed, another unusual instance surfaced. Trump displayed apparent frustration, leading to animated discussions with his attorneys. This drew the court’s attention, with Judge Arthur Engoron emphasizing decorum and cautioning against potential attempts to influence testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst these episodes, the core issue remains — the allegations against Trump and his company for defrauding banks and insurers. Evidence presented at the trial indicates that financial statements were pivotal for Trump in securing deals and loans. For instance, a 2015 refinancing offer required the delivery of Trump’s financial statements and tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense sought to challenge claims that Trump’s top corporate deputies inflated property values. An intense exchange occurred as Trump’s lawyer Lazaro Fields questioned real estate appraiser Doug Larson about a projected valuation discrepancy. The trial’s intensity, marked by such heated exchanges, underscores the gravity of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Trump maintains his innocence, asserting that his assets were undervalued and that provided numbers came with disclaimers. Trump has consistently labeled the trial as a political move to hinder his potential return to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

It serves as a testament to how influential figures in the entertainment world can bridge divides and stand by communities during adversities.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">EPA Demands Extended Cleanup After Ohio Train Derailment</title><link href="/news/2023/10/19/EPA-Derailment-Cleanup/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EPA Demands Extended Cleanup After Ohio Train Derailment" /><published>2023-10-19T07:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T07:06:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/19/EPA-Derailment-Cleanup</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/19/EPA-Derailment-Cleanup/">&lt;p&gt;In a recent mandate, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has directed Norfolk Southern Corp. to intensify cleanup operations in East Palestine, Ohio. This comes after the February derailment of a freight train operated by the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern Corp. is now instructed to further investigate the presence of an oily sheen or film observed on water and sediments of two significant creeks in East Palestine. These creeks, known as the Sulphur Run and the &lt;strong&gt;Leslie Run&lt;/strong&gt;, have been showing signs of environmental impact post the mishap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA’s spokesperson stated, “The work executed following this order will essentially determine the need for further cleanup to negate any possible long-term repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated in February when the train, approaching the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, derailed, leading to a colossal fire. To manage the aftermath, Ohio performed a controlled release of hazardous chemicals at the site merely three days post the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide a clearer picture of the extent of the environmental damage, the EPA’s investigation aims to span approximately five miles, focusing especially on the affected sections of the mentioned creeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA Regional Administrator, Debra Shore emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating, “With this directive, Norfolk Southern is expected to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the waterways, ensuring there are zero long-term adverse effects stemming from the derailment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restoration strategy also encompasses the cleaning of various culverts. This is to eliminate any affected sediment in Sulphur Run, particularly downstream of where the derailment transpired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the new mandate, Norfolk Southern Corp. expressed its intent to collaborate, remarking that this directive essentially “formalizes the work that has been in progress post the derailment, albeit under a distinct regulatory framework.” The company reiterated its commitment, highlighting its ongoing collaboration with both the EPA and Ohio EPA. They concluded by assuring their relentless efforts to mitigate the derailment’s impacts on the Sulphur and Leslie Runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative by the EPA reflects the agency’s continued commitment to protecting and preserving environmental quality, especially in the aftermath of unforeseen incidents. It also showcases the importance of corporate responsibility in addressing environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a recent mandate, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has directed Norfolk Southern Corp. to intensify cleanup operations in East Palestine, Ohio.

His wife, Nadine Menendez, along with three other co-defendants, has pleaded not guilty to the allegations in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges revolve around a supposed &lt;strong&gt;bribery scheme&lt;/strong&gt; that involves Senator Menendez, his wife, and businessmen Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes. Accusations detail that these individuals participated in a plot benefiting both Senator Menendez and the Egyptian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intricacies of the case date back to 2018 through 2022, with the indictment suggesting a “corrupt relationship” between Menendez, his wife, and the mentioned businessmen. Allegedly, the couple accepted vast sums - totaling “hundreds of thousands of dollars” - in bribes. In return, Senator Menendez purportedly leveraged his senatorial influence to support and enrich the three businessmen and the Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Senator is unwavering in his stand, asserting his loyalty and commitment to the United States. He expressed his commitment to “human rights and democracy in Egypt” and vehemently denied the allegations. Senator Menendez emphasized his history of challenging Egypt’s leadership on human rights matters and declared his unyielding allegiance to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” stated Menendez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further labeled the new charges as mere tactics to wear him down but remains determined to defend his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Piling new charge upon new charge does not make the allegations true… I again ask people who know me and my record to give me the chance to present my defense and show my innocence,” Menendez voiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while the senator’s wife and the businessmen face the recent charges head-on, Senator Menendez himself is slated for another court appearance on Monday. This rescheduling follows an additional charge, termed a “superseding indictment,” brought against him, his wife, and Hana, a New Jersey businessman of Egyptian origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high-profile case continues to capture national attention, with implications for the Democratic party and the broader political landscape. As investigations proceed and the courtroom drama unfolds, all eyes are set on the final verdict and its repercussions on Senator Menendez’s political career.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">A significant development has emerged in the ongoing bribery scandal involving Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey.

Former President Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over current President Joe Biden, while businessman and Navy SEAL veteran Tim Sheehy is poised to challenge Senator Jon Tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emerson College Poll, unveiled on Tuesday, delves into hypothetical election scenarios and Montana’s political landscape. The numbers indicate that 49% of Montana’s registered voters would back Trump, compared to Biden’s 28% in a prospective 2020 rerun. Diving deeper, 16% would opt for another contender, leaving a mere 7% on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same poll paints a dim picture for Biden’s performance, with only 22% endorsing his presidency. A whopping 63% disapprove, casting a cloud over his standing in the Treasure State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When posed with the hypothetical question of changing allegiance in the next few months, 53% of Trump enthusiasts appear unwavering in their commitment, believing Trump can do no wrong. Conversely, a slightly lesser 48% of Biden supporters echo this steadfast loyalty. The remaining voters are susceptible to swaying, given certain actions or statements by their initially preferred candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching gears to the Senate race, Sheehy, armed with several Republican senator endorsements, presents a noteworthy challenge to Tester. Tester, currently in his third senatorial term, attracts 39% of voter support. Yet, Sheehy, relatively green in the political arena, is hot on his heels with 35%. A noteworthy 20% remain undecided, with the remaining 6% leaning towards other candidates. Significantly, the differences are within the 4.6% credibility margin for registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerson’s findings underline a distinct gender divide in voter preference. Tester commands the women’s vote with a lead of 16 points (46% to 30%), while Sheehy secures a 40% to 32% lead among men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) is rumored to be mulling a bid for Tester’s seat. However, Trump has previously indicated he wouldn’t support Rosendale in a primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this Emerson College poll was conducted from October 1-4, encompassing views of 499 Montanans, 447 of whom are registered voters. The credibility interval stands at 4.4% for the total sample and 4.6% for registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such results, the upcoming elections promise a heated and tight race, and Montana will undoubtedly be a state to watch in the political arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">New polling results present interesting political dynamics for Montana.

His stance? Leave it to the voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Newsmax town hall held in Iowa, Pence conveyed his belief that decisions concerning Trump’s alleged interference in the 2020 election results should be determined by the voters and not the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject is deeply personal for Pence, as he recalled the events of January 6, 2021, a day he labeled a “tragic day”. On this date, Pence oversaw the Congress’ certification of the Electoral College, during which the Capitol Building experienced a breach by protesters. Speaking on the event, Pence expressed, “By God’s grace, I did my duty that day under the Constitution of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pence’s stance on the handling of Trump’s fate is distinct from the general political discourse. He voiced his hope that “issues around the president’s conduct and actions on that day and leading up to that day would be left to the judgment of the American people and not be brought into the courts of this country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes amidst Trump facing legal repercussions, with a four-count indictment in Washington, D.C., and a 13-count indictment in Georgia. Both relate to his alleged endeavors to overturn the 2020 election results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Trump and Pence has shown signs of strain, primarily due to differences in their recounting of events on January 6th. Pence maintains that Trump had urged him to reverse the voters’ decision, while Trump insists that he simply wanted a delay in certification to further investigate claims of voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing his past relationship with Trump, Pence stated, “We haven’t talked in a while, but we used to talk and work together every day for the better part of five years in a campaign and in our administration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the palpable tension and the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, Pence maintains his belief that voters, and not legal systems, should be the final arbiters. He concluded, “I’d like to see these issues resolved by voters, by the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former Vice President and current Republican presidential candidate, Mike Pence, shared his perspective on how former President Donald Trump’s actions surrounding the 2020 election should be judged.
