A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">China’s Land Grabs in US - An Undeniable Threat to National Security</title><link href="/news/2023/09/19/China-National-Security-Concern/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="China’s Land Grabs in US - An Undeniable Threat to National Security" /><published>2023-09-19T17:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T17:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/19/China-National-Security-Concern</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/19/China-National-Security-Concern/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Footprint on American Soil Raises Red Flags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese companies buying up land on American soil are not just any companies; they have strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Rep. John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan, sees this as a ticking time bomb for U.S. national security. His warning? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen needs to recognize the grave implications of these purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Threat in Michigan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Gotion Inc., a company deeply linked to the CCP, acquired a sizable plot of 270 acres in Michigan. Their intention is to build a $2.4 billion battery plant. Alarmingly, this location is just a stone’s throw (about 100 miles) from Camp Grayling, America’s most expansive National Guard training facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s even more startling? Michigan is set to offer Gotion a whopping $175 million in grants and tax exemptions that would save them a staggering $540 million over 30 years. This is taxpayer money potentially aiding a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand for Tighter Scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Moolenaar, being a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, is urging for a thorough review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). This body exists to vet foreign investments in the U.S., particularly when there’s a whisper of national security risk. “National security is at stake,” Moolenaar emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Moolenaar penned a letter to Yellen. Their clear-cut request? Block companies affiliated with the CCP from benefiting from the tax incentives outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotion, attempting to circumvent full oversight, has requested a CFIUS review—but solely on the land buy, excluding their actual plans for the acquired territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Pattern of Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated incident. Last year, the Fufeng Group, another firm tied to the CCP, had intentions to acquire 300 acres near the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. Though CFIUS claimed a lack of jurisdiction to scrutinize the deal, the U.S. military rightly intervened to halt the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Moolenaar fervently hopes for the Treasury Department’s proactive engagement this time. In his words, “This isn’t mere business. It’s about the very heart of our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">China’s Footprint on American Soil Raises Red Flags The Chinese companies buying up land on American soil are not just any companies; they have strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The upcoming film, “Route 60: The Biblical Highway”, is set to take audiences on a captivating tour of these ancient landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;route-60---bridging-the-past-and-the-present&quot;&gt;“Route 60” - Bridging The Past And The Present&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film showcases a 150-mile stretch in Israel, from Nazareth in the north to Beersheba in the south, commonly referred to as Route 60. This is the same path that figures such as Abraham and Jesus are believed to have walked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey is guided by former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and David Friedman, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel. With Pompeo’s Christian background and Friedman’s Jewish heritage, viewers will get dual perspectives on the rich history embedded in this sacred land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/672/378/Highway-4.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mike Pompeo and David Friedman exploring biblical sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insights-and-reflections&quot;&gt;Insights and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the movie, Friedman emphasizes the significance of Route 60, calling it “the road that Abraham, the father of nations, walked” and highlighting its centrality to Christian beliefs due to its association with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film doesn’t just focus on the spiritual; it draws parallels between biblical history and modern American politics. Moreover, with both guides having served under the Trump administration, there’s also a recounting of some key Middle East diplomatic milestones, including the landmark Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;landmarks-and-discoveries&quot;&gt;Landmarks and Discoveries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewers will be transported to the City of David in Jerusalem, where Jesus is believed to have healed a blind man. The team also visits Rachel’s tomb near Bethlehem, shedding light on its significance in Jewish traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable mention is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, venerated as the burial place of Jesus Christ. Pompeo, familiar with Christian history, introduces audiences to the Garden of Gethsemane, the place Jesus visited after the Last Supper and where he was later arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contemporary-resonance&quot;&gt;Contemporary Resonance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the historical and spiritual journey, the film touches upon present-day conflicts. Route 60 traverses through Judea and Samaria, areas rich with biblical history but also centers of modern-day disputes between Palestinians and Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is touted by Friedman as “a very uplifting and spiritually invigorating film” and is sure to resonate with those intrigued by biblical history, as well as those keen on understanding its impact on today’s geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first eight months of 2023, there’s been a notable rise in public-sector job offerings. As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates an addition of 327,000 positions in the public sector. This impressive number represents almost 20% of all new jobs created this year, a significant leap from the mere 5% of total employment growth witnessed in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the Sudden Jump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that contributed to this growth. For one, the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 witnessed a similar hiring spree, when the U.S. government was on a hiring spree to address public safety concerns. Julia Pollak, an economist at the popular online job platform ZipRecruiter, made this insightful comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic saw a vast number of teachers, police officers, and other essential public workers stepping away from their roles. This left a massive void in the public sector, which is now being filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Border Patrol Ups Its Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear illustration of the public sector’s aggressive hiring approach can be seen in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s recent activities. They’ve strengthened their presence along the Mexico border. As part of their recruitment strategy, they’re offering attractive bonuses and other enticing incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of incentives, job postings on ZipRecruiter for government roles this year are showcasing salaries that are roughly 20% higher than what they were in 2022. This substantial bump in salary offerings is bound to make these roles more appealing to job seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Word of Caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this growth in the public sector is commendable, economists and HR leaders sound a word of caution. If the economy were to falter, resulting in budget deficits, the current momentum in public sector hiring could face significant challenges. Economic shortfalls could hinder governments’ ability to recruit for new positions in the future, making it imperative to monitor the situation closely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A New Dawn for Public Sector Employment In the first eight months of 2023, there’s been a notable rise in public-sector job offerings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Unwavering Support for the Working Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources, including Breitbart News and The New York Times, have confirmed Trump’s forthcoming appearance with UAW members, as they strike against automotive giants — General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. This bold move is seen as a counter to the GOP debate scheduled at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the union’s strike centers around higher wages amidst rising inflation and ensuring job security in President Joe Biden’s shifting vehicle agenda. Trump is slated to deliver a prime-time speech to current and former union members, highlighting these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strategic Move With A Broader Goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Trump has opted for such a strategy. Instead of attending the first GOP debate, he chose a one-on-one with Tucker Carlson, the host of the “Tucker on Twitter” show. This move generated significant attention, underscoring Trump’s distinctive style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe Trump’s approach is centered less on the GOP primaries and more on a potential general election rematch against President Biden. Historically, union workers, traditionally aligned with Democrats, played a crucial role in electing Trump in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

Already in the public eye for allegedly poisoning her husband with a lethal cocktail, she’s now accused of attempting to fabricate evidence by urging her brother to provide a false testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-twist-in-the-tale&quot;&gt;A Twist in the Tale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summit County officials stumbled upon a six-page letter in Richins’ jail cell that was addressed to her mother, Lisa Darden. Within the letter, Richins claims her attorney, Skye Lazaro, was seeking to establish a connection linking the drugs that poisoned her husband to Mexico. She then urged her brother, Ronald “Ronney” Darden, to provide testimony about Eric Richins’ supposed trips to Mexico to purchase painkillers and the lethal drug, fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an almost flippant tone, she wrote about the need to connect the drugs to Mexico, concluding with the statement “Upon information and belief LOL.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, prosecutors firmly state there is no existing connection between Eric Richins, Mexico, and the fatal fentanyl dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-motive-for-murder&quot;&gt;A Motive for Murder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that Kouri’s motive was financial gain. Records indicate she took out four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins, her husband, amounting to over $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On the first day of 2022, months before the tragic event, she changed the beneficiary of Eric’s $2 million life insurance policy to herself, without his consent. Notably, Eric had revised his will prior to his death, removing Kouri and naming his sister as the primary beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family members expressed concerns about Kouri’s intentions, recalling Eric’s fears for his life, especially after he believed she tried to poison him twice before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple’s relationship was also strained due to financial disagreements. Kouri had aspirations of purchasing and flipping a $2 million mansion for profit, while Eric viewed it as an overly costly venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disturbing-aftermath&quot;&gt;A Disturbing Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Eric’s untimely demise, Kouri penned a children’s book titled “Are You With Me?” dealing with the theme of death. Available for $14.99 on Amazon, the book claims to assist children in navigating the complexities of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the recent discoveries, it appears there’s much more to this case than meets the eye.

Family members expressed concerns about Kouri’s intentions, recalling Eric’s fears for his life, especially after he believed she tried to poison him twice before. The couple’s relationship was also strained due to financial disagreements. Kouri had aspirations of purchasing and flipping a $2 million mansion for profit, while Eric viewed it as an overly costly venture. A Disturbing Aftermath Post Eric’s untimely demise, Kouri penned a children’s book titled “Are You With Me?” dealing with the theme of death. Available for $14.99 on Amazon, the book claims to assist children in navigating the complexities of loss. Given the recent discoveries, it appears there’s much more to this case than meets the eye. As investigations continue, the tragic tale of a family torn apart by greed and deception unfolds.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tim Ballard, Inspiration Behind ‘Sound of Freedom’, Faces Serious Accusations</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/19/Tim-Ballard-Controversy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tim Ballard, Inspiration Behind ‘Sound of Freedom’, Faces Serious Accusations" /><published>2023-09-19T12:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T12:07:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/19/Tim-Ballard-Controversy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/19/Tim-Ballard-Controversy/">&lt;p&gt;Tim Ballard, whose life inspired the blockbuster film &lt;em&gt;Sound of Freedom&lt;/em&gt;, has come under the spotlight – but not for his cinematic portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vice News recently brought to light accusations of sexual misconduct against Ballard, an anti-child trafficking activist. At the heart of the allegations are claims made by anonymous sources, indicating that at least seven women have voiced complaints against Ballard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;murky-details-amid-a-hit-movie&quot;&gt;Murky Details Amid a Hit Movie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women, believed to be central to these allegations, either haven’t responded to or have declined to comment on the Vice report. Ballard previously stepped down from his brainchild, Operation Underground Railroad, due to a separate investigation into similar misconduct claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rather startling detail, it was alleged that Ballard persuaded women to act as his “wife” during undercover missions abroad, which were directed at rescuing sex trafficking victims. Ballard allegedly pressured these women to share a bed or even shower together, under the pretext that it was essential to deceive the traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization, Operation Underground Railroad, acknowledged the allegations by stating they’ve employed an independent law firm to thoroughly investigate these claims. This inquiry remains underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;politics-and-podcasts&quot;&gt;Politics and Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these swirling allegations, there are whispers about Ballard’s political ambitions, suggesting he might be contemplating a run for the Utah U.S. Senate seat, potentially replacing Sen. Mitt Romney (R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballard’s political leanings are also garnering attention, given his alliance with former President Trump, even featuring him on his podcast. Recently, at a public gathering, Ballard seemed to refute the Vice News accusations, stating emphatically, “It’s not true, nothing you hear is true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more. An “anonymous letter” has allegedly been making rounds within Utah’s philanthropic circles over the past few months. This letter further accuses Ballard of sexual harassment, echoing some of Vice’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cinematic-success-amid-real-life-drama&quot;&gt;A Cinematic Success Amid Real-Life Drama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, amidst all this real-world drama, &lt;em&gt;Sound of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; became a surprise hit this summer, raking in nearly $200 million domestically. This performance overshadowed several major studio releases, including Disney’s new Indiana Jones sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

The disappearance of this state-of-the-art aircraft led to an immediate search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-puzzling-disappearance&quot;&gt;A Puzzling Disappearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon investigating the incident, military officials from Joint Base Charleston revealed a significant finding. A debris field was discovered in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. However, it’s still unconfirmed whether the debris belongs to the missing F-35 jet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the pilot, during an unspecified “mishap,” safely ejected from the jet on Sunday. Fortunately, after landing on the ground, the pilot received medical attention at a nearby center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the debris discovery, Joint Base Charleston made an announcement about a shift in responsibility. The United States Marine Corps will now take charge of the ongoing investigation into this incident. The primary objective? To understand the circumstances leading to the “mishap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the safety of the local community, officials urge residents to steer clear of the area where the debris was found. With the incident currently under active investigation, further details remain scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s concerning, however, is the Marine Corps’ decision to halt operations temporarily. This two-day break will focus on discussing “aviation safety matters and best practices.” This comes on the back of three Class-A aviation “mishaps” occurring in the last six weeks. The pause will allow Marines to reevaluate and ensure proper flight procedures, maintenance standards, and overall combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-time-of-reflection&quot;&gt;A Time of Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a press release, the Marine Corps explained the purpose of this operational pause. It serves to emphasize the importance of safety and operational standards, ensuring that pilots, crews, and aircraft maintain peak readiness. This measure aims to protect both the personnel and the public while preserving the Marine Corps’ status as a formidable and well-trained force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the investigation unfolds, it’s crucial to stay updated with the developments.

While MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi has labeled Meadows’ defense in the Georgia RICO case as “laughable,” it’s evident that the story is more nuanced than just the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meadows’ Defense: A Double-Edged Sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace emphasized the perception that Meadows is backed by strong legal counsel, suggesting that perhaps this sentiment has been blown out of proportion. Frank Figliuzzi weighed in, noting, “He does have a respected lawyer. The lesson is you can’t out-lawyer crime.” He indicated that Meadows’ efforts in the legal realm might encounter significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figliuzzi hinted at potential cooperation between Meadows and investigators, suggesting that Meadows might be in a difficult spot. And while this is pure speculation, such high-profile cases often come with a myriad of challenges. Meadows’ ability to navigate these will be under keen observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram clash, Hollywood actress Halle Berry voiced her disapproval when rapper Drake and singer SZA used a 2012 photograph of her to promote their fresh track “Slime You Out.” What’s the catch? They did it without asking her first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-slimy-situation&quot;&gt;The Slimy Situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial photo features Berry at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, where she is seen covered from head to toe in the iconic green slime. As it is customary at the Kids’ Choice Awards, celebrities often end up covered in this playful goop. But for Berry, the problem wasn’t the slime – it was its unexpected and unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, both Drake and SZA gave their fans a sneak peek of the song on their Instagram accounts, where they shared the slimed snapshot of Berry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry didn’t remain silent. On her own Instagram, she shared a mysterious message: “SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER GUY…EVEN IF YOU’RE A WOMAN!” Diving into the comments section, Berry further revealed her feelings, saying, “Didn’t get my permission,” and “That’s not cool I thought better of him!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further emphasized, “When people you admire disappoint you you have to be the bigger person and move on!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silence-from-the-stars&quot;&gt;The Silence from the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy, representatives for all three – Berry, Drake, and SZA – haven’t made any public statements addressing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
