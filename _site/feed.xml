A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/25/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-25T08:30:24-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-25T08:30:24-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/25/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/25/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Shocking Replacement: Los Angeles Hotels Accused of Trading Union Workers for Border Crossers</title><link href="/news/2023/10/25/Los-Angeles-Hotels-Union-Workers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shocking Replacement: Los Angeles Hotels Accused of Trading Union Workers for Border Crossers" /><published>2023-10-25T08:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-25T08:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/25/Los-Angeles-Hotels-Union-Workers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/25/Los-Angeles-Hotels-Union-Workers/">&lt;p&gt;Hotels situated in the sanctuary confines of Los Angeles County, California, stand accused of substituting their unionized workforce — presently on strike — with newly arrived border crossers and undocumented immigrants. This severe allegation has caught the attention of legal authorities, prompting the District Attorney’s Office to initiate an official investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospitality industry of Los Angeles finds itself in turmoil as hotel workers, represented by Unite Here Local 11, allege their employers of engaging in the unethical practice of replacing them with fresh border arrivals and illegal aliens. These replacements are reportedly sourced mainly from Venezuela and Colombia, having entered the United States via the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of the controversy lies with the hotels allegedly targeting individuals residing in Skid Row, a notorious area of Los Angeles. Hotels are accused of exploiting these newly arrived individuals, offering them low-wage employment opportunities as an alternative to the striking unionized workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News reports indicate that since the commencement of intermittent strikes in early July, involving more than 15,000 workers across approximately 60 Southern California hotels, employers have resorted to filling the labor void with a mix of managers, temporary workers, and those recruited via staffing agencies, digital platforms like Instawork, and other means. Specific hotels named in these allegations include the Four Points by Sheraton, Holiday Inn LAX, and Le Meridien Delfina Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah Peterson, an organizer with Unite Here Local 11, highlighted that some of the individuals hired at the Le Meridien Delfina were part of the migrant groups transported to L.A. on buses by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. This act, deemed a political stunt, was aimed at spotlighting the challenges sanctuary cities face and criticizing immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office now actively investigating these serious claims, those who have information or have been affected are urged to come forward. District Attorney George Gascon expressed his commitment to addressing these allegations, stating, “We take these egregious allegations with the utmost seriousness. The mistreatment of vulnerable workers and their exploitation will not be tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the nation’s largest sanctuary state, California currently hosts nearly five million illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges intertwined with immigration, labor rights, and ethical employment practices, bringing them to the forefront of public and legal discourse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Hotels situated in the sanctuary confines of Los Angeles County, California, stand accused of substituting their unionized workforce — presently on strike — with newly arrived border crossers and undocumented immigrants.

&lt;p&gt;Paramount Pictures made the announcement this Monday, shifting the release date of the next ‘Mission: Impossible’ film from its original slot on June 28 to a new date on May 23, 2025. The halt in production can be traced back to July, when lead actor Tom Cruise and the rest of the crew took a break for an international promotion tour for ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequel, previously titled ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two’, is now simply listed as ‘Mission: Impossible’. Despite the prior installment’s success, grossing a substantial $567.5 million worldwide, it fell short of its predecessor, ‘Fallout’ ($791.7 million globally), and Cruise’s other major hit, ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ ($1.5 billion). The 163-minute-long action thriller received high praise, yet it quickly found itself overshadowed by blockbuster giants ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actor strike has not just impacted the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise; it is sending ripples throughout Hollywood, upsetting release plans for other major films. From this fall’s ‘Dune: Part Two’ being postponed to March, to delays and indefinite postponements of various Marvel and ‘Venom’ films, and even ‘Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse’, the industry is in a state of flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these delays, Paramount Pictures has also adjusted the release schedule for other titles in their lineup. ‘A Quiet Place: Day One’, a prequel to the popular post-apocalyptic horror series and featuring Lupita Nyong’o, has had its release pushed from March to June 28, filling the slot originally occupied by ‘Mission: Impossible’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the studios are set to resume this Tuesday, leaving Hollywood and its eager audience in anticipation of what resolution—or further delays—may come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Hollywood is facing a major shakeup as the highly anticipated eighth installment of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise gets hit with a year-long delay, all due to the ongoing actors strike that has now surpassed a staggering three months of work stoppage.

This surge in violence marks a significant escalation in the region, raising concerns over the safety of U.S. personnel and the broader implications for stability in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon, through Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, confirmed that between October 17 and 24, U.S. forces in Iraq were targeted 11 times, while their counterparts in Syria faced three attacks. Officials are pointing fingers at Iran, noting the presence of “Iranian fingerprints” on the attacks, though they have stopped short of directly accusing the Iranian government of orchestrating the violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The varied nature of the attacks, including both drone strikes and rocket fire, illustrates the complex threat landscape in the region. Al-Asad air base in Iraq has been a particular focus, enduring multiple attacks over the week. The base faced a rocket attack on October 18, resulting in injuries to four individuals and causing damage to the facility. Additionally, U.S. forces engaged two drones in the vicinity, successfully neutralizing one and damaging the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the situation, a U.S. civilian contractor suffered a fatal heart attack during a false alarm at the same base, highlighting the intense pressure and danger that these service members and affiliated personnel are under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon is taking these threats seriously, with 2,000 troops now on a 24-hour notice to deploy, ready to respond to any further escalations. The attacks have not gone unanswered, with U.S. forces actively engaging and mitigating threats as they arise. On October 19, the USS Carney in the northern Red Sea successfully defended against a barrage of land attack cruise missiles and drones launched by Houthi forces in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relentless nature of these attacks, occurring across multiple locations and involving a variety of tactics, underscores the precarious position of U.S. forces in the Middle East. It also serves as a stark reminder of the region’s instability and the constant vigilance required to protect U.S. interests and personnel abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Pentagon officials continue to assess the situation and respond to these threats, the safety of U.S. troops remains a top priority.

Larry Hogan Withdraws from Harvard Fellowships Amid Antisemitic Tensions</title><link href="/news/2023/10/24/Antisemitism-Harvard/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Withdraws from Harvard Fellowships Amid Antisemitic Tensions" /><published>2023-10-24T15:24:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-24T15:24:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/24/Antisemitism-Harvard</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/24/Antisemitism-Harvard/">&lt;p&gt;Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has taken a firm stance against antisemitism, deciding to withdraw from two esteemed fellowship programs at Harvard University. Hogan, a Republican and a notable figure in American politics, had accepted fellowships at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogan’s decision is a direct response to what he describes as “anti-Semitic vitriol” permeating the campus, following the deadly attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7. In a candid letter to Harvard, which Hogan shared on his social media platforms, he expressed his initial excitement about joining the Harvard community and his eagerness to impart leadership lessons to the next generation of leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Hogan’s enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment as he witnessed the university’s reaction—or lack thereof—to the surge of antisemitic sentiments on campus. Over 30 Harvard student organizations openly blamed Israel for the Hamas-initiated attack, prompting Hogan to reassess his association with the prestigious institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I cannot condone the dangerous anti-Semitism that has taken root on your campus,” Hogan stated in his letter, highlighting the severity of the attack as the “greatest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust.” He called for universal condemnation of the attack, emphasizing its fundamentally evil nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student statement, released on the day of the attack, held the Israeli regime entirely responsible for the violence, outlining the longstanding tensions and challenges faced by Palestinians in Gaza. The statement quickly ignited national backlash, with business leaders pledging not to employ the students involved and some even rescinding job offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard’s administration, led by President Claudine Gay, was quick to denounce Hamas’ violence and clarify that student groups do not speak on behalf of the university. However, Hogan argued that this response was not sufficient, stating that while students have the right to free speech, they should not be allowed to propagate hate speech without challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogan’s withdrawal from the Harvard fellowship programs sends a powerful message about the importance of standing against antisemitism and holding educational institutions accountable for their response to hate speech. As Hogan concludes his letter, he expresses his hope that his decision will prompt Harvard to take meaningful action against antisemitism and uphold the values it should represent to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has taken a firm stance against antisemitism, deciding to withdraw from two esteemed fellowship programs at Harvard University.

This closed-door session raises significant questions about the integrity of the investigation and the role of politics in judicial proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, Martin Estrada, is scheduled to be interviewed on Tuesday, followed by DOJ Tax Division attorney Stuart Goldberg on Wednesday. These interviews are a response to allegations of politicization and misconduct at the Justice Department agencies throughout the years-long investigation into President Joe Biden’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has been pushing for months to have federal prosecutors involved in the Biden investigation testify before his committee. These negotiations have been fraught, reflecting the high stakes and political tensions surrounding the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Counsel David Weiss, overseeing the government’s investigation into Biden, is also expected to appear for a transcribed interview on Nov. 7, behind closed doors. The Justice Department had initially offered Weiss for public testimony back in July, indicating a preference for transparency, but this closed-door session suggests a more confidential approach is being taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allegations that politics have influenced or hampered prosecutorial decisions in the investigation have led to heightened scrutiny, with Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, taking on the role of special counsel. He has been leading the Biden investigation since 2018, and his appointment as special counsel aims to address concerns about the impartiality of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first move as special counsel, Weiss charged Hunter Biden with making false statements related to a firearm purchase and possession of a firearm by a person using controlled substances. Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development comes amid House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry against President Biden, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape. The status of this inquiry remains uncertain following the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political drama unfolds, the nation’s eyes are on the House Judiciary Committee and the closed-door interviews set to take place this week. The outcomes of these interviews may have significant implications for the Hunter Biden investigation, the integrity of the judicial process, and the broader political discourse in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a highly anticipated move, federal prosecutors are set to appear for transcribed interviews at the House Judiciary Committee this week, as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged political bias in the Hunter Biden probe. This closed-door session raises significant questions about the integrity of the investigation and the role of politics in judicial proceedings. U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, Martin Estrada, is scheduled to be interviewed on Tuesday, followed by DOJ Tax Division attorney Stuart Goldberg on Wednesday. These interviews are a response to allegations of politicization and misconduct at the Justice Department agencies throughout the years-long investigation into President Joe Biden’s son. The move comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has been pushing for months to have federal prosecutors involved in the Biden investigation testify before his committee. These negotiations have been fraught, reflecting the high stakes and political tensions surrounding the investigation. Special Counsel David Weiss, overseeing the government’s investigation into Biden, is also expected to appear for a transcribed interview on Nov. 7, behind closed doors. The Justice Department had initially offered Weiss for public testimony back in July, indicating a preference for transparency, but this closed-door session suggests a more confidential approach is being taken. The allegations that politics have influenced or hampered prosecutorial decisions in the investigation have led to heightened scrutiny, with Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, taking on the role of special counsel. He has been leading the Biden investigation since 2018, and his appointment as special counsel aims to address concerns about the impartiality of the investigation. In his first move as special counsel, Weiss charged Hunter Biden with making false statements related to a firearm purchase and possession of a firearm by a person using controlled substances. Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the investigation continues. This development comes amid House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry against President Biden, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape. The status of this inquiry remains uncertain following the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker. As the political drama unfolds, the nation’s eyes are on the House Judiciary Committee and the closed-door interviews set to take place this week. The outcomes of these interviews may have significant implications for the Hunter Biden investigation, the integrity of the judicial process, and the broader political discourse in the United States.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Perry Johnson Throws Support Behind Trump for 2024 Presidential Bid</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/24/Perry-Johnson-Trump-Endorsement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Perry Johnson Throws Support Behind Trump for 2024 Presidential Bid" /><published>2023-10-24T12:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-24T12:57:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/24/Perry-Johnson-Trump-Endorsement</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/24/Perry-Johnson-Trump-Endorsement/">&lt;p&gt;Perry Johnson, a self-funded businessman from Michigan who recently suspended his own presidential campaign, has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election. Johnson’s endorsement comes as a surprise to many, given his previous criticisms of corruption within the Republican National Committee (RNC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson made his endorsement public through a statement on social media this Monday, stating, “After suspending my campaign for President on Friday, there is now only one candidate in this race who can provide a solution to our nation’s economic, foreign policy and social crises, and most importantly, beat [President] Joe Biden at the ballot box. That person is Donald Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing the need for unity among conservatives, Johnson added, “I look forward to assisting in efforts to elect him next year and uniting with other conservatives to defeat Joe Biden in November.” This statement marks a clear shift in Johnson’s political strategy, aligning himself with Trump’s influential base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week, Johnson expressed his dissatisfaction with the RNC, accusing leaders of corruption and emphasizing the importance of democracy. “The corruption among leaders at the RNC during this process was appalling. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the people should decide the next president of the United States, not the head of the RNC and her cronies,” Johnson remarked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This endorsement is especially noteworthy in light of Johnson’s previous failed attempt to run for governor of Michigan, where he faced legal challenges over the authenticity of signatures on his petition. The court eventually ruled against him, marking a setback in his political career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, aligning with Trump, Johnson seems poised to reestablish himself in the political arena, contributing to the efforts to unseat President Joe Biden in the upcoming election. This move also highlights the continuing influence of Donald Trump within the Republican Party, as he garners support from former rivals in his pursuit of returning to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Johnson’s endorsement of Trump adds an interesting dynamic to the political landscape, emphasizing the high stakes and shifting alliances that define modern American politics. With the nation’s eyes on the Republican Party and its potential candidates, Johnson’s support for Trump is sure to play a significant role in shaping the discourse and strategies leading up to the election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Perry Johnson, a self-funded businessman from Michigan who recently suspended his own presidential campaign, has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election.

This move underscores the complexity of modern warfare, where battles are fought not just with weapons but with information and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ByteDance, a Beijing-based company, owns Douyin, and it seems to have become a platform for the Iranian embassy in China to express its views and garner support. Newsweek’s recent coverage highlights the embassy’s sympathetic stance toward Hamas, particularly in relation to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel. The embassy’s account goes further to lay blame on the United States and Israel, accusing them of aiming to obliterate Hamas’ control over the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the conflict’s inception, the embassy has strategically used short, impactful videos to draw attention to the destruction in Gaza, attracting hundreds of thousands of views. Some videos explicitly label Israel as a “terrorist” nation, while others share footage of explosion aftermaths, blaming Israel for the devastation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular post shared by the embassy features footage from the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City post-explosion. The embassy attributes the destruction to Israel, despite U.S. intelligence indicating that the damage was actually caused by a failed rocket launch by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, a group closely aligned with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a blatant display of antisemitism, another Iranian post on Douyin depicts rockets raining down on Gaza, emanating from the hair of a grotesque caricature of a Jewish person. This sort of hateful content is not only spreading misinformation but also fostering animosity and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amplifying Iran’s propaganda efforts, Chinese state media outlets have reposted and supported the Iranian embassy’s claims on Sina Weibo, another popular social media platform in China. The concerted efforts of these entities have led to a significant increase in the embassy’s influence on Douyin, now boasting over 1.3 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing, while maintaining robust political and trade relationships with Iran, presents itself as a peace broker in the Middle East conflict. However, it’s crucial to highlight that the country has yet to denounce Hamas’ actions or its connections to Iran, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. This silence speaks volumes and raises questions about the role of propaganda in modern geopolitics, as well as the responsibility of social media platforms in curbing the spread of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The digital space is the new battlefield for geopolitical conflicts, and the latest reports reveal a disturbing trend: Iran is actively using Douyin, the Chinese counterpart of TikTok, to spread propaganda about the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel.

The U.S. Marshals, backed by SWAT teams, experienced gunfire through a closed apartment door, escalating the situation to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon breaching the apartment, officers discovered 23-year-old Christian Williams, a suspect in a 2021 murder case who vanished under mysterious circumstances seven months ago. The suspect was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and is currently in critical condition at a local hospital. This incident marks the first time Williams has been seen since his reported abduction on March 6, just hours before his scheduled court appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams is suspected of assisting Joey Fournier (52), Chavis Stokes (29), Marc K. Anderson (24), and Johnifer Barnwell (37) in their escape from Bibbs County Jail. The inmates managed a daring escape, climbing out of a damaged window and cutting through a fence before making their getaway in a blue Dodge Challenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the suspected getaway vehicle in a parking lot near the jail has not brought the fugitives any closer to capture, as the search continues into its second week. The Bibb County Sheriff’s Office, while releasing few details, has confirmed that Williams’s involvement in the jailbreak is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, present at the scene, was arrested and charged with felony aiding or permitting another to escape lawful custody or confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current status of the escaped inmates remains uncertain, with the Bibb County Sheriff admitting during a press conference that “They could be anywhere…But how long they stay together or even if they’re together at this point: We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement has placed a $73,000 reward on the heads of the fugitives, a combination of contributions from the FBI, Macon Regional Crime Stoppers, U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tumultuous incident shines a spotlight on the intricate and often dangerous nature of manhunts, underscoring the lengths to which law enforcement will go to apprehend escapees and solve outstanding cases. As the situation continues to develop, the public and law enforcement alike are left on edge, wondering where the escapees will turn up next and what further revelations this intense manhunt will bring to light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The search for four escaped Georgia inmates took a violent turn, leading armed law enforcement teams straight to the doorstep of a missing murder suspect, resulting in a confrontation that ended in gunfire.
