A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">U.S. Economy Surprises with 336,000 New Jobs: What Does it Mean for the Federal Reserve?</title><link href="/news/2023/10/06/US-Jobs-Boost/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="U.S. Economy Surprises with 336,000 New Jobs: What Does it Mean for the Federal Reserve?" /><published>2023-10-06T10:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-06T10:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/06/US-Jobs-Boost</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/06/US-Jobs-Boost/">&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected twist, U.S. employers have outdone economic forecasts by adding a whopping 336,000 jobs in September. This significant surge, reported by the Department of Labor, might be signaling the Federal Reserve to reconsider its interest rates in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, economic analysts had projected the creation of around 160,000 jobs for September. The actual numbers have surpassed even the most optimistic estimates by a significant margin. Concurrently, the unemployment rate has stabilized at 3.8%, contrary to the anticipated drop to 3.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures follow previously adjusted numbers for July and August. Initially, July reported 157,000 new jobs which later saw a revision to 236,000. August’s employment was also adjusted from 187,000 to 227,000. Collectively, these adjustments signify an increase of 119,000 jobs beyond the initially reported figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next move is rife. With the robust job growth, there’s growing pressure on the Federal Reserve to reconsider hiking interest rates in their upcoming meeting at the end of October. Notably, during their last assembly in September, the decision was to maintain current rates, aiming to observe the effects of previous rate increases on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent data from the Labor Department sheds light on the vitality of the job market. A staggering 9.61 million job listings were recorded on the last day of August, eclipsing earlier estimates. This could imply that many businesses, witnessing a robust job market, no longer anticipate a looming recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the labor market hasn’t been without its challenges. Demonstrations of this include the recent strikes led by labor unions, such as the notable strike by the United Auto Workers members against General Motors in Lansing, Michigan. Despite these disruptions, employers remain resilient. An indicator of this is the jobless claims totaling 207,000 during the seven-day period ending September 27. Historically, this is considerably low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the private sector’s contribution to this growth can’t be overlooked. They’ve accounted for 263,000 of the new jobs, overshadowing ADP’s reported 89,000. It’s essential to note that ADP, a prominent payroll processor, has stated that its figures are now independent of the Labor Department’s data and should be viewed as a distinct economic insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the U.S. economy’s robust job growth in September provides a beacon of hope and optimism. It’s a testament to the resilience of businesses and workers alike. As we await the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming decisions, one thing is clear: the U.S. labor market is thriving against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In an unexpected twist, U.S. employers have outdone economic forecasts by adding a whopping 336,000 jobs in September.

&lt;p&gt;Adam Fleischman, known as the Iron Chef winner and the mastermind behind the famed Umami Burger, found himself in a controversial situation when he was accused of squatting in an older woman’s Hollywood residence. The accuser, identified only as Claudia, alleges that Fleischman lived in her home without paying rent since May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash Shelton, a handyman with a unique specialty of evicting squatters, filmed his confrontation with Fleischman and shared it online, creating a whirlwind of media attention. Fleischman, in his defense, claims that his intentions were to be a lawful tenant. He states that he was never provided with a lease or keys, hinting at landlord negligence. “She did not ask for rent for the first 2-3 months. I thought she had some sort of arrangement or credit,” Fleischman mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claudia’s frustration was evident, especially when she described her inability to legally evict Fleischman without court intervention. “The system is broken,” she declared, adding that even after persistent requests for Fleischman to vacate, law enforcement stated they couldn’t assist due to the situation being a civil matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial connection between Fleischman and Claudia began when she posted an ad on Craigslist, seeking individuals to help with the rent. The two conceived an idea of hosting dinner parties at the home to generate income, a seemingly perfect collaboration given Fleischman’s culinary background. Yet, things went south. Claudia accuses the chef of not compensating her for an event and even alleges misuse of her credit card for event-related purchases, which Fleischman vehemently denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelton, who has previously evicted squatters from his mother’s home, offered his assistance to Claudia pro bono. He voiced his disbelief at the entire situation, struggling to comprehend how Fleischman could reside in the home without any sense of obligation towards Claudia. Videos captured by Shelton display LAPD officers permitting him to install cameras in the residence for monitoring, indicating the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst this chaotic backdrop, Shelton is utilizing the heightened attention to advocate for a change in squatting laws. He has initiated a GoFundMe campaign to support his efforts in aiding others facing squatter troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Fleischman, his recent ventures have been rocky. He launched a restaurant named Slow Burn in 2022, but it mysteriously shuttered shortly after its opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story serves as a stark reminder that even in the glittering world of Hollywood, disputes over home and hearth can take unexpected turns.

&lt;p&gt;Steele shed light on an episode in March 2021 when she interviewed the President. She conveyed her concerns regarding what she believed was Biden’s cognitive decline, particularly when he “trailed off” during a chat before their scheduled recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was trying just to fill time. And he said, ‘You know, I used to play football’… And so he started to tell football stories of his greatness… He said ‘I was good’ and then he went silent and he goes ‘Uhh… never mind,’” recalled Steele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher, known for his candid observations, drew comparisons to a scene from a ‘Naked Gun’ movie. Steele’s poignant description left many wondering about the President’s fitness for office, given the high demands of the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Steele’s revelations didn’t stop there. She went on to discuss her unexpected encounter with former President Trump at his Bedminster golf course. Their connection revolved around their shared love for football and Trump’s endeavors to rejuvenate sports post-COVID. Steele also confessed to being “thoroughly entertained” by Trump’s audacious tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher’s astonishment was palpable as he found out that Steele didn’t cast her vote for either Biden or Barack Obama in previous elections. Steele was quick to clarify, “I don’t love [Trump]. There’s a big difference in voting for someone and loving them.” She emphasized the importance of differentiating between politicians’ personal attributes and their policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recent revelation from Steele, combined with the ever-politicized climate, further underscores the need for transparency and candid discussions about our nation’s leaders.

This Wednesday, Trump’s adept legal team persistently sought clarity from accountant Donald Bender, whose preparation of the financial statements is currently in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, propelled by New York Attorney General Letitia James, accuses Trump and his renowned business of overstating his wealth in financial documents provided to financial institutions. Many observers see this as a politically charged move against the former president. In a striking revelation, Bender admitted that the Trump Organization hadn’t always been provided with comprehensive guidelines for these documents. Rather than accepting accountability for possible oversights, Bender tried to shift the blame elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Jesus M. Suarez brilliantly highlighted a pivotal moment, referencing a pretrial video testimony. Bender, caught off guard, expressed doubt about having consulted with any specialists when forming Trump’s financial statements. The defense rightly pinpointed an overlooked detail about the size of Trump’s Trump Tower apartment, suggesting that the burden of this miscalculation should not fall squarely on the Trump Organization. In response, Bender appeared to backtrack, suggesting the oversight was a collective error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trial proceedings intensified, Judge Arthur Engoron seemed impatient with Trump’s defense team’s thorough line of questioning. In a surprising move, he attempted to expedite the questioning, which the defense rightfully argued would restrict their ability to adequately represent the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial, perceived by many as an extension of political maneuvering, could have broad implications. Although Judge Engoron hastily ruled that Trump allegedly inflated the value of certain assets, Trump’s lawyers have launched an appeal. Many believe this ruling, which could jeopardize Trump’s ownership of properties like the Trump Tower, seems heavy-handed given the trial’s politically charged backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making headlines is Trump’s unwavering commitment to clearing his name. Despite being in the midst of his 2024 presidential campaign trail, Trump chose to be present at the trial. Outside the court, he voiced his concerns about the proceedings, describing James as “incompetent” and emphasizing his desire to shed light on the perceived injustices of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James was quick to counter, but her remarks came across as more of a rehearsed political statement than a genuine retort. She labeled Trump’s involvement as a “political stunt,” a claim that seems ironic given the nature of the lawsuit itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s candid remarks outside the court, especially directed towards Engoron’s team, eventually led to a restraining order on his comments. In line with his commitment to transparency and fairness, Trump promptly complied by removing a post that was deemed offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the trial set to decide upon potential penalties of up to $250 million and possible restrictions on Trump’s business operations in New York, many see it as an attempt to sideline the former president.

&lt;p&gt;Jesperson’s reign of terror spanned the 1990s. His moniker, “Happy Face,” was derived from the eerie smiley-face signature he left on letters sent to media outlets, where he chillingly detailed his crimes. These heinous acts were committed across various states, while he worked as a long-haul trucker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent, unexpected interview with Okaloosa authorities at the Oregon State Penitentiary, Jesperson made a shocking confession. He revealed details about meeting Kjellenberg at a truck rest stop, stating she was on her way to Lake Tahoe and seeking a ride. The two journeyed together to Cairo, Georgia, even sharing a meal. Their trip took a dark turn on the return leg to Florida. After an altercation in the driver’s lounge of his truck, Jesperson brutally ended Kjellenberg’s life, then dumped her body along the interstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesperson had hinted at this killing previously. After his arrest in 1996, he spoke of murdering a woman named either “Susan” or “Suzette” in August 1994. It wasn’t until the Okaloosa Sheriff’s Office (OSO) made a formal announcement that Kjellenberg’s identity came to light, three decades post the tragic discovery of her remains by an inmate worker crew off Interstate 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSO’s relentless pursuit of the truth saw them partnering with Othram, a leading forensic genetic genealogy lab, in 2022. This collaboration aimed to identify the remains found 28 years earlier. After providing samples to Othram in 2023, a genealogical profile, funded by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), delivered the leads that eventually named Suzanne Kjellenberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District 1 Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deanna Oleske mentioned the entire process took a mere six weeks. On the back of this breakthrough, authorities officially charged Jesperson with Kjellenberg’s murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Eric Aden expressed his gratitude for the perseverance shown over the years. He stated, “Thanks to the tireless efforts of so many over so long, the remains of Suzanne Kjellenberg, the final unidentified victim of Jesperson’s cross-country murder sprees, can finally leave the Medical Examiner’s Office, and return home.”&lt;/p&gt;

OSO’s relentless pursuit of the truth saw them partnering with Othram, a leading forensic genetic genealogy lab, in 2022. This collaboration aimed to identify the remains found 28 years earlier. After providing samples to Othram in 2023, a genealogical profile, funded by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), delivered the leads that eventually named Suzanne Kjellenberg. District 1 Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deanna Oleske mentioned the entire process took a mere six weeks. On the back of this breakthrough, authorities officially charged Jesperson with Kjellenberg’s murder. Sheriff Eric Aden expressed his gratitude for the perseverance shown over the years. He stated, “Thanks to the tireless efforts of so many over so long, the remains of Suzanne Kjellenberg, the final unidentified victim of Jesperson’s cross-country murder sprees, can finally leave the Medical Examiner’s Office, and return home.” The harrowing tale of Keith Jesperson and his victims serves as a haunting reminder of the secrets that sometimes lay hidden for decades, only to resurface when least expected.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden’s Nomination Sparks Controversy: Ties to Hunter’s Former Colleague</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/05/Biden-Special-Counsel-Nomination/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden’s Nomination Sparks Controversy: Ties to Hunter’s Former Colleague" /><published>2023-10-05T13:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-05T13:42:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/05/Biden-Special-Counsel-Nomination</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/05/Biden-Special-Counsel-Nomination/">&lt;p&gt;In what some might call a controversial move, President Joe Biden has proposed Hampton Dellinger, a past colleague of Hunter Biden, for the prestigious role of White House Special Counsel. This nomination comes at a critical juncture, as the Office of the Special Counsel currently oversees federal whistleblower protections and the investigation of executive branch corruption, including the Justice Department’s inquiries into Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dellinger shares more than just a professional connection with Hunter; both are Yale Law School graduates. They worked together at Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm where Hunter Biden notably sought representation for Burisma Holdings. For those unaware, Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, made payments of $83,000 per month to Hunter for his position on their board. There are allegations, backed by an FBI FD-1023 file and seconded by IRS whistleblower Joseph Ziegler, of bribes amounting to $5 million each for both Joe and Hunter Biden from a Burisma executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains a matter of speculation whether Dellinger provided legal services for Burisma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nomination are weighty. If Dellinger secures the role, he would have jurisdiction over the investigations concerning any retaliation claims by the DOJ against two IRS whistleblowers who argued that the DOJ’s inquiry into Hunter Biden was politically influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments had seen Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) calling on the current Special Counsel, Henry Kerner, to look into alleged meddling. They voiced concerns, stating, “Two IRS whistleblowers and their team faced removal from the Hunter Biden case, seemingly as a retaliation for their legal interactions with Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the fire, Hunter Biden’s legal representative, Abbe Lowell, targeted these IRS whistleblowers a few months ago, hinting at possible legal action by the DOJ for releasing Hunter Biden’s tax details to the House Ways and Means Committee. This incident led to Hunter suing the IRS in September, claiming improper information disclosure by these whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where whistleblowing is deemed essential, IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel emphasizes that IRS employees should be the first to highlight alarming issues. He envisions a proactive environment, encouraging a “see something, say something” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a candid interaction at the New York State courthouse, Trump quashed speculation surrounding his potential candidacy for the House’s top spot. “While numerous people have approached me regarding the speakership role,” Trump stated, “My overarching focus remains on the presidency and reigniting our national motto, ‘Make America Great Again’. Our nation is facing setbacks, and that is where my attention is drawn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This public proclamation by Trump arises as the House of Representatives grapples with a significant shift in leadership dynamics. The recent ousting of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) by a decisive vote of 216-210 has left the coveted position up for grabs. Notably, the vote saw eight of McCarthy’s fellow Republicans joining the Democrat caucus in the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the position now vacant, some GOP frontrunners, such as Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), the majority whip, are all seen as contenders. While Trump acknowledges the potential and capabilities of these “great people” within the Republican Party, he remains committed to his presidential aspirations. “When it comes to the race for president, my current lead by 50 points reflects my focus and where I believe my efforts are best suited,” Trump emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent tumult in the House reached fever pitch when McCarthy’s apparent belief in receiving support from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was left unmet. Addressing this political maneuvering, McCarthy expressed during a press conference, “I perceive today’s outcome as a strategic decision by the Democrats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement prior to the vote, Pelosi underscored the established process, saying, “In this Congress, it is the onus of House Republicans to nominate and elect the Speaker on the Floor. At this juncture, I see no grounds to deviate from this longstanding tradition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political landscape continues its unpredictable trajectory, Trump’s renewed commitment to the presidential race undoubtedly sets the stage for what promises to be an intense political season ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Amidst the swirl of political rumors, former President Donald Trump makes his stance clear, sidelining the possibility of eyeing the Speaker of the House role, and reaffirming his commitment to once again securing the presidency.

Jenkins is implicated in the alleged shooting of a Cleveland County deputy and the inadvertent killing of a motorist due to a stray bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident transpired during what started as a regular traffic stop, but quickly escalated into a chase. This altercation took place near the 60-mile marker of Interstate 35. The injured deputy, after being shot, was promptly airlifted to a nearby medical facility where he has been reported to be in stable condition. However, the incident took a tragic turn when an uninvolved motorist was fatally hit by a stray bullet, believed to be from the suspect’s firearm as he was shooting at the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kameron Jenkins, currently the focal point of this intensive manhunt, has been described by the OSBI as a Black man standing at approximately 6-foot-4, weighing around 170–200 pounds. Distinctive features include his black dreadlocks and brown eyes. The last outfit he was seen wearing was a white shirt. The severity of the situation is underlined by warnings from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol, emphasizing that Jenkins is not only armed and dangerous but may also be carrying a semi-automatic weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local news outlet FOX 25 in Oklahoma City shed further light, mentioning that Jenkins might be in a white trailer towed by a black pickup truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving deeper into Jenkins’ past, his criminal record presents several red flags. In 2015, he faced a maiming charge which was eventually dismissed. By 2017, he pleaded guilty to assault and battery charges. Not stopping there, Jenkins also entered guilty pleas for DUI and marijuana-related charges in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies are urging citizens to exercise extreme caution. The prevailing advice for anyone who spots Jenkins or has information about his whereabouts is to promptly call 911. Engaging with Jenkins or attempting to approach him can be perilous due to his considered armed and potentially volatile status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event has sent shockwaves across Oklahoma, with residents anxiously hoping for a swift resolution and the prevention of further incidents. With the collective efforts of the OSBI and other enforcement agencies, the goal remains to bring Jenkins into custody and ensure the safety of the public.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A grave turn of events has gripped Oklahoma as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations (OSBI), supported by multiple law enforcement agencies, spearheads a manhunt for Kameron Jenkins, a 25-year-old suspect.

The move aims to prevent any significant civil disturbances similar to those witnessed on January 6, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, based on inputs from over a dozen current and former government officials specializing in terrorism, paints a picture of the ongoing domestic-security landscape. Furthermore, it evaluates the Biden administration’s approach to the issue they label as “domestic terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One anonymous FBI official highlighted the Bureau’s delicate task of ensuring safety without infringing upon Americans’ constitutional rights. The FBI’s concentrated focus on Trump supporters could inadvertently spark anti-government activities that the Bureau strives to mitigate. “It has to tread very carefully,” the official emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s vocal criticism of Trump supporters, coupled with his administration’s portrayal of them as threats to democracy, intensifies the ongoing debate. Such narratives could push certain groups to adopt more extreme measures, especially if they feel marginalized by the system. It’s a delicate balance, with heightened stakes on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsweek’s access to classified FBI and Department of Homeland Security data led them to question if “terrorism” is the most accurate term to describe these domestic issues. Equally, whether strategies developed in response to global extremist groups like al-Qaida are appropriate for addressing domestic concerns remains debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable revelation from the investigation was the FBI’s introduction of a new subcategory in 2022: “AGAAVE-Other.” This classification encompasses “domestic violent extremists” driven by anti-government or anti-authority motivations. It specifically covers those inclined to target individuals based on their perceived political affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not explicitly stated, insiders have confirmed that the “AGAAVE-Other” title relates to politically-motivated violence stemming from Trump supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the FBI has been clear in its stance. They stated that the AGAAVE threat umbrella covers a range of violent extremists, targeting both Republican and Democratic affiliations. This point reaffirms that the investigations are not solely focused on Trump supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, another senior intelligence official candidly shared with Newsweek that Trump’s supporters represent a significant domestic threat. The FBI’s primary role is to address this potential for violence, they asserted. But the broader question of whether Trump and his followers pose a threat to the nation’s fabric is a complex one. The responsibility of answering that, they believe, falls on the entire country, not just the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">A recent Newsweek investigation has revealed that the FBI is discreetly monitoring supporters of former President Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 elections.
