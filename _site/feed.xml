A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/16/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-16T14:21:35-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-16T14:21:35-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/16/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/16/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Mike Pence’s Campaign Faces $620K Debt in Q3</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/16/Pence-Campaign-Debt/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mike Pence’s Campaign Faces $620K Debt in Q3" /><published>2023-10-16T14:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-16T14:14:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/16/Pence-Campaign-Debt</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/16/Pence-Campaign-Debt/">&lt;p&gt;As the political arena heats up for the upcoming elections, former Vice President Mike Pence finds his campaign in a tight financial spot. The latest figures show a debt of $620,000 for Pence’s campaign during the third quarter fundraising period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the campaign has reported raising a notable $3.3 million, with Pence personally contributing $150,000 from his funds, they are left with only $1.2 million in cash on hand. But there’s a catch: at least $200,000 of this amount is set aside exclusively for the general election, as it originates from donors who’ve maxed out their contributions. This means that a significant chunk of Pence’s available funds cannot be utilized during the crucial primary season, potentially hampering the campaign’s momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Pence’s figures, other GOP candidates are making significant headway in their fundraising efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikki Haley’s Surge&lt;/strong&gt;: Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley reported raising a whopping $11 million in the third quarter, with a solid $9.1 million readily available for the primary phase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeSantis’ Strong Start&lt;/strong&gt;: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis showcased his campaign prowess by announcing a $15 million third-quarter fundraising achievement. Starting October with a comfortable $13.5 million, DeSantis has a significant $5 million reserved for primary season endeavors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Towering Finances&lt;/strong&gt;: Former President Donald Trump’s campaign continues its financial dominance, boasting approximately $36 million for primary expenditures after an impressive $45.5 million raise in the third quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these numbers shine a light on each campaign’s financial standing, it’s crucial to remember that these figures stem from campaign announcements. They will only be verified once the official reports are submitted to the Federal Election Commission by the end of Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence’s current financial position underscores the challenges his campaign faces, especially when juxtaposed against his GOP peers. As the political season progresses, fundraising will undeniably play a pivotal role in shaping campaign strategies and influencing voter outreach efforts.

This decisive action comes as a part of his executive order from Oct. 12, with the primary goal of aiding the return of an estimated 20,000 U.S. citizens stranded in Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeSantis shared his sentiments and the success of the mission on social media, stating, “We are here at Tampa airport, we are having our first flight of people being rescued from Israel. Over 260 people that wanted to get back to the United States and couldn’t do it because there was a devoid in leadership, so we stepped up and led. We are happy to be able to deliver that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Channel 8, a local Tampa television station, highlighted the details of the evacuation flight, noting that the plane had made its journey through Portugal before arriving in Tampa at 7:45 p.m. Additionally, a smaller group of seven evacuees was transported to Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the escalating situation in Israel, DeSantis’s order last week mobilized the Florida Division of Emergency Management to ensure a safe return of citizens facing difficulties leaving Israel. The order reads, “There are more than 20,000 Americans, including Floridians in Israel who wish to return home but are unable to do so.” This move aimed to address the perceived lack of prompt action from the Biden administration to rescue American citizens from the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day as DeSantis’s order, the White House shared its plan for evacuating Americans. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, stated that the administration intends to organize a minimum of four flights daily to ensure the safe exit of U.S. citizens. A report from Oct. 12 revealed the tragic toll the conflict has taken on American lives, confirming 27 Americans lost amidst the larger count of over 2,600 casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tensions intensifying and the shadow of Hamas looming over Americans in the region, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent visit to Israel signifies the pressing need for collaborative international efforts. Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Blinken discussed the U.S.’s commitment to supporting nations willing to accept refugees fleeing from Gaza, including Americans, especially as Israel contemplates a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation in Israel remains volatile, but thanks to coordinated efforts, hundreds of Americans are now safely back on home turf.

The Dallas Police Department has since identified and arrested 22-year-old Cameron Turner as the primary suspect responsible for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witnesses recall the traumatic experience, with one stating that she heard four gunshots, followed by a brief pause, and then another shot rang out. This violent episode occurred near the bustling food court around 8 p.m., causing immediate panic among the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though three people—a woman and two men—fell victim to the gunfire, they are fortunately expected to make a full recovery. Notably, at least one of the injured was identified as an innocent bystander, highlighting the unpredictability and potential dangers of such situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turner didn’t manage to elude capture for long. After fleeing the scene post-shooting, he was swiftly apprehended by law enforcement, with a firearm also being recovered. The consequences of his actions are now catching up, as he faces charges of aggravated assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dallas Councilman Adam Bazaldua, the shooting wasn’t a random act of violence. He mentioned that it seemed to have stemmed from a disagreement between two individuals acquainted with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident has raised eyebrows, especially considering the tight security measures in place at the Texas State Fair. Karissa Condoianis, representing the State Fair’s public relations, stated, “We don’t allow weapons in the State Fair of Texas.” Despite this policy, licensed gun owners can carry concealed weapons, a decision made to respect Texans’ rights while attempting to maintain a safe environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shooting has triggered discussions about the effectiveness of the fairground’s security systems. Notably, an open-gate weapons detection system had been newly introduced this year, designed to detect weapons on visitors and prompt security for further inspection. However, the system’s failure to identify Turner’s weapon before the incident has raised valid concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these events and with a week left for the fair’s operation, the authorities plan to ramp up security measures, ensuring attendees’ safety and aiming to prevent any future incidents of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a shocking turn of events, the Texas State Fair became the scene of a tragic incident when gunfire erupted on Saturday night, leading to the injury of three individuals.

Jim Jordan of Ohio finds himself in a fierce battle for the coveted speakership role. With the Tuesday floor vote rapidly approaching, Jordan is reportedly still 15 to 19 votes shy of the necessary 217 to claim victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highly influential figure within the Republican Party, Jordan’s relentless efforts during the weekend did little to bridge the vote gap. Insiders even suggest the deficit might be wider, pointing to a secret ballot where Jordan trailed the lesser-known Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., by 55 votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the stakes increase, Jordan’s team seeks to leverage the transparency of a public floor vote, believing that Republicans would face significant pressure to rally behind one of their own. Bolstering this strategy, former President Donald Trump has allegedly made discreet overtures to undecided members, advocating for a Jordan speakership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all Republicans share this sentiment. An evident anti-Jordan faction within the party wishes for a different leadership direction, with a member commenting they “want anybody but Jim.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the GOP is engrossed in its internal tussle, Democrats are crafting strategies of their own. A letter penned by four centrist Democrats from the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus proposed backing Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as a temporary speaker. This arrangement would be revisited every 15 days, allowing for pivotal legislative actions like aid to Israel and federal government funding to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though such “coalition speakers” have been seen in state legislatures, including Connecticut, California, and New Jersey, many Republicans are quick to dismiss the proposal. An anonymous GOP lawmaker expressed concerns over ceding power to Democrats, anticipating adverse ramifications in the upcoming 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Jordan’s supporters remain optimistic. Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., praised Jordan’s leadership qualities, stating, “The real measure of a leader is how they increase their impact and have a sense of purpose and mission.” Furthermore, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., believes there’s a pathway for Jordan, although it might be different from traditional routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political arena waits with bated breath as Jordan’s decisive week unfolds. The lingering question is whether Jordan can rally enough support or if he’ll have to step aside, opening the floor for new contenders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a dramatic turn of events, Rep.

Best known for her iconic role as “Chrissy Snow” on “Three’s Company,” Suzanne passed away at the age of 76 after a long battle with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Northern California, Suzanne’s big break came in 1977 when she landed the role of the bubbly blonde roommate, Chrissy, in the hit sitcom “Three’s Company.” With her natural comedic timing and undeniable on-screen charisma, Somers quickly became a household name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Suzanne wasn’t just confined to the realms of television. Her business acumen led her to become the spokesperson, and eventually the owner, of the popular fitness product, ThighMaster. This at-home exercise device designed to tone legs reportedly netted her a staggering $300 million. Somers once quipped she stopped counting sales “after 10 million.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ventured further into the world of entrepreneurship, penning 27 books, with 14 hitting the New York Times bestseller list. Suzanne’s name adorned products ranging from jewelry to protein formula. Last year, she mentioned, “I have over a thousand products.” Her dedication to work was evident, even joking that her biggest complaint was that she “worked too much.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from her business endeavors, Suzanne’s resilience in her health journey was nothing short of inspiring. Diagnosed with skin cancer in her 30s and breast cancer in her 50s, she faced each challenge head-on, often combining alternative and conventional treatments. “Every time that little f—– pops up, I continue to bat it back,” she bravely stated in July, when she revealed her breast cancer’s recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout her journey, her husband, Alan Hamel, was her unwavering pillar of support. Married since 1977, their love story was one that many admired. “I can’t even explain how much he has done for me. If it’s even possible, we are even closer than ever,” Suzanne once shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzanne’s life wasn’t without its challenges, but her ability to find joy in every moment set her apart. During the pandemic, she adapted to the digital age, engaging with fans through Facebook Live and Instagram shows. Always with a drink in hand and her husband behind the camera, Suzanne cherished the freedom the internet gave her compared to mainstream television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A health-conscious individual, Suzanne was committed to an organic lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of toxin-free products in her household, especially after her cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fans, friends, and family bid adieu to this multifaceted icon, they celebrate her extraordinary life, legacy, and the profound impact she had on countless lives. Whether through her infectious laugh on “Three’s Company,” her best-selling books, or her enduring love story with Alan, Suzanne Somers will always be remembered as a beacon of strength, talent, and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Hollywood mourns the loss of a star, Suzanne Somers, who left an indelible mark both on and off-screen. Best known for her iconic role as “Chrissy Snow” on “Three’s Company,” Suzanne passed away at the age of 76 after a long battle with breast cancer. Born in Northern California, Suzanne’s big break came in 1977 when she landed the role of the bubbly blonde roommate, Chrissy, in the hit sitcom “Three’s Company.” With her natural comedic timing and undeniable on-screen charisma, Somers quickly became a household name. But Suzanne wasn’t just confined to the realms of television. Her business acumen led her to become the spokesperson, and eventually the owner, of the popular fitness product, ThighMaster. This at-home exercise device designed to tone legs reportedly netted her a staggering $300 million. Somers once quipped she stopped counting sales “after 10 million.” She ventured further into the world of entrepreneurship, penning 27 books, with 14 hitting the New York Times bestseller list. Suzanne’s name adorned products ranging from jewelry to protein formula. Last year, she mentioned, “I have over a thousand products.” Her dedication to work was evident, even joking that her biggest complaint was that she “worked too much.” Apart from her business endeavors, Suzanne’s resilience in her health journey was nothing short of inspiring. Diagnosed with skin cancer in her 30s and breast cancer in her 50s, she faced each challenge head-on, often combining alternative and conventional treatments. “Every time that little f—– pops up, I continue to bat it back,” she bravely stated in July, when she revealed her breast cancer’s recurrence.

Additionally, Trump has cautioned American auto workers about a looming job crisis, predicting their roles will become redundant in just two years if the current policies continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breitbart News has reported on the escalating situation where approximately 34,000 auto workers from companies like General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis are striking across the United States. These workers are striving to negotiate new contracts that would guarantee better wages amidst soaring inflation and job security assurances against the backdrop of Biden’s EV mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a video message targeting the United Auto Workers (UAW), Trump expressed his intent to abolish Biden’s EV mandates, which he believes would endanger their jobs in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re an auto worker, be it in UAW or any other state, the future seems bleak. With the current trajectory, many of you might not have jobs in two years. I intend to rejuvenate the auto industry in our country, much like the golden days,” Trump emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former President further advised union leaders to reconsider their political affiliations, warning that siding with the Democrats might result in the downfall of the auto industry. He added, “No matter your hourly wage, the reality is, without a job, it doesn’t matter. I aim to restore the prosperity of the auto industry and the workers behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car prices have surged, which Trump attributes to Biden’s policies. He stated, “Since my term ended, car prices have skyrocketed by nearly 30%, with the average new car price reaching a staggering $50,000. This isn’t just an attack on the automobile industry; it’s an attack on the American dream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump criticized Biden’s EV mandates for pushing car companies to elevate prices and eventually phasing out their more affordable gas-powered models. As a result, consumers are being nudged towards the pricier electric models. If companies resist this change, they could face hefty fines amounting to hundreds of millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in the auto industry view Biden’s EV mandates as a potential cost-saving strategy, which could indirectly boost executive salaries. Furthermore, thanks to Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), auto executives are on track to benefit from billions in tax credits, further promoting EV production and sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s strong stance on this matter highlights the ongoing debate about the trajectory of the American auto industry and the potential ramifications for workers and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former U.S. President Donald Trump, now leading in the Republican presidential primary, has promised to overturn President Joe Biden’s Electric Vehicle (EV) mandates.

&lt;p&gt;Grylls shared his profound moment with fans, expressing his elation at experiencing a sacrament in the very waters where, according to Christian beliefs, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. “It had always been a dream of mine to get in the water that Jesus was baptized in by my hero John the Baptist,” Grylls penned on his social media. Alongside his heartfelt message, he posted a photo capturing the poignant moment of his baptism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Grylls, over the years, has never shied away from discussing his faith. In 2022, during an engaging chat with Steven Bartlett on ‘The Diary of a CEO’, Grylls shed light on how his faith anchors him. He reminisced about his childhood, saying, “As a kid, I had a really natural faith, always felt there was something greater around.” However, he expressed regret over how modern perceptions of Christianity have been “tarnished”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further delved into his beliefs, emphasizing the power of faith as a guiding light. “Faith is in your heart, knowing that you are not alone. There’s something bigger than us out there,” he elaborated, highlighting the importance of love, trust, and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this sentiment, in a conversation with the Christian Post, Grylls shared his concerns about the contemporary practices of many churches. Expressing his thoughts, he mentioned, “I think Jesus would really struggle with 99% of churches nowadays.” Grylls emphasized that the crux of faith lies in love, community, honesty, and staying close to one’s beliefs rather than being embroiled in the theatrics of religious practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Ireland, the TV star proudly associates with the UK’s Anglican Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grylls’ baptism in the Jordan River and his candid discussions about faith reflect the TV star’s deep-rooted beliefs.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has confirmed that a fourth Iranian, identified as a “special interest alien”, was detained this month in Eagle Pass, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “special interest alien” is used for individuals from countries believed by the US government to either protect or promote terrorism, or those that might pose a potential national security risk to the United States. Such detainees undergo added vetting and questioning following their apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBP sources informed Fox News that the recently apprehended Iranian man, in his 40s, was taken into custody after crossing the border around 3 a.m. in Eagle Pass. Notably, he voluntarily surrendered to the border agents after the illegal crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, Eagle Pass has seen a surge in the apprehension of “special interest aliens”. In a separate incident, two Lebanese nationals were detained. Given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel and its association with Hezbollah, a group funded by Iran and labeled a terror organization by the State Department, these apprehensions are particularly alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, CBP officials have reported the detention of 19 Iranians and 17 Syrians in a span of a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These apprehensions coincide with growing security concerns, especially in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7th, which resulted in the death of 1,300 Israelis and left thousands injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security Council’s spokesman, John Kirby, stated last week that while Iran shows “broad complicity” due to its backing of Hamas, there is no evidence to suggest Iran’s involvement in planning or executing the recent Hamas attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a threat assessment released by the Department of Homeland Security last month emphasized the potential security threats. The document noted an uptick in agents encountering individuals on the watch list and highlighted concerns that “terrorists and criminal actors may exploit the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to enter the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consistent rise in apprehensions at the southern border underscores the growing challenges faced by CBP agents. With global tensions on the rise, the focus on securing borders and ensuring the safety of citizens becomes paramount.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Recent apprehensions at the US southern border have heightened concerns over national security.
