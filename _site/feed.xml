A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Battle Lines Drawn - Trump Urges Suing over Pennsylvania’s Auto Voter Registration!</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/25/Automatic-Voter-Registration-Pennsylvania/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Battle Lines Drawn - Trump Urges Suing over Pennsylvania’s Auto Voter Registration!" /><published>2023-09-25T12:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-25T12:30:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/25/Automatic-Voter-Registration-Pennsylvania</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/25/Automatic-Voter-Registration-Pennsylvania/">&lt;p&gt;In the latest political drama to unfold, Former President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to take legal action against Pennsylvania’s move towards automatic voter registration, initiated by Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pennsylvania-joins-the-fray&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania Joins the Fray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Shapiro’s attempt to position Pennsylvania among states with automatic voter registration has sparked considerable controversy. He asserts he can implement this without new legislation, claiming it is within the state’s current legal framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-strong-opposition&quot;&gt;Trump’s Strong Opposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump, never one to shy away from vocalizing his opposition, took to Truth Social, expressing his vehement disagreement with the move. “Start suing now, &amp;amp; get the right lawyers this time!” he wrote, regarding what he perceives as a disastrous and unconstitutional act that threatens the election of Republicans, including himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump perceives this shift as a way for “Marxists, &amp;amp; Fascists,” to cheat on elections, and potentially detrimental to the Republican hold in key battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-political-tug-of-war&quot;&gt;The Political Tug of War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three states, including Washington, D.C., already have automatic voter registration. This new methodology being adopted by predominantly blue states or key battleground regions seems to be a new strategy by Democrats, causing a shift in traditional voter registration norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, Shapiro’s administration is making voter registration more accessible, tying it to obtaining or renewing a driver’s license. This move means individuals are presented with the opportunity to register to vote more directly when they interact with driver’s license centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-crux-of-the-matter&quot;&gt;The Crux of the Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States have been obligated to offer voter registration at driver’s license centers since 1993 when the National Voter Registration Act was passed. The bone of contention, therefore, isn’t about offering registration but about the method of offering it. The contention arises from the transition to automatic prompts for voter registration, compared to the previous method where individuals were first asked if they wanted to register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-larger-picture&quot;&gt;The Larger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s call for legal action is similar to his 2020 opposition to mass mail-in ballots. He views this as another attempt by Democrats to alter election dynamics in their favor. The former President’s remarks aimed at his chief GOP primary rivals, including former Vice President Mike Pence and others, show the internal and external battle lines being drawn over this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;In a Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dramatic development in Pennsylvania is a sign of the continuous political tension and the constant struggle between Republicans and Democrats over voter registration and election fairness. It opens a new chapter in the ongoing debate over the integrity and accessibility of the voting process in America, with each side accusing the other of attempting to manipulate the system for their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In the latest political drama to unfold, Former President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to take legal action against Pennsylvania’s move towards automatic voter registration, initiated by Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro.

Both leaders, along with the Canadian parliament, gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a war veteran reportedly associated with a Nazi military division, following their addresses to the parliament in Ottawa on September 22, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-controversial-tribute&quot;&gt;A Controversial Tribute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veteran in question, Yaroslav Hunka, is hailed as a hero who fought for Ukrainian independence against the Russians during the Second World War. He is recognized for his continual support for the troops at the age of 98. However, his reported association with the “First Ukrainian Division in World War II,” also known as the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician), has turned the honorable acknowledgment into a subject of heated debate and scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsettling-associations&quot;&gt;Unsettling Associations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This division, formed by Nazi Germany in 1943, mainly composed of Ukrainian volunteers. It’s known to have connections with numerous massacres and atrocities during the war. The Associated Press, revealing Hunka’s association with this division, published a photo featuring both leaders standing and applauding him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canadian-stance-on-ukrainian-volunteers&quot;&gt;Canadian Stance on Ukrainian Volunteers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Canadian government, despite the revelations of such severe human rights violations by the Waffen-SS, decided in 1950 to allow Ukrainians who served in this division to enter the country from the UK. They stated, “These Ukrainians should be subject to special security screening, but should not be rejected on the grounds of their service in the German army.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wide-ranging-impact&quot;&gt;The Wide-Ranging Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reception and the celebration of individuals associated with such controversial entities raise questions about the moral and ethical values represented by international leaders. It also brings forward the nuanced and multifaceted history of war, where heroes for some might have a shaded past that tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This instance has stirred conversations on the importance of thoroughly understanding and analyzing the background of individuals before granting them public recognition, especially by people holding significant positions of power. Such acknowledgment without comprehensive insight can lead to misinterpretations and alter the perception of historical truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reactions-and-reflections&quot;&gt;Reactions and Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Katchanovski of the University of Ottawa has labeled this celebration as an “epic scandal” and finds the acceptance and celebration of Hunka “truly unbelievable,” raising concerns on whether the parliament and President Zelensky were aware of his service in the Waffen SS division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-undercurrents-of-history&quot;&gt;The Undercurrents of History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of remembering and understanding the nuances of history is crucial in today’s times, where the lines between right and wrong can often blur. Recognizing individuals with such dubious connections without probing into their past can lead to the dilution of the severe crimes committed during the wartime era.&lt;/p&gt;

The Democratic Senator from New Jersey made this declaration in what is to be his first public appearance since the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dramatic-setting&quot;&gt;A Dramatic Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menendez plans to make his startling announcement at a press conference in Hudson County, the very place where he embarked upon his political career as a young 20-year-old school board member, thus adding a symbolic undertone to his controversial decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Even television… I notice if they kind of watch too much TV, like they have an attitude shift,” Underwood shared on “Today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, facilitated by China, seems to have altered the U.S.’ stance towards the Kingdom. This change might have prompted a shift from President Biden’s initial reluctance to engage with Saudi Arabia to exploring common ground and collaborative prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;harmony-over-conflict&quot;&gt;Harmony Over Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meeting between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly focused on the possibility of peace with Saudi Arabia, sidelining previous contentious issues like the demand for a Palestinian state. This concentration on peace emphasizes the evolving priorities in Middle-Eastern politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assurances-and-risks&quot;&gt;Assurances and Risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. representatives affirm that the prospective enrichment facility in Saudi Arabia would adhere to non-proliferation norms. Israel seems willing to embrace the risks associated with a nuclear-armed Saudi Arabia, opting for peace and stabilized relations over long-standing apprehensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-picture&quot;&gt;The Big Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reported cooperation between the U.S., Israel, and Saudi Arabia on uranium enrichment underscores the shifting sands of Middle-Eastern geopolitics. The pursuit of peace through such high-stake deals reflects the intricate balance of power, diplomatic priorities, and the continuous endeavor to ensure stability in this tumultuous region.&lt;/p&gt;

This development comes amidst efforts to forge peace and enhance ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the predominant Sunni Arab state. Peace, Politics, and Uranium This collaborative venture, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, aims to establish a U.S.-controlled uranium-enrichment facility in Saudi Arabia, marking a pivotal point in the trilateral relations between the U.S., Israel, and Saudi Arabia. The intricate deal stands as a testament to the complex dynamics and the pursuit of peace in the volatile region.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-questionable-spotlight&quot;&gt;A Questionable Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fauci has remained a contentious figure, especially among Republicans, through both the Trump and Biden administrations, due to his aggressive advocacy for masks and COVID-19 vaccinations. The degree of emphasis Fauci places on these mandates raises questions regarding whether the focus is truly on public health or rather on maintaining a presence in the media spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-alleged-threat&quot;&gt;The Alleged Threat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeSantis’ comments—suggesting someone should “toss that little elf across the Potomac”—were showcased on MSNBC’s “Mehdi Hasan Show.” While it is clear that political rhetoric is intensifying, Fauci’s assertion that remarks like these are inciting actual harm seems to be an overstretch, possibly aimed at garnering sympathy and maintaining relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-overplayed-hand-of-safety-concerns&quot;&gt;The Overplayed Hand of Safety Concerns?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fauci claims to have been the target of hostile and potentially dangerous attention, necessitating a security detail, one can’t help but wonder if this is another overreaction, much like his stance on pandemic-related restrictions. His discordant statements with former President Trump seem to have amplified his desire to paint himself as a victim of far-right animosity, possibly to deflect from any substantial scrutiny of his policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-campaign-of-misrepresentation&quot;&gt;A Campaign of Misrepresentation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeSantis’ consistent emphasis on “freedom over Fauci-ism” has positioned Fauci as the face of alleged governmental overreach in public health. By portraying Fauci’s professional medical advice as an attack on personal freedoms, there seems to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the intent behind pandemic-related measures. Could this be Fauci leveraging the situation to perpetuate his relevance in the public and media sphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distraction-or-deliberation&quot;&gt;Distraction or Deliberation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the real issue at hand—the management of an ongoing pandemic—being sidelined by Fauci’s seemingly exaggerated claims and constant media presence? It appears that the discourse surrounding Fauci is less about public health and more about a continual self-preservation tactic, possibly at the cost of substantial discussions on public welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time when real and critical issues need to be addressed, it is paramount that the focus be on effective solutions and transparent dialogue, rather than on individuals seemingly using their platforms for personal agendas and theatrics. It remains crucial to discern the actual threats from the merely perceived, and to prioritize substantial action over needless drama.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Dr. Anthony Fauci, known for his high-profile role as a COVID-19 adviser in the White House, is back in the spotlight, claiming that remarks by GOP presidential candidate and Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, have forced him to maintain a security detail, suggesting a penchant for theatrical concerns.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;promises-of-peace-shadows-of-threats&quot;&gt;Promises of Peace, Shadows of Threats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han assured the assembly that China harbors no intentions of practicing “hegemony and expansion,” championing dialogue and peace instead. However, he contradicted his soothing words by issuing implicit threats to Taiwan, emphasizing the “firm resolve, strong will, and the power of the Chinese people” to achieve “complete reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taiwan-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Taiwan Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han’s insistence that Taiwan has been part of China since “ancient times” is a stark reminder of the tension brewing in the region. Despite Taiwan’s sovereign status, China has consistently claimed the island nation as its territory. The looming specter of China’s assertion and its refusal to acknowledge Taiwan’s independence continues to escalate tensions and raises eyebrows on the international front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-and-the-united-nations&quot;&gt;Taiwan and the United Nations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Taiwan, despite being a sovereign nation, has never been invited to the United Nations General Assembly or allowed membership in any United Nations agency. This exclusion results from relentless pressure from the Chinese government, emphasizing the strained relationship and the ongoing struggle for recognition and legitimacy that Taiwan faces on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discrepancy-in-human-rights-views&quot;&gt;Discrepancy in Human Rights Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han also dismissed the concept of universal human rights, proposing instead that “national conditions” dictate the value of a nation’s citizens’ humanity. This statement underlines China’s notorious human rights record and its continued dismissal of international human rights norms. Han’s argument that countries must forge their unique path in human rights, reflecting their national conditions, brings forth China’s stance on its governance model and its rejection of any international critique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-environmental-paradox&quot;&gt;The Environmental Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While China asserts its commitment to combating climate change, its claims contrast sharply with its actions. Despite promising to cease the construction of new coal-fired power projects abroad, China continues to be the largest builder of coal plants worldwide, raising questions about its genuine commitment to environmental conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-call-for-reflection&quot;&gt;A Call for Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han’s address to the United Nations brings to the forefront several concerns about China’s international stance, its commitment to peace, human rights, and environmental conservation. His words reflect a dichotomy between peaceful assurances and underlying threats, raising critical questions about China’s intentions and its role on the global stage.

Schumer’s prompt actions appear less about bipartisan solutions and more about provoking House Republicans into hastily responding with a stopgap proposal of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disregard-for-bipartisanship&quot;&gt;Disregard for Bipartisanship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schumer asserts that the progression on the FAA bill is a move to prevent a government shutdown and “avoid inflicting unnecessary pain on the American people.” However, this move seems to contrast with his supposed intent to work in a bipartisan manner. It raises concerns whether Democrats are genuinely interested in fostering cooperation or if they are instead leveraging the situation to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-of-schumers-push&quot;&gt;Implications of Schumer’s Push&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving forward without much consultation with the opposing side, Schumer’s advancement on the FAA legislation may indeed create unnecessary distress amongst the American populace by instigating an avoidable government standstill. With Congress already trailing in approving all twelve separate packages that comprise the larger bill, this push could intensify the existing bottlenecks and delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictable-standstill&quot;&gt;Predictable Standstill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ted Cruz predicts a very likely temporary government shutdown, accusing Democrats, including Schumer and President Biden, of exploiting such a situation for political gains. “They believe that in a shutdown, the press will eagerly blame it on Republicans,” Cruz stated, suggesting that the Democrats perceive a political advantage in forcing a shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-strategy-unveiled&quot;&gt;The Strategy Unveiled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real story here may be Schumer’s strategic maneuvering, coercing House Republicans to respond hastily to his advancements on stopgap legislation. It appears to be a politically calculated decision, wrapped in the disguise of bipartisanship, to propel Democrats’ agenda and potentially corner the Republicans, making them appear as the culprits if things head south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-genuine-concern-or-a-political-gambit&quot;&gt;A Genuine Concern or a Political Gambit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the deadline looms, the question remains whether Schumer and his Democratic colleagues are genuinely concerned about a shutdown and its repercussions on the American people, or if this is merely a political gambit to gain an upper hand against their Republican counterparts. The lack of mutual discourse and collaboration points towards the latter, painting a picture of a majority willing to disregard unity for political leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfolding situation places American citizens in a precarious position, making it imperative for lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to rise above partisan interests and work cooperatively to ensure the smooth functioning of the government, rather than exploiting bureaucratic processes for political gains.

These rising concerns prompt a closer examination of the perception and reality of diminishing freedoms in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overwhelming-concerns&quot;&gt;Overwhelming Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll, conducted by Rasmussen, included 998 likely voters and showed that 72% are worried about the country evolving into a police state. Nearly half of the respondents, 46%, declared that they are “very concerned.” In contrast, a mere 23% expressed no concerns, with less than 10% being “not at all concerned.” This stark divide illustrates a prevailing sense of unease and apprehension surrounding the government’s role in individual lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fbi-under-scrutiny&quot;&gt;FBI Under Scrutiny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents were also queried about their stance on the statement, “The FBI is a danger to the freedom and security of law-abiding Americans.” A surprising 50% agreed with this assertion, with a substantial number strongly concurring. This unveils a profound distrust and skepticism towards national law enforcement agencies, perceived as potential threats to personal freedom and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-divided-perception&quot;&gt;A Divided Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey further probed whether Democrats or Republicans pose a more significant risk to basic liberties in the United States. The responses mirrored the prevalent partisan divide, with 76% of Republicans and 65% of Democrats perceiving the opposing party as the greater threat to freedoms. These findings underscore the deeply ingrained political polarization and mutual suspicion that continue to characterize the American socio-political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-growing-unease&quot;&gt;A Growing Unease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing concerns about a potential ‘police state’ and the resulting loss of liberties emphasize a growing sense of unease among the American populace. This sentiment is fueled by perceived governmental overreach, intensifying surveillance, and the curbing of individual freedoms in the name of security. It calls for a renewed commitment to preserving democratic values, open dialogue, and checks and balances to ensure the protection of constitutional rights and liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
