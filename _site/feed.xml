A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Strikers in Limbo - Governor Newsom Vetoes Unemployment Bill</title><link href="/news/2023/10/03/Unemployment-Benefits-Veto/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Strikers in Limbo - Governor Newsom Vetoes Unemployment Bill" /><published>2023-10-03T08:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-03T08:14:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/03/Unemployment-Benefits-Veto</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/03/Unemployment-Benefits-Veto/">&lt;p&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom, drawing criticism and disappointment from labor unions and fellow Democrats, vetoed a pivotal bill aimed at extending unemployment benefits to striking workers, citing concerns over the state’s looming financial deficit in the unemployment trust fund, already nearing $20 billion in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strikers-left-out-in-the-cold&quot;&gt;Strikers Left Out in the Cold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veto comes as a blow to workers amidst several high-profile strikes across California. Notably, Hollywood writers recently concluded their nearly five-month walkout, while actors and Southern California hotel workers continue to strike. The proposed legislation, enjoying robust support from labor unions and Democratic legislators, sought to offer financial relief to workers on strike for at least two weeks, a provision currently available in only a few states like New York and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial-constraints---a-stumbling-block&quot;&gt;Financial Constraints - A Stumbling Block&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his veto message, Governor Newsom expressed concerns about the rising costs and the substantial debt incurred by the state’s unemployment trust fund. “Now is not the time to increase costs or incur this sizable debt,” he emphasized, reflecting the delicate balance between supporting worker rights and managing state finances prudently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-diverging-path-from-fellow-democrats&quot;&gt;A Diverging Path from Fellow Democrats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection of the bill spotlights a significant divergence between Governor Newsom and his fellow Democrats, revealing the challenges of aligning party unity with fiscal responsibility. The vetoed bill was passed by a Democratic-majority legislature in September, underscoring the internal disagreement within the party over extending benefits to striking workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consequences-and-repercussions&quot;&gt;Consequences and Repercussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the veto extends beyond political circles, directly affecting striking workers in various sectors. For many, the rejection of unemployment benefits adds another layer of hardship, as they navigate the tumultuous path of striking for better work conditions and rights without the safety net of unemployment checks. This intensifies the struggles of workers in industries already marked by disputes and walkouts, emphasizing the need for comprehensive solutions that address both worker rights and financial viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veto of the unemployment benefits bill by Governor Newsom underscores the intricate web of worker rights, party politics, and fiscal responsibility. While the decision aligns with financial prudence given the state’s substantial debt, it also reflects the ongoing struggle to reconcile worker support with economic constraints.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-swift-transition&quot;&gt;A Swift Transition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laphonza’s swift update occurred right after the announcement of her appointment to the U.S. Senate seat in California, previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. This change was noticed by reporters who observed that as recently as the Sunday preceding her appointment, her bios reflected Maryland as her residence. By Monday, however, mentions of Maryland were conspicuously absent, sparking curiosity and raising questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;details-and-discoveries&quot;&gt;Details and Discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporters also discovered that Laphonza was registered to vote in Maryland as of the previous year, with Federal Election Commission records displaying her Maryland residence merely 31 days prior to these revelations. Subsequent checks on her professional bios on sites like the pro-abortion rights organization EMILY’s List corroborated these sudden changes. Prior to these alterations, the bio explicitly stated her residence in Maryland, with her partner Neneki Lee and their daughter Nylah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butler has a distinguished and multifaceted career, serving as the president of the largest union in California, SEIU Local 2015, and holding significant roles within the SEIU California State Council. She also played a crucial role as a senior adviser during Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The recent modifications in her bio raise questions about the nuances of state representation, especially considering her deep ties and extensive service within California.&lt;/p&gt;

This shocking incident prompted immediate action from park officials, leading to the euthanization of the bear, which displayed ‘aggressive behavior’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grizzly-encounter-in-picturesque-banff&quot;&gt;Grizzly Encounter in Picturesque Banff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banff National Park is known for its stunning landscapes, crystal-clear lakes, and diverse wildlife, including about 60 grizzly bears. Unfortunately, the park’s natural beauty was overshadowed by a horrifying encounter between visitors and one of its grizzly inhabitants. This deadly incident unfolded in the Red Deer River Valley area, west of Ya Ha Tinda Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swift-response-from-park-officials&quot;&gt;Swift Response from Park Officials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerted by a GPS device signaling a “bear attack,” Parks Canada staff quickly assembled a Wildlife Human Attack Response Team, trained specially for such incidents. Hindered by weather conditions, the team traveled by ground, reaching the site by 1 a.m., where they discovered the bodies of the deceased individuals and encountered the aggressive grizzly. To ensure public safety, the decision was made to euthanize the bear on-site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;victims-loved-the-outdoors&quot;&gt;Victims Loved the Outdoors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victims, identified as a Canadian couple and their dog, were reportedly passionate about the outdoors and were long-term partners. A family member stated, “They lived for being in the backcountry and were two of the most cautious people I know. They knew bear protocol and followed it to a tee,” according to the CBC. The dog, a constant companion, also lost its life in this tragic incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;park-precautions-and-public-safety&quot;&gt;Park Precautions and Public Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banff National Park has implemented an area closure as a safety precaution, and it will stay in effect until further notice. This tragic incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of wildlife and the inherent risks of venturing into their habitats. Parks Canada expressed its deepest condolences to the victims’ families and friends, emphasizing the need for public awareness and caution around the park’s wildlife, particularly its bear population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bear-population-in-banff&quot;&gt;Bear Population in Banff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bear population in Banff National Park is a significant aspect of its ecosystem, with about 60 grizzly bears residing in the park. Kim Titchener, the founder of Bear Safety and More, highlighted that their existence in the province is under threat. This incident underscores the delicate balance between wildlife conservation and public safety in natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragic incident in Banff National Park has brought sorrow and a heightened awareness of the dangers posed by wildlife in the area. The importance of following bear protocol and maintaining caution in such environments cannot be understated. As the park continues its efforts to secure the area and monitor wildlife activity, the memory of the victims emphasizes the need for mutual respect between humans and the wild inhabitants of our natural spaces.

Despite concerns and criticisms, city leaders are pushing to maintain an RV parking lot aimed at providing shelter to the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skyrocketing-costs---more-money-fewer-solutions&quot;&gt;Skyrocketing Costs - More Money, Fewer Solutions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco established a safe parking site at &lt;strong&gt;Candlestick Point&lt;/strong&gt; in January 2022, capable of holding 155 recreational vehicles for homeless individuals. However, as of now, the site holds only 35 RVs due to a shortage of electricity. The costs are eye-popping, with each parking spot costing around &lt;strong&gt;$140,000 annually&lt;/strong&gt;, making it the most expensive homeless response intervention in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program’s inefficiencies and the substantial fiscal burden have ignited debates among locals and officials. Yet, the city’s leaders are advocating to extend the lease for this RV parking lot. Despite the substantial costs and evident inefficiencies, the Board of Supervisors’ Homelessness and Behavioral Health Select Committee unanimously recommended in September to continue the program for another two years. If approved, the city is projected to shell out an additional &lt;strong&gt;$12.2 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homeless-crisis---a-glimpse-into-the-magnitude&quot;&gt;Homeless Crisis - A Glimpse into the Magnitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is grappling with a growing homeless crisis, with over &lt;strong&gt;7,754 homeless individuals&lt;/strong&gt;. Out of these, more than &lt;strong&gt;4,000&lt;/strong&gt; live on the streets or in vehicles. The RV lot, since its inception, has served 115 people. However, neighbors living near the RV site believe the project is inefficient and have voiced their concerns, emphasizing that officials need to increase the number of people referred to permanent housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-electricity-dilemma---a-barrier-to-full-capacity&quot;&gt;The Electricity Dilemma - A Barrier to Full Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant barrier to operating at full capacity is the lack of electricity. San Francisco has faced delays and hurdles in establishing a reliable power connection to the site. The city installed diesel generators to power the site, resulting in a federal lawsuit from residents claiming that the generators violate the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing debacle between city officials and PG&amp;amp;E, the electricity company, further complicates matters. Disagreements and missing information during the application process for power connection have led to delays and friction, impeding the resolution of the electricity issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-shelter---the-path-to-permanent-housing&quot;&gt;Beyond Shelter - The Path to Permanent Housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a parking spot is one step, but the real goal is to refer these individuals to permanent housing. So far, the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing has made 13 placements from RVs to permanent housing, but the exact number of people who found permanent housing is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With less than one placement per month, critics argue that providing a monthly rental stipend would be a more cost-effective solution. The City’s continuation of such an inefficient program with the existing level of success seems inconceivable to many local residents and observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-citys-struggle---the-balancing-act&quot;&gt;A City’s Struggle - The Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is walking a tightrope, trying to balance the humanitarian need to support its homeless population and the practical aspects of implementing efficient and cost-effective solutions. The ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the high-cost RV parking lot underscore the challenges the city faces in addressing its homelessness crisis.

&lt;p&gt;The saga surrounding the investigations has sparked numerous controversies, including allegations against Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesley Wolf for restricting investigators from probing whether Joe Biden was the referenced ‘Big Guy.’ Further, IRS investigators highlighted potential campaign finance violations related to Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Kevin Morris. However, instructions were allegedly given to disregard such allegations by Department of Justice officials, stating a lack of personal interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Patel, known for his roles as the Pentagon’s former chief of staff and former deputy director of National Intelligence, heralded Staggs as an “America First champion” capable of confronting the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uniting-the-america-first-faction&quot;&gt;Uniting the ‘America First’ Faction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staggs’ campaign has been gaining traction, especially within conservative circles advocating for America First policies. Patel’s backing is seen as a significant boost, reinforcing Staggs’ stance against the established norms and emphasizing his dedication to upholding conservative values. Patel’s endorsement is crucial, adding considerable weight to Staggs’ Senate bid and potentially influencing other America First advocates to rally behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collapse-of-a-competitor&quot;&gt;The Collapse of a Competitor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staggs originally intended to challenge Sen. Mitt Romney, presenting himself as a conservative alternative. However, following Romney’s announcement not to seek reelection, Staggs is now poised to secure the Republican nomination without facing a primary against the former presidential candidate. This development has opened the floor for Staggs to present himself as the embodiment of America First values and appeal to conservative voters disillusioned with establishment figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ric Grenell, another Trump ally, along with Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, have also endorsed Staggs. His stance against enforcing coronavirus protocols and advocacy for individual freedom have appealed to many conservatives, further solidifying his position in the Senate race. The support from such high-profile figures demonstrates the increasing acceptance and alignment of the Republican party with Staggs’ policies and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upholding-conservative-values&quot;&gt;Upholding Conservative Values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staggs has been vocal about his commitment to conservative principles, opposing what he perceives as the “weaponization” of the Justice Department against political rivals. He has also criticized the availability of “inappropriate” and “pornographic” materials in schools and has vowed to prioritize students’ “physical, mental, and spiritual” safety. This alignment with conservative and family values is likely to resonate with many voters and could play a pivotal role in securing him the Senate seat.&lt;/p&gt;

The measure sailed through on a Saturday night, witnessing a substantial 88-9 vote in favor, relieving countless citizens and federal employees anticipating a freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clinging-to-the-clock&quot;&gt;Clinging to the Clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure, technically referred to as a continuing resolution (CR), had the Senate in suspense, as the fiscal year was ticking to a close, ending at midnight on October 1. The CR was a beacon of hope, intending to fund the government for an additional 45 days. A rejection of this bill would have led to a pause in nonessential government programs and a furlough for thousands of federal employees, raising the stakes for this crucial vote.&lt;/p&gt;

A moment of bipartisan unity, previous proposals from Republicans had failed to garner support from Democrats. However, this resolution witnessed members from both political factions casting their vote in support. The final vote was met with applause, representing a rare moment of unity and shared relief among the lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House Speaker Kevin McCarthy emphasized that this stopgap measure is essential for providing Congress with the required time to “get their work done.” He assured the anxious public and fellow politicians that the House aims to keep the government open and operational for the following 45 days. This extra time is crucial for both the House and the Senate to finalize their agendas and complete any pending tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-disasters&quot;&gt;Addressing Disasters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the immediate goal of preventing a shutdown, the bill also allocates $16 billion in disaster relief, addressing the various calamities that transpired over the summer. However, assistance to Ukraine was notably absent from the funding. McCarthy highlighted the inclusion of the much-needed aid for the disaster-struck areas, referencing the devastating incidents in Florida, Hawaii, California, and Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;

While the resolution is temporary, it has provided a crucial reprieve and paved the way for more comprehensive discussions and negotiations regarding the government’s spending and operational plans. As the government gears up to utilize the granted time efficiently, this event stands as a testament to the significance of unified action in times of crisis.

Sophisticated fraudsters are leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to emulate the distressed voices of children, creating disturbing and realistic scenarios that lead parents into believing their offspring are in severe danger or distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-alarming-innovation-in-scamming&quot;&gt;An Alarming Innovation in Scamming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This AI-driven fraudulence exhibits an unsettling progression in the landscape of scamming, crafting credible emergencies involving the supposed peril of the victims’ children. The scammers employ AI to generate voice simulations, making it appear as if the distressed calls are genuinely coming from their kids, who sound as if they are in agonizing situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one such instance, a mother was duped into believing her 14-year-old daughter was in jail, in need of $15,500 in cash for bail, after supposedly causing a car accident while driving underage. The artificial voice was so convincing that it left the mother prepared to hand over the said amount in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-driven-distress&quot;&gt;AI-Driven Distress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These high-tech scams are meticulously crafted to induce panic and immediate response from the victims. AI programs are fed voice samples obtained from spam calls or content shared on social media, allowing the creation of highly convincing and manipulative auditory scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victims of these sinister scams often find themselves in states of extreme distress, lured into the fabricated crises that seem too real due to the accuracy with which the AI mimics the voices of their loved ones. It is not until later that they realize the deceit, often after suffering substantial financial loss or emotional turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nationwide-awareness-and-response&quot;&gt;Nationwide Awareness and Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been actively spreading awareness about such AI-augmented phone scams since March, recognizing them as part of a broader category of imposter scams. These scams saw a whopping 30% rise from the previous year, deceiving consumers out of approximately $8.8 billion. While younger adults are frequently the targets, older adults tend to suffer more significant financial loss when they succumb to such scams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to combat this novel yet malignant form of fraud, some have stopped posting on social media, while others have established unique code words among family members as a preventive measure. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has also been vigilant, prosecuting various bail-related phone scams and encouraging New Yorkers to report any suspicious activity to their Financial Frauds Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protect-and-prevent&quot;&gt;Protect and Prevent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we venture deeper into the digital age, staying informed and vigilant against evolving fraudulent practices is crucial. While technology brings forth innovative solutions and conveniences, it also opens up avenues for more intricate and harmful deceit.
