A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Aaron Rodgers’ New York Jets Debut Cut Short by Ankle Injury</title><link href="/sports/2023/09/12/Rodgers-Injury-Debut/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Aaron Rodgers’ New York Jets Debut Cut Short by Ankle Injury" /><published>2023-09-12T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-12T09:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/sports/2023/09/12/Rodgers-Injury-Debut</id><content type="html" xml:base="/sports/2023/09/12/Rodgers-Injury-Debut/">&lt;p&gt;Monday night’s highly awaited game between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills saw an unexpected turn as Aaron Rodgers, the newly acquired Jets quarterback, had to exit early. After being on the field for only a few minutes into his debut with the Jets, Rodgers suffered an ankle injury, putting a damper on the night for Jets fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The injury occurred when Buffalo Bills linebacker Leonard Floyd managed to sack Rodgers. Although Rodgers initially attempted to brush off the setback, he soon needed assistance to leave the field. This was a sight no sports fan ever wishes to see – a prominent player being escorted off the field, especially during a debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent broadcasts from ESPN showed Rodgers, with evident difficulty, making his way onto a cart that transported him towards the stadium’s tunnel. He was then spotted limping towards the locker room, and later, with a protective boot on his injured ankle. Before this unfortunate turn of events, Rodgers had yet to complete a pass, with a record of 0-for-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Rodgers out of the picture, the Jets had to rely on Zach Wilson, their former starting quarterback. Wilson, who started for the Jets during his first two seasons, was supposed to be the backup to Rodgers after losing his primary spot towards the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Rodgers, this game was meant to be an exhilarating first with the Jets, having recently showcased his prowess in a preseason match against the New York Giants where he threw an impressive touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson. Pre-game, he had spoken about the “butterflies” he felt during that preseason match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a light-hearted moment before the game, when asked about his feelings on stepping onto the field for his Jets’ debut, Rodgers had humorously remarked that he’d probably be “sobbing.” He had further added that he looked forward to the experience and the energy of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Rodgers and the Jets, the night didn’t go as planned. The extent of Rodgers’ injury remains to be seen, and fans across the nation are hoping for a swift recovery for the renowned quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Sports" /><summary type="html">Monday night’s highly awaited game between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills saw an unexpected turn as Aaron Rodgers, the newly acquired Jets quarterback, had to exit early.

This event, deeply etched in the psyche of Americans, deserved the President’s presence and acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Ted Cruz, in his candid discussion on “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” expressed no surprise at the President’s decision. Cruz emphatically stated that this wasn’t the first time the administration’s actions have come across as out of touch with the sentiments of the American public, especially those directly affected by the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a mistake. I think the president has an obligation to tell the American people what it was about, to bring them together,” Cruz rightly pointed out. This view gains even more significance when one considers the recent news surrounding plea deals involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be a primary architect of the 9/11 attacks. The Pentagon, under the Biden administration, was seemingly inclined towards these plea deals, ostensibly to circumvent the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unsettling nature of these potential plea deals sparked widespread condemnation. Cruz, along with Representative Nicole Malliotakis from New York, sent a clarion call against such decisions. Their voices, echoing the anguish and concerns of millions of Americans, seem to have resonated, with the administration consequently backing down from the proposed plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruz didn’t hold back in highlighting a pattern of concerning decisions: “But when it comes to this administration and foreign policy, they’ve put politics ahead of everything. This administration doesn’t want to talk about 9/11. They want to put 9/11 behind them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse is the perceived connection between these questionable decisions and the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. The move was hurriedly executed, seemingly to align with the 9/11 anniversary, notwithstanding serious apprehensions from officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Gem No More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a set of distressing videos were shared on Twitter by local activist Jamie Hammonds. The footage paints a bleak picture of the greenbelt — trash, including liquor bottles, needles, and other debris, stretches “as far as the eye can see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammonds candidly commented on the video, lamenting, “It’s just been destroyed.” He compared the situation to the degradation of the Violet Crown, another greenbelt compromised by a homeless encampment earlier in the year. “It is so much worse than the Violet Crown Trail,” Hammonds emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City’s Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the alarming deterioration of the greenbelt, approximately 72 encampment residents, along with their pets, were moved to the city-managed Southbridge shelter in mid-August, an action under Austin’s Housing-Focused Encampment Assistance Link (HEAL) Initiative. The city’s approach to the escalating homelessness issue is focused on relocating encampments that present significant “public health and safety risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this wasn’t the first time such an intervention was deemed necessary. In under two years, Austin officials have had to relocate residents from similar encampments twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin is currently orchestrating a cleanup operation for West Bouldin Creek. With multiple departments on the task, the cleanup could span from weeks to potentially several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relocation followed incidents around the encampment that roused public safety apprehensions. Earlier this year, a SWAT team recovered stolen military-grade weapons and ammunition from the camp. Recent reports also include a brush fire igniting at another homeless camp near MoPac and Park Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Funding and the Way Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin has earmarked a staggering $55 million for housing stabilization, crisis response, and public space management. Furthermore, they’ve channeled over $100 million from the American Rescue Plan Act into enhancing homeless services and related system improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Council Member José “Chito” Vela emphasized the critical need for mental health and substance use treatments. He highlighted these treatments, when combined with housing, will play a pivotal role in a holistic homelessness prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For locals like Greg Smith, who resides near the West Bouldin Creek, there’s still hope. While acknowledging the complexity of the challenge ahead, he believes that the solution, though possibly spanning several years, is within reach. Smith’s faith remains unwavering in Austin’s community spirit. “I believe that Austin residents…will do whatever they can to help those folks who are experiencing homelessness and get their green space back,” Smith concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Austin, Texas, a city renowned for its vibrant arts scene and natural beauty, is grappling with an escalating issue — the extensive damage caused to its West Bouldin Creek Greenbelt by a homeless encampment.

&lt;p&gt;Happening outside one of Aldean’s recent concerts in Chicago, the group’s heated demonstration involved vitriolic chants against the U.S. and the artist. Their distorted perception labels the country anthem, which celebrates the core values of America, as “fascist.” It’s a reminder of the far-left’s increasing intolerance towards differing viewpoints and its attempts to stifle voices that challenge their narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such aggressive antics, Jason Aldean remains unfazed, with his song’s popularity soaring to the top of several charts. This is a testament to the song’s resonance with vast sections of the American populace, who identify with its message. It’s ironic that while corporate giants like Paramount-owned CMT chose to censor the song’s music video, the public responded by amplifying its reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics, likely driven by political biases, have wrongfully labelled the song as racist, without providing substantive evidence. Aldean’s track, in reality, critiques the unchecked rioting and lawlessness witnessed in 2020, emphasizing a need for order and respect for community values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the prominent figures defending Aldean’s right to freedom of speech is former President Donald Trump. He lauded the country singer on Truth Social, highlighting Aldean’s genuine talent and urging the public to support him.&lt;/p&gt;

Leading the charge, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., based his feeble argument on a benign interview Alito gave to the Wall Street Journal, where one of the attending journalists, David B. Rivkin, happened to be an attorney involved in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Alito, highlighting the shallow waters in which Durbin’s argument wades, stated unequivocally, “This argument is unsound,” further adding, “There is no valid reason for my recusal in this case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot ignore the unending pressures from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who have been tirelessly targeting Alito and his peers for not adopting their prescribed ethics code. This, despite the ethical quandaries arising from undisclosed trips by justices, which are not exclusive to the conservative members of the bench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Durbin’s zealous attempt to undermine the integrity of the Supreme Court, he has failed to recognize the clear distinction between professional courtesy and potential conflict of interest. Alito’s interactions with Rivkin were nothing more than a standard journalistic interaction. Suggesting that Alito’s capacity to remain impartial is compromised based on this interaction is not only a stretch but an affront to the dignity of the justice’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durbin’s accusations are amplified by the alarming assertion that Alito’s views on Congressional authority over the Supreme Court are controversial. Alito’s remarks about Congress lacking the “authority” to regulate the Supreme Court underscores the doctrine of separation of powers – a foundational principle of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the partisan jabs, Justice Alito expertly articulated the complexities and nuances of the Supreme Court’s operations. He explained, “We have no control over the attorneys whom parties select to represent them… If we recused in such cases, we would regularly have less than a full bench, and the Court’s work would be substantially disrupted and distorted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Alito’s resolute stance against the Democrats’ untenable demands serves as a beacon of hope for many who cherish the sanctity of America’s judicial system. It is paramount for the Supreme Court to remain above the fray of partisan politics, ensuring that justice is dispensed fairly, impartially, and according to the rule of law. Anything less would undermine the very fabric of American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a display of unwavering integrity and dedication to the principles of the American legal system, Justice Samuel Alito firmly dismissed the ill-founded demands of Senate Democrats for his recusal from the upcoming Supreme Court case. Leading the charge, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., based his feeble argument on a benign interview Alito gave to the Wall Street Journal, where one of the attending journalists, David B. Rivkin, happened to be an attorney involved in the case. Justice Alito, highlighting the shallow waters in which Durbin’s argument wades, stated unequivocally, “This argument is unsound,” further adding, “There is no valid reason for my recusal in this case.” One cannot ignore the unending pressures from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who have been tirelessly targeting Alito and his peers for not adopting their prescribed ethics code. This, despite the ethical quandaries arising from undisclosed trips by justices, which are not exclusive to the conservative members of the bench. In Durbin’s zealous attempt to undermine the integrity of the Supreme Court, he has failed to recognize the clear distinction between professional courtesy and potential conflict of interest. Alito’s interactions with Rivkin were nothing more than a standard journalistic interaction. Suggesting that Alito’s capacity to remain impartial is compromised based on this interaction is not only a stretch but an affront to the dignity of the justice’s position. Durbin’s accusations are amplified by the alarming assertion that Alito’s views on Congressional authority over the Supreme Court are controversial. Alito’s remarks about Congress lacking the “authority” to regulate the Supreme Court underscores the doctrine of separation of powers – a foundational principle of the U.S. Constitution. In response to the partisan jabs, Justice Alito expertly articulated the complexities and nuances of the Supreme Court’s operations. He explained, “We have no control over the attorneys whom parties select to represent them… If we recused in such cases, we would regularly have less than a full bench, and the Court’s work would be substantially disrupted and distorted.” Justice Alito’s resolute stance against the Democrats’ untenable demands serves as a beacon of hope for many who cherish the sanctity of America’s judicial system. It is paramount for the Supreme Court to remain above the fray of partisan politics, ensuring that justice is dispensed fairly, impartially, and according to the rule of law. Anything less would undermine the very fabric of American democracy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Royal Dissent - Britons Favor Ousting Prince Harry from Throne Succession</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/11/Royal-Dissent/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Royal Dissent - Britons Favor Ousting Prince Harry from Throne Succession" /><published>2023-09-11T16:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-11T16:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/11/Royal-Dissent</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/11/Royal-Dissent/">&lt;p&gt;The tides of popularity have dramatically shifted for Prince Harry in the UK. Recent findings from a Deltapoll conducted for the Daily Mail reveal that an overwhelming 61% of Britons believe that Prince Harry should be excluded from the line to the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry, once a widely cherished member of the British Royal Family, saw a precipitous drop in his public standing following his marriage to American actress Meghan Markle. Although Harry stepped away from his royal duties to pursue roles in entertainment and activism, he currently stands fifth in the royal line of succession. This sequence places him behind his elder brother Prince William and William’s children, Prince George, Prince Louis, and Princess Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Meghan doesn’t hold a position in the line of succession, similar to her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales. However, Meghan’s children with Harry, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, are presently sixth and seventh in line for the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry and Meghan’s reputation has experienced a considerable decline in the UK over recent years. The couple, often described as ‘woke’, have openly expressed their challenges within the Royal Family, making serious accusations, including claims of racism. Such accusations have reportedly strained relations between Prince Harry, King Charles III, and Prince William. Reports even suggested that the couple’s sharp criticisms deeply upset the late Queen Elizabeth II, particularly in the twilight of her life, battling bone marrow cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the consensus against Harry’s place in the royal line, the dominant view among the British populace is that Harry and Meghan should not benefit from public funding. This sentiment emerges despite the couple’s reported earnings of around £100 million from media deals since their 2020 move to the United States. Notwithstanding their substantial earnings, Meghan and Harry have sought taxpayer-funded police protection during their visits to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The tides of popularity have dramatically shifted for Prince Harry in the UK.

Since his escape from Chester County Prison over a week ago, there have been multiple confirmed sightings of Cavalcante, but he remains at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday, Pennsylvania State Police provided an update indicating that Cavalcante, who had originally been the focus of a search centered around the Longwood Gardens botanical park, was now seen near Phoenixville in northern Chester County. This location is over 20 miles northeast of the earlier search area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to possibly divert attention and complicate the manhunt, Cavalcante has altered his appearance. He’s now clean-shaven and was last seen wearing a yellow or green hooded sweatshirt, black baseball cap, green prison pants, and white shoes. Additionally, he’s believed to be driving a stolen 2020 White Ford Transit van, which bears a refrigeration unit on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for Cavalcante’s initial incarceration was a life sentence handed down after he was found guilty of fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend in 2021. His motivation, prosecutors assert, was to prevent her from revealing to the police that he was a wanted murderer in his home country of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances of his escape raise eyebrows. Cavalcante achieved his freedom by scaling a wall, navigating over razor wire, and eventually jumping off a roof to the ground. What’s astonishing is that his disappearance went unnoticed for over an hour until a routine headcount revealed the discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prison tower guard on duty during this escape has since been dismissed. This bold escape, coupled with a manhunt that has attracted international attention, is also making headlines in Brazil. There, Cavalcante is accused of another heinous crime - the “double qualified homicide” of Válter Júnior Moreira dos Reis in 2017, purportedly over a vehicle repair debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While local festivities, such as the annual mushroom festival in Kennett Square, proceeded as planned, assurances of “all necessary precautions and protocols” couldn’t entirely assuage the heightened anxiety of residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Cavalcante’s demonstrated ability to elude capture and the description of him as “extremely dangerous” by authorities, the community is urged to be vigilant. The state police have mobilized a large-scale search operation involving tactical teams, tracking dogs, officers on horseback, and aircraft. A $20,000 reward is now on the table for information leading to his apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents and visitors are encouraged to remain cautious and report any suspicious activities. As the hunt for Cavalcante intensifies, one can only hope for a swift and safe resolution to this unnerving saga.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The community in southeastern Pennsylvania remains on edge as Danelo Souza Cavalcante, an escaped murderer, proves adept at evading authorities.

From its high-profile members to the drama surrounding its practices, the Church of Scientology often finds itself under the Tinseltown spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;danny-masterson-and-scientologys-trial-tangle&quot;&gt;Danny Masterson and Scientology’s Trial Tangle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actor Danny Masterson, best known for his role in “That ’70s Show,” recently faced a rape trial where his faith became a significant talking point. Found guilty on two counts of forcible rape, Masterson’s sentencing shed light on the secretive world of Scientology. Though the Church was not directly implicated in the case, the trial proceedings painted a troubling picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims, all members of the Church at the time, were reportedly hesitant to come forward due to the organization’s strict protocols against public involvement with member issues. Deputy District Attorney Ariel Anson told jurors, “The church taught his victims: ‘Rape isn’t rape, you caused this, and above all, you are never allowed to go to law enforcement.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a counter-statement, the Church of Scientology stated, “The Church was not a party to this case and religion did not belong in this proceeding as Supreme Court precedent has maintained for centuries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Scientologist Leah Remini has been one of the Church’s most vocal critics since she left in 2013. Celebrating Masterson’s victims for their courage, she commented, “I am relieved that this dangerous rapist will be off the streets and unable to violently assault and rape women with the help of Scientology, a multi-billion-dollar criminal organization with tax-exempt status.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Remini hasn’t limited her criticisms to this recent trial. In her award-winning documentary series, she delves deep into the Church’s practices, sharing insights and exposing what she believes are its harmful activities. The Church, in response, has dismissed her claims as attempts “to appear relevant again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No discussion of Scientology and Hollywood would be complete without mentioning Tom Cruise. One of the Church’s most high-profile members, Cruise has remained largely loyal to his faith even as controversies raged around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, his relationships, notably with Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes, have brought attention to the religion’s influence in personal matters. Remini alluded that Scientology played a role in Cruise’s split with Holmes, citing the Church’s tendency to label detractors as suppressive persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, filmmaker Paul Haggis, a former member, faced legal troubles connected to allegations of rape, with some speculating on the Church’s role in his life and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
