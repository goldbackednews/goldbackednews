A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Taking Charge - Kamala Harris Heads New Office of Gun Violence Prevention</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking Charge - Kamala Harris Heads New Office of Gun Violence Prevention" /><published>2023-09-23T07:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-23T07:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative/">&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris has been chosen by President Joe Biden to lead a groundbreaking new executive-level Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

Recently, McGraw warmed millions of hearts with his sweet birthday message to his wife, shedding light on their harmonious life together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-love-note-that-strikes-a-chord&quot;&gt;A Love Note that Strikes a Chord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrating 27 years of togetherness, McGraw took to Instagram to share a public love note on Hill’s 56th birthday. Calling her his “best friend,” “partner,” and the “love of his life,” he shared a glamorous photo of Hill, adding, “You light up every room you walk into. And you light up my heart and soul.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message was not only a testament to their enduring bond but also a reminder of the couple’s mutual respect and admiration, with McGraw emphasizing, “I love you more than I could ever express in a million years. This is your day my love!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGraw attributes a significant part of his successful career and 15-year sobriety journey to his marriage with Hill. He believes that without her, his career would probably have “ran into the ground,” and he wouldn’t be where he is today.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is reportedly on a mission to reinstate the traditional Senate dress code, a policy recently relaxed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). This development suggests a rising disagreement within the party lines over the decorum of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;return-to-formality&quot;&gt;Return to Formality?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchin is believed to be circulating a proposal to restore the formal dress code, requiring Senators to don business attire on the Senate floor. This push comes in direct contrast to Schumer’s recent pronouncement, allowing Senators to choose their preferred dress while on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fettermans-fashion-statement&quot;&gt;Fetterman’s Fashion Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) is particularly noticeable under the new dress code, appearing in sweatshirts and shorts in the Capitol. His unconventional attire, in alignment with his “blue-collar tough guy” persona, contrasts sharply with his Harvard education and seemingly affluent background. His attire has sparked conversations on authenticity, with many questioning the sincerity behind his average joe portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voices-in-opposition&quot;&gt;Voices in Opposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans and even some Democrats seem to support the return to a more formal dress code. They argue that maintaining a degree of formality and dignity is crucial to uphold the reputation of the Senate. Sen. Tommy Tuberville expressed his displeasure with the relaxed dress code, emphasizing his discontent with the casual attires. Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins believes that maintaining a formal dress code is integral to preserving the dignity of the Senate institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dispute over dress code may reflect deeper tensions within the Senate, touching on notions of decorum, respect, and the image senators wish to project. While some view the relaxed dress code as a degradation of Senate traditions, others may see it as a step towards modernization and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Manchin’s move to restore formal attire could be interpreted as a pursuit to maintain the sanctity and the revered image of the Senate. Whether his proposal will gain enough traction remains to be seen, but it certainly highlights the differing perspectives within the Senate on maintaining tradition versus embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Sen.

In a discussion on Newsmax’s “American Agenda,” he voiced concerns over the significant influence and control exercised by the authorities during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-impact-on-education&quot;&gt;The Impact on Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson criticized the sweeping measures, such as school shutdowns, arguing they have had severe and long-lasting impacts on the learning and development of children. He believes it could take years, if not decades, for the educational setbacks experienced during the pandemic to be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allegations-of-manipulation&quot;&gt;Allegations of Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former HUD Secretary accuses the government of not prioritizing the welfare of the citizens and focusing instead on controlling and manipulating people. He fears the grave implications if such practices continue and calls for a critical examination of the repercussions of the mandates imposed during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funding-for-at-home-covid-tests&quot;&gt;Funding for At-Home COVID Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement of a $600 million funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests, Carson emphasized the importance of not succumbing to fear and manipulation. This funding initiative is aimed at averting possible shortages during an anticipated rise in coronavirus cases during the colder months and resolving supply chain issues experienced during past surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carsons-clarion-call&quot;&gt;Carson’s Clarion Call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson’s strong message to the American people is to not be “manipulated and terrified by COVID.” He urges rationality and an understanding of the facts surrounding the virus, such as its evolving, typically weaker variants. He warns against unnecessary fear due to increased positive test results and calls for resistance against any attempts to impose further business and school shutdowns which could lead to economic distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-the-people&quot;&gt;We, The People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Carson’s plea is for vigilance and a unified stance by the people against government overreach and control. He emphasizes that it is the collective responsibility of the citizens to assert their rights and safeguard their freedoms against any perceived attempts to disrupt lives and livelihoods under the guise of public health measures. He argues that a repeat of the stringent controls and mandates witnessed during the pandemic could have devastating and lasting impacts on the society and economy, making it imperative for the people to be informed, rational, and resolute in their response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Ben Carson, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, raises the alarm on what he perceives as attempts by the U.S. government to control the American populace through mandates related to COVID-19.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-rallying-cry&quot;&gt;Trump’s Rallying Cry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump argued that the Republicans “can and must” obstruct Biden’s policies, depicting the current administration as hostile and accusing it of treating “half the Country as Enemies of the State.” Trump insists this is the opportune moment for Republicans to retaliate against what he perceives as political prosecutions aimed at him and other conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

Conservative Republicans are demanding a stringent fiscal approach, with appropriations not exceeding a</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unlocking Nature’s Secrets - AI Bridges Communication Gap Between Humans and Animals!</title><link href="/news/2023/09/22/Talking-To-Animals/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unlocking Nature’s Secrets - AI Bridges Communication Gap Between Humans and Animals!" /><published>2023-09-22T14:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-22T14:06:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/22/Talking-To-Animals</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/22/Talking-To-Animals/">&lt;p&gt;The fascinating prospect of communicating with animals has been a tantalizing fantasy, filling the pages of countless science fiction stories and movies.

&lt;p&gt;Imagine understanding the sophisticated clicks of sperm whales or the varied chirps of birds! Researchers are using advanced AI to interpret and translate the communications of various animals, ranging from the familiar barks of dogs to the enchanting songs of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Earth Species Project, believes that we are nearing a time when having “conversations” with animals will be feasible. He envisions a future where understanding expressions of ‘grief’, ‘mother’, or ‘hunger’ will be common across different species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-barks-and-tweets&quot;&gt;Beyond Barks and Tweets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about the sounds; researchers are delving deeper, aiming to interpret expressions, postures, and other forms of communication. Dr. Con Slobodchikoff, an animal language researcher, is working on models that translate not just the barks of dogs but also their facial expressions, giving pet owners a clearer understanding of what their furry companions are trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endeavors are not restricted to our traditional pets. Shane Gero, the lead biologist for Project CETI, is employing AI to decipher the intricate patterns of sperm whale sounds, with the hopeful outcome of creating a “whale chatbot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-the-great-divide&quot;&gt;Bridging the Great Divide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary research is about more than mere translation; it’s about bridging the great communication divide between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has developed a tool capable of distinguishing the sounds of over a thousand bird species, and AI-generated bird calls are being tested on zebra finches by the Earth Species Project.&lt;/p&gt;

A formal letter from the UK Parliament’s Culture, Media, and Sports Committee Chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, asked Rumble whether it planned to demonetize comedian and commentator Russell Brand’s channel following serious allegations of rape and sexual assault against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parliaments-appeal-and-rumbles-stance&quot;&gt;Parliament’s Appeal and Rumble’s Stance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to Rumble came in the wake of YouTube’s decision to demonetize Brand’s account. The UK Parliament expressed concerns over Brand profiting from content on Rumble amidst the grave accusations and inquired about Rumble’s intentions regarding Brand’s ability to earn money on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Rumble issued a staunch response, refusing to demonetize Brand’s channel and labelled the Parliament’s letter as “disturbing”. They defended their stance on the grounds of upholding free speech and the principle that every individual is entitled to a full and serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rumble stands for very different values. We have devoted ourselves to the vital cause of defending a free internet – meaning an internet where no one arbitrarily dictates which ideas can or cannot be heard, or which citizens may or may not be entitled to a platform,” Rumble said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-allegations-against-brand&quot;&gt;The Allegations Against Brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple women have accused Russell Brand of rape and sexual assault, as reported by Channel 4 news network and the Sunday Times in Britain. Brand, however, has vehemently denied all the allegations against him. These serious accusations have led various platforms to review their relationships with Brand, and some, like YouTube, to take decisive action against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-implications-and-repercussions&quot;&gt;Wider Implications and Repercussions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumble argues that the allegations against Brand, which are yet to be proven in a court of law, are not related to his video content, and it is “deeply inappropriate and dangerous” for the UK Parliament to attempt to control who is allowed to speak on their platform or to earn a living from doing so. They highlighted the absence of any connection between the allegations and his content on Rumble as a significant factor in their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok and other media outlets, including the BBC, Channel 4, and GB News, have also been approached by the committee for clarification on their positions regarding Brand and his ability to monetize his posts, especially those related to the allegations against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ongoing situation brings to the forefront the delicate balance between freedom of speech and accountability. Rumble’s refusal to bend to the pressure from Parliament underscores the debate around the extent of control and influence governmental bodies should have over content on internet platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake’s impassioned campaigning isn’t limited to Arizona; she has journeyed through 14 states over the past three months to lead events and support Republican organizations on various levels. She has endorsed several candidates in Senate races and even thrown her weight behind Mayor Trent Staggs of Riverton, Utah, and businessman Bernie Moreno in Ohio, portraying her as a significant figure in the Republican realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early polls suggest Lake could be a leading contender in a hypothetical Republican primary. She faces potential competition from figures like Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and businessman Blake Masters.
