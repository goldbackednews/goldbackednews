A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Hollywood Actor Gary Busey - Another Accident Controversy</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/07/Gary-Busey-Investigation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hollywood Actor Gary Busey - Another Accident Controversy" /><published>2023-09-07T15:49:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T15:49:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/07/Gary-Busey-Investigation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/07/Gary-Busey-Investigation/">&lt;p&gt;Gary Busey, famed for his roles in blockbuster hits like “Lethal Weapon” and “Point Break,” is under the spotlight yet again, this time for his alleged involvement in a hit-and-run car accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent August afternoon, while driving his blue Volvo along Malibu’s scenic stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, Busey reportedly collided with another vehicle. The incident, as described in a report from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, escalated when the “Point Break” actor allegedly fled the scene without stopping post-impact or providing any proof of registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accident’s details are still under official investigation. However, the driver of the vehicle Busey collided with claims to have recognized the actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Accidents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busey’s history with accidents is, unfortunately, not new. In 2015, while backing out of a parking spot in Malibu, Busey accidentally hit and slightly injured a woman. Although he was cited at the time, neither alcohol nor illegal substances were found to have played a part in the accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant and life-altering accident involving Busey occurred in 1988. While riding his motorcycle without a helmet, Busey met with a severe crash that fractured his skull and led to permanent brain damage. Recounting the tragic event to The Guardian in 2020, Busey described a near-death experience that took him to a spiritual realm. The actor views the accident as an essential part of his life’s journey and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials and Tribulations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busey’s life post the 1988 accident, though filled with continued professional endeavors, hasn’t been without significant controversies. Last summer, he faced multiple charges, including fourth-degree criminal sexual contact and harassment, after an alleged incident at the DoubleTree Hotel in New Jersey. While Busey denies any wrongdoing, it’s clear that the star’s journey has been a complex blend of highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As investigations regarding the recent hit-and-run continue, fans and critics alike await more clarity on the incident.

&lt;p&gt;As Texas grapples with a surging wave of unauthorized border crossings, a recent legal decision is causing ripples of concern among proponents of stringent border security measures. A U.S. judge has called for the relocation of floating buoys in the Rio Grande, key barriers that Texas Governor Greg Abbott had put in place to deter illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floating Barriers: Essential Defense or Navigational Hazard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge David Ezra mandated the removal of these strategically placed buoys from the river’s midpoint to an embankment on the Texan side. The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit initiated by President Joe Biden’s administration, claiming that Texas had placed these barriers unlawfully, potentially disrupting navigation without the explicit permission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move raises eyebrows among those who see these barriers as an essential component in the toolkit of border control strategies that Texas has employed under Governor Abbott’s watch. The governor, known for his robust approach to immigration, has not just stopped at floating barriers but also incorporated razor wire coils along the riverbank to ensure the state’s borders remain secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Ezra’s 42-page order took a rather dismissive tone, emphasizing that Texas failed to ask for the necessary authorization for these barriers. He stated, “Governor Abbott announced that he was not ‘asking for permission’ for Operation Lone Star… Unfortunately for Texas, permission is exactly what federal law requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle for a Secure Border Continues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent decision, questions are emerging about the potential gaps this could create in the state’s defense against unauthorized crossings, especially given the record numbers of migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally in recent years. The growing discord between federal stances and state measures on border control highlights the intricate challenges Texas faces in its pursuit to secure its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the broader debate on border security persists, many hope Texas will appeal this decision, given the vital role these barriers play in the state’s protective measures. This development underscores the tension and complexity surrounding the task of ensuring both national security and adhering to federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Critical Blow to Texas Border Security Amidst Rising Immigration Concerns As Texas grapples with a surging wave of unauthorized border crossings, a recent legal decision is causing ripples of concern among proponents of stringent border security measures.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Alzheimer’s, other health challenges faced by Barker in his later years included hypertension (high blood pressure), hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol).

His signature charm and affable demeanor made him a favorite among both housewives and young ones spending a sick day away from school.&lt;/p&gt;

In the aftermath of a heinous crime that sent shockwaves through Madison, Wisconsin’s serene streets, justice seems to be on the horizon. The Madison police, in a significant breakthrough, have arrested a suspect believed to be behind the brutal assault on a University of Wisconsin-Madison student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Arrest in Disturbing Case&lt;/strong&gt;
The city breathed a collective sigh of relief as 26-year-old Brandon A. Thompson was taken into custody. Thompson, a Madison resident, now faces charges of first-degree sexual assault, first-degree reckless injury, and strangulation, as confirmed by Madison police spokeswoman Alyssa Cains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student’s life was tragically and abruptly upended in the early hours of a Sunday morning. Discovered near Lake Monona, she was left with life-threatening injuries following a savage sidewalk assault. The nature and brutality of the attack had left the community in palpable fear and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspect’s Apprehension: A Momentary Respite&lt;/strong&gt;
The arrest of Thompson, particularly given that the assault was believed to be a chance encounter with a stranger, provides a degree of closure and safety to a community grappling with the trauma of the incident. The victim, reports suggest, endured a nightmarish ordeal, having been abducted from the sidewalk and subjected to physical and sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Ahead: Ensuring Safety in Madison&lt;/strong&gt;
While Thompson’s arrest marks significant progress in this case, Madison stands at an important crossroads. This incident has highlighted the pressing need for reinforced safety measures, more patrolling, and enhanced community vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the suspect in custody, the focus shifts towards healing, community resilience, and fortifying measures to ensure that Madison’s streets remain safe for every resident and student.

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Trump highlighted the distinctive strength and respect commanded by his administration in comparison to the Biden leadership. He discussed his deal with the Taliban, emphasizing that any violation on their part met with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former President stated, “So we [had] a step-by-step agreement. They didn’t fulfill certain steps, and therefore, we knocked the hell out of them. We didn’t lose a soldier in 18 months.” This stands in stark contrast to the violence and instability faced by American troops during the Obama administration, where Taliban snipers were a constant threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s remarks point towards the hands-on, no-nonsense approach that his administration adopted. A significant conversation with Taliban leader Abdul underlined this approach, following which the U.S. didn’t lose a single soldier for a year and a half. Trump reiterated, “They had total respect for us. And we were going to get out, but we were going to get out with dignity and strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In drawing this comparison, Trump seems to make a clear distinction between the calculated strategy adopted by his administration and the perceived hastiness and lack of preparedness under Biden.

&lt;p&gt;Harris’ claim of readiness comes as a shock to many, especially when juxtaposed against her waning popularity; a staggering 49% of registered voters hold a negative view of her, with 39% of them harboring a “very negative view.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an interview in Jakarta, Indonesia, Harris addressed President Biden’s age and health, stating she was prepared to fulfill her constitutional duty should he become unable to govern. While Harris deemed such a scenario as “hypothetical,” she emphasized that every Vice President must acknowledge the responsibility of possibly taking over the presidential role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many critics argue that Harris’ comments underscore a lack of confidence in President Biden’s fitness to serve, given his advanced age. President Biden, at 80 years old, is the oldest serving president in U.S. history. A recent AP/NORC poll revealed that a significant 77% of Americans, including 69% of Democrats, deem him too old for a second term. Such findings make Harris’ remarks all the more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris’ history as a presidential candidate, which saw her campaign fizzle out post-Democratic primary debates in 2020, is also cited by critics as a testament to her lack of widespread appeal and leadership potential. She earned fewer pledged delegates than Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or even Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the evident public reservations about her competence, Harris continues to assert her authority on multiple fronts, even holding former President Trump accountable for the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This is seen by some as an attempt to bolster her standing as a firm leader and capable presidential successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2024 election season heating up and potential competitors like Trump gaining momentum, Harris’ remarks about her readiness to take the presidential reins have not only reignited debates about Biden’s capability but have also led many to question whether Harris herself possesses the leadership qualities the country needs in these turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Vice President Kamala Harris has once again captured headlines, this time not for her diminishing approval ratings, but her comments about potentially assuming the presidency if President Biden were to be incapacitated.

With the 2024 election season heating up and potential competitors like Trump gaining momentum, Harris’ remarks about her readiness to take the presidential reins have not only reignited debates about Biden’s capability but have also led many to question whether Harris herself possesses the leadership qualities the country needs in these turbulent times.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google’s Playground Rules - A Tentative Truce in App Store Battle</title><link href="/news/2023/09/07/Google-Antitrust-Settlement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google’s Playground Rules - A Tentative Truce in App Store Battle" /><published>2023-09-07T10:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T10:03:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/07/Google-Antitrust-Settlement</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/07/Google-Antitrust-Settlement/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Do No Evil” or “Do Know Evil?”&lt;/strong&gt;
Google, the tech giant known for its search engine prowess, is in the news again – and not necessarily for a groundbreaking product launch. This time, it’s about potentially bending the rules of the digital playground it heavily influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Store Showdown&lt;/strong&gt;
In a move that’s been called a “significant development,” Google has tentatively put its seal on a settlement concerning the ever-controversial Google Play Store. This settlement potentially addresses the grievances of consumers and various state attorneys general who have accused the digital titan of leveraging its colossal power to dominate and control the Android app market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an impending lawsuit that threatened to involve a whopping 21 million users demanding damages for what they claim were inflated app prices, this tentative agreement may have saved the day for Google. These users claim Google’s policy of taking a 30% cut from sales on its Play Store led to unjustifiably high prices – a clear mark of anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial or Truce?&lt;/strong&gt;
The recent court filing hints at a mutual desire to avoid the looming trial set for early November. Attorneys from both sides have sought the judge’s approval to put the trial on hold. However, in the twist-filled world of legal battles, if the judge decides to reject the settlement, it would mean a return to the litigation drawing board for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specifics of the settlement remain locked behind closed doors, its potential implications cannot be overstated. If the initial lawsuit claims were anything to go by, this case isn’t just about Google – it’s about the digital marketplace as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control or Monopoly?&lt;/strong&gt;
State attorneys general, in their complaint, brought attention to Google’s alleged anticompetitive strategies, stating that developers were almost strong-armed into using the Google Play store. This argument resonates with many who feel that both Google and Apple are exerting an almost monopolistic control over digital marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the digital ink dries on this chapter of Google’s legal adventures, and as we wait for further comments from involved parties, it raises essential questions about the balance of power in our increasingly digital world. Do giants like Google have too much sway? And if so, what does that mean for consumers, developers, and the future of the digital realm?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">“Do No Evil” or “Do Know Evil?” Google, the tech giant known for its search engine prowess, is in the news again – and not necessarily for a groundbreaking product launch.

The actor shared a series of disturbing incidents from his childhood in New York City, a world away from the big screens where he usually graces his fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being a guest on iHeart’s “Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi” podcast, Broderick painted a vivid picture of his childhood, where he recalled being targeted often in neighborhoods near Washington Square North, the Village, Times Square, and the Upper West Side. “I got mugged often,” he stated, recounting incidents that started as young as 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confrontations weren’t always benign. Broderick spoke of one particular event when he was skateboarding through Central Park. Without warning, a large gang confronted him, and he remembered, “I got whacked in the head with some sort of stick!” Thankfully, he and his friend managed to escape, albeit with stolen possessions and a scar to remember the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this wasn’t an isolated event. The actor shared more unsettling encounters, from bullies demanding lunch money to much graver situations on New York’s subway, where strangers would threaten and interrogate him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the advice he received during those times, Broderick mentioned a school visit by a police officer who guided the kids on handling such situations. “Always bring money with you… immediately give it up and try to make the experience as fast as possible,” was the wisdom he received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew’s narrative paints a stark contrast to today’s protective environment for children. He recalls that his parents, although informed about the muggings, “weren’t as watchful as we are to our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away from these somber memories, Matthew Broderick has built a successful career and a loving family. Married to the iconic “Sex and the City” actress Sarah Jessica Parker for over two and a half decades, the couple is parents to three children - James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters, Tabitha and Marion, 13.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Notorious for his roles in films like “Wargames” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” Matthew Broderick took a moment to shed light on a less glamorous side of his past during a recent podcast.

But the Chino Valley Unified School District thinks otherwise, as evidenced by their new policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Rights Overlooked&lt;/strong&gt;
The Chino Valley Unified School District has come under fire with a recent policy, aiming to notify parents only if students specifically request a change in gender pronouns or identities. Thankfully, a California judge, showing a profound understanding of the importance of parental involvement, issued a temporary restraining order against this misguided attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Rob Bonta may argue that the policy “rightfully upholds the state rights of our LGBTQ+ student community,” but what about the fundamental rights of parents? Aren’t they stakeholders in their children’s well-being, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangers of Non-Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;
The notion that the district could be putting the well-being of transgender and gender-nonconforming students at risk is not in question. The real peril, however, lies in sidelining parents from these crucial discussions. Such decisions about gender identity can have deep emotional, psychological, and even medical implications. Parents should be allies in these journeys, not kept in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonta alleges dangers from “forced disclosures,” but what about the dangers of keeping secrets? Many families offer safe environments where children can freely discuss their identities. Assuming all parents are adversaries can be just as damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;
Bonta’s press releases underline the “threats” posed by policies like Chino Valley’s. But it’s critical to note that several districts, such as Anderson Union High School and Murrieta Valley Unified, are also under scrutiny for similar protocols. Why is there a push for secrecy? It raises the question: What’s the bigger agenda at play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
The ongoing battle around parental notification, with a preliminary injunction hearing set for Oct. 13, promises to be contentious. But one thing remains crystal clear: sidelining parents from the narratives of their children’s lives is a dangerous game. It’s high time school districts recognize this and prioritize open, transparent dialogues that involve all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">It’s common sense: Parents have the right to know what’s happening in their children’s lives, especially when it involves significant decisions at school.
