A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/23/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-23T10:15:05-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-23T10:15:05-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/23/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/23/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Navigating New Horizons: How AI is Reshaping the Book Industry</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/10/23/AI-Impact-on-Publishing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Navigating New Horizons: How AI is Reshaping the Book Industry" /><published>2023-10-23T10:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-23T10:05:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/10/23/AI-Impact-on-Publishing</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/10/23/AI-Impact-on-Publishing/">&lt;p&gt;The introduction of ChatGPT and similar AI writing tools has sent ripples through various sectors, with the book industry being the latest to grapple with the ramifications of this technological advancement. The growing trend of AI-generated content has raised crucial questions about intellectual property, authorship, and the quality of computer-written books, highlighting a deep-seated insecurity within the literary world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During last week’s Frankfurt Book Fair—the largest of its kind globally—industry professionals expressed their concerns and sought answers to pressing questions. What happens to an author’s intellectual property in the age of AI? Who owns the rights to AI-generated content? How can this new form of content creation be integrated into existing value chains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of AI in the realm of writing is undeniable. With tools like ChatGPT, aspiring authors can now produce novels in a matter of days—a task that would traditionally take months, if not years. Amazon’s e-book self-publishing unit has seen a surge in titles listing ChatGPT as a co-author, although critics argue that the quality of these works leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent British author Salman Rushdie, during a rare public appearance since his near-fatal stabbing attack last year, shared his experience with AI writing tools. When asked to produce 300 words in Rushdie’s style, the result was “pure garbage,” he remarked, drawing laughter from the audience. “Anybody who has ever read 300 words of mine would immediately recognize that it could not possibly be by me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, some see potential in AI’s role in writing. German author and academic Jennifer Becker pointed out during a panel discussion that while AI-generated fiction is “still not that great,” there is room for collaborative use between humans and AI, although she does not foresee a future where AI autonomously takes over the writing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal challenges are also on the horizon, as the industry tries to navigate the “grey area” of copyright ownership for AI-generated content. Last month, renowned authors including George RR Martin and Jodi Picoult filed a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing the company of copyright violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the lines between human and computer-generated content blurring, efforts are being made to establish clearer guidelines. Amazon, for instance, now requires authors to disclose if their work includes AI-generated material when selling books through its self-publishing unit.&lt;/p&gt;

The show, initially bathed in a flood of media attention, promised to bring Stewart’s characteristic wit and bold commentary back to the screen. Yet, the viewership did not meet expectations, plummeting to as low as 40,000 U.S. homes by the fifth episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the low ratings tell only part of the story. Reports from The New York Times and CNN reveal internal tensions between Stewart and Apple, centering around the handling of sensitive topics such as China, Israel, and artificial intelligence. While Apple granted Stewart creative control, this control was seemingly put to the test as these controversial subjects came into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China stands out as a particularly thorny issue for Apple, a company that garners almost a fifth of its sales from the country and relies heavily on its manufacturing capabilities. Stewart’s inclination to delve into subjects that could ruffle feathers at Apple headquarters marks a divergence from the company’s usual approach to sensitive political topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the rocky journey, “The Problem with Jon Stewart” did enjoy moments of popularity, initially ranking as the No. 1 unscripted series on Apple TV+ during its debut month. Stewart, known for his leftist views, occasionally stepped out of the expected narrative, challenging topics like the Biden family’s business dealings and the censorship surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus lab leak theory. However, these moments of divergence were not enough to sustain the show’s viewership or resolve the internal disputes over show content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the news of the show’s cancellation circulates, it raises questions about creative freedom in the face of corporate interests, the responsibility of platforms hosting political commentary, and the future of bold, unapologetic voices like Stewart’s in the mainstream media. Only time will tell how this cancellation impacts Stewart’s career and the broader landscape of political talk shows, but one thing is clear—the clash between creative integrity and corporate caution remains a central tension in today’s entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The anticipated success story of “The Problem with Jon Stewart” on Apple TV+ took an unexpected turn as the show faces cancellation, not merely due to dwindling viewership, but reportedly stemming from creative clashes between Jon Stewart and Apple executives.

A recent disclosure from the Federal Election Commission reveals a transfer of $75,000 from Sanders’ campaign to the Sanders Institute during the third quarter, following a significant $200,000 contribution earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sanders Institute, established six years ago by Jane Sanders and David Driscoll, Sanders’ wife and stepson respectively, claims to be a think tank with a focus on amplifying progressive voices. Yet, it has raised eyebrows due to its minimal output and the substantial compensation awarded to Driscoll. The financial intertwining of Sanders’ political funds and his family’s nonprofit has led to questions about the legality and ethics of such transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendra Arnold, Executive Director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, highlights the potential issues surrounding these transactions, stating, “The facts present in this case and the family ties involved certainly raise legitimate concern.” She goes on to elaborate that while it’s not inherently illegal to pay salaries for bona fide services at fair market value, if the nonprofit and its executive director are not legitimately earning the money, it could constitute a serious campaign finance violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sanders Institute, which temporarily ceased operations in 2019 to avoid potential impropriety during Sanders’ presidential campaign, has since resumed activities. However, its outputs appear to be minimal, with scarce identifiable achievements and a lack of substantial work product, despite disbursing nearly 40% of its contributions to salaries in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With nearly $717,000 raised in 2021, the institute paid out over $257,000 in wages, including a $152,653 salary to Driscoll. The organization’s projects, such as The Timeline Project and various content creation initiatives, seem to have little to show for the funds invested, raising further questions about the integrity of the financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident is not the first of its kind. In 2021, Sanders’ presidential committee transferred a whopping $350,000 to the institute, accounting for nearly half of the nonprofit’s fundraising that year. With these repeated instances of financial transfers, scrutiny is increasing over Sanders’ use of campaign funds and the ethical considerations of such dealings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2024 elections approach, and with Sanders’ potential involvement, the spotlight on these financial entanglements grows brighter, demanding transparency and accountability. The public, and particularly Sanders’ supporters, deserve clear answers and assurances that campaign funds are being utilized ethically and legally.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Senator Bernie Sanders, representing Vermont, has once again found himself at the center of controversy as he channels substantial sums from his campaign coffers to a nonprofit run by his wife and stepson.

The machinery in question plays a crucial role in China’s push to develop cutting-edge technology, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo underscored the importance of these measures in a recent statement, stating that the updated rules would “increase effectiveness of our controls and further shut off pathways to evade our restrictions.” She emphasized the government’s commitment to restricting access to critical technologies while minimizing unintended impacts on trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this strategic maneuver has not been without its share of controversy and potential pitfalls. Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of AI chips, has publicly stated that the restrictions will halt sales of the H800 and A800, both high-end AI chips designed specifically for the Chinese market. This has raised concerns about the company’s ability to support existing customers and complete product development in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent SEC filing, Nvidia highlighted the potential ramifications of these restrictions, noting that they may necessitate transitioning certain operations out of the impacted regions. The filing underscores the complexity and challenges that chip companies are now facing as a result of the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the sale of deep ultraviolet lithography machines to China is also being restricted. This is a significant development, as Dutch firm ASML dominates the lithography market, and these restrictions will inevitably curb exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set to take effect in 30 days, these measures have elicited strong reactions from various quarters. China has condemned the move, labeling it as “forced de-coupling for political purposes” and calling on the U.S. to stop politicizing trade and technology issues. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the U.S. to cease destabilizing global industrial and supply chains, highlighting the geopolitical tensions underpinning the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the home front, the Semiconductor Industry Association, representing a major portion of the U.S. semiconductor industry, has voiced its concerns. The association argues that the new measures are “overly broad” and risk damaging the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem. They warn that these restrictions may inadvertently push overseas customers to seek alternatives, potentially jeopardizing the industry’s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the Department of Commerce stands firm, asserting that the new restrictions are essential for maintaining control effectiveness, closing loopholes, and ensuring durability.

&lt;p&gt;The victim, a staffer for Senator Katie Britt (R-AL), was accosted on Thursday night, shortly before 8:30 p.m., as she was walking down a sidewalk. A man, brazen and unafraid, approached her, placed a gun in her face, and demanded her purse and keys. Faced with no other option, she handed over her belongings, and the robber swiftly made his escape in her car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the staffer was not physically harmed during the terrifying ordeal. However, the psychological impact of such an event cannot be understated, and it brings to light the severe issues of crime that are currently plaguing Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Katie Britt was quick to respond, expressing relief that her staffer was unharmed but also voicing her frustration and anger at the situation. In her statement, she pointed out the shocking crime rates in the city, with robberies up by 68% and motor vehicle thefts spiking by 102%.

&lt;p&gt;This incident is not an isolated one; it is part of a broader pattern of rising crime in Washington, DC, particularly in areas close to Capitol Hill. Just last month, the House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil (R-WI) felt compelled to issue a warning to staffers, advising them to avoid wearing jewelry and to stay alert, especially when using cell phones in public spaces. This advice was given in an effort to reduce the chances of staffers becoming targets for criminals in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robbery of the Senate staffer serves as a stark reminder that even in areas that should be secure, no one is immune to the threat of crime. It also raises critical questions about the effectiveness of gun control laws in Washington, DC, as the city continues to experience a surge in violent crime despite having strict regulations on firearms.&lt;/p&gt;

The victim, a staffer for Senator Katie Britt (R-AL), was accosted on Thursday night, shortly before 8:30 p.m., as she was walking down a sidewalk. A man, brazen and unafraid, approached her, placed a gun in her face, and demanded her purse and keys. Faced with no other option, she handed over her belongings, and the robber swiftly made his escape in her car. Fortunately, the staffer was not physically harmed during the terrifying ordeal. However, the psychological impact of such an event cannot be understated, and it brings to light the severe issues of crime that are currently plaguing Washington, DC. Senator Katie Britt was quick to respond, expressing relief that her staffer was unharmed but also voicing her frustration and anger at the situation. In her statement, she pointed out the shocking crime rates in the city, with robberies up by 68% and motor vehicle thefts spiking by 102%. She called on local elected officials to take responsibility and to address the crime crisis head-on.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, a prominent figure in the GOP and a frontrunner for the House Speaker position, recently faced a significant shift in his political journey. After three rounds of voting, House Republicans ultimately decided to retract their support, withdrawing Jordan as their nominee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A myriad of factors contributed to this outcome, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of political endorsements and party unity. One of the more pronounced elements in this scenario was the party’s decision to employ a secret ballot, a move that Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania recognizes as a turning point. This process led to 25 Republicans casting their votes for alternative candidates, deviating from Jordan’s camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the complexities, death threats against certain Republicans who did not support Jordan’s nomination became a grave concern. Representatives Marianette Miller-Meeks and Nick LaLota faced harsh backlash for their voting choices, with both receiving threats to their safety. Jordan’s office was quick to condemn these actions, emphasizing their place outside the realm of civil discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s stance on the controversial 2020 Presidential election also came into play, turning into a point of contention within the GOP ranks. This perspective was a significant factor for Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, influencing his decision to withhold support from Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s distinct persona and political approach, marked by polarizing views, may have also contributed to his downfall. His strong and divisive presence possibly alienated moderates within the party, particularly those representing districts won by President Biden in the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of these factors led to a pivotal moment when the House GOP conference convened after the third ballot. The conference resolved to drop Jordan as their nominee for Speaker, a decision finalized behind closed doors. During the final round, 25 Republicans voted against Jordan, leaving him with just 194 votes — a far cry from the approximately 217 required to secure the position, and marking his lowest tally across all three ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s story serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in political nominations, underscoring the importance of unity, clear stances, and the ability to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters and representatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Rep.

This statistic, highlighted by a recent study from the American Security Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, signals potential threats to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by the New York Post, this study assessed the body mass index (BMI) of U.S. troops. Shockingly, 68% of them were found to be in the “overweight” or “obese” categories based on BMI standards. Over the past ten years, the rate of troops falling into the “obese” classification has more than doubled, rocketing from “10.4% in 2012” to a staggering “21.6%” recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Security Project’s report stresses the urgency of addressing this situation. The overarching message: for the longevity, strength, and operability of the armed forces, decisive action must be taken against rising obesity rates within the ranks. This includes upholding strict body composition standards and updating health policies in line with scientifically-backed guidelines. Tackling obesity in the military is not just essential—it’s overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, each military branch maintains its own “minimum body composition standards” for recruits. And, unsurprisingly, obesity remains the leading reason potential recruits are turned away. Further data from the Pentagon amplifies the concern, showing that fewer than 25% of Americans aged 17-24 meet the academic and physical prerequisites to serve. This predicament only deepens the recruitment deficit, an issue brought to the fore when top military officials revealed enlistment shortfalls across the Army, Navy, and Air Force this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing trend in obesity isn’t just a recruitment concern. It’s also linked to in-service injuries and is a dominant reason for medical discharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these findings, the study proposes a renewed focus on BMI in recruitment and retention reports presented to Congress. Through proactive measures and early screening for health issues related to obesity, the military can potentially foster long-term weight loss, improved health outcomes, and even lower healthcare expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study’s revelations dovetail with the American Medical Association’s (AMA) recent reevaluation of BMI’s role. The AMA acknowledges the “historical harm” and inherent biases of BMI calculations, primarily founded on data from non-Hispanic whites. Their current recommendation: BMI should be just one of many metrics to gauge body composition. A more comprehensive approach that integrates measures like visceral fat, waist circumference, and body composition, all while considering genetic and metabolic influences, is the need of the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the military grapples with this weighty issue, the broader question remains: How can America’s defense forces maintain peak physical readiness in the face of such pressing health challenges?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A concerning trend has come to light: nearly 70% of U.S. military personnel are now considered either overweight or obese.

This cutback, ranging from amusement parks to rock concerts and performing arts, is a repercussion of skyrocketing prices, reveals a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Credit Karma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further insights from the survey indicate a worrying trend: around 26% of respondents have stopped spending on live entertainment altogether. This percentage has seen a sharp rise from 16% pre-pandemic. This phenomenon, aptly named “funflation”, signifies that a substantial segment of American families is grappling with President Joe Biden’s economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditures Survey exposed that entertainment admissions and fee costs increased at a more rapid pace than essentials like food and gasoline. To offer some perspective, food-at-home prices surged by a staggering 19.6% since February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney theme parks, a favorite for many, aren’t insulated from these economic headwinds. Julie Gibbs, an Indiana-based university administration worker, shared her personal experience, recounting her past visits to Walt Disney World in Orlando, which were reduced drastically owing to Disney’s escalating prices. Julie and her family are now reorienting their leisure activities to more economical options, a sentiment echoed by many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Disney’s continuous price increases give me the feeling that they’re perpetually demanding more. It’s not a pleasant sensation,” Julie expressed to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “funflation” was recently introduced by Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. She emphasized the skyrocketing prices in her investor note, stating, “Prices for live, experiential activities are spiraling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting this trend, Disney has once again upped the admission charges for its theme parks, with some passes witnessing an increase of up to 21%. The music industry too isn’t spared from this price surge. Concert tickets for big names like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen have become exorbitantly priced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accentuate the dire state of the entertainment world, the Bruce Springsteen fan magazine, Backstreets, announced its closure after 43 years. The soaring ticket prices, reaching up to $5,000, have doused fans’ enthusiasm, the magazine’s publisher remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
