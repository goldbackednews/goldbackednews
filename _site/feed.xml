A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Unrest Unleashed - Philadelphia Grapples with Mass Looting</title><link href="/news/2023/09/28/City-Unrest-Philadelphia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unrest Unleashed - Philadelphia Grapples with Mass Looting" /><published>2023-09-28T10:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T10:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/28/City-Unrest-Philadelphia</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/28/City-Unrest-Philadelphia/">&lt;p&gt;The city of Brotherly Love found itself amidst turmoil and chaos as groups, predominantly consisting of teenagers, orchestrated a series of lootings across various stores in Philadelphia, leaving a trail of destruction and stolen goods behind. This mass looting phenomenon targeted major retail outlets, including an Apple store, Foot Locker, and Lululemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sickening-display-of-opportunism&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sickening Display of Opportunism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia’s Mayor, Jim Kenney, and Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford, have vehemently condemned the acts of coordinated looting that ravaged the city. “This was a sickening display of opportunistic criminal activity, and we will not stand for it,” declared Mayor Kenney, asserting the city’s stance against such destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swift-retaliation-by-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift Retaliation by Law Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rapid response, the Philadelphia Police Department apprehended between 15 to 20 individuals involved in the flash-mob style ransacking of stores, displaying their commitment to maintaining public safety and order. Further investigations are underway, focusing on a possible connection between various vehicles moving from location to location during the looting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-city-in-anguish&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A City in Anguish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coordinated criminal activity sparked immense anger and frustration among city officials and citizens alike. Commissioner Stanford likened the incidents to the widespread protests and civil unrest that occurred in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020. “Everyone in this city should be angry,” emphasized Stanford, underscoring the impact such incidents have on the community and local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinated-criminal-activity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated Criminal Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents were a calculated effort by criminals seeking to exploit a situation, separate from a peaceful protest that took place after the dismissal of charges against a Philadelphia police officer. Videos surfacing on social media displayed masked individuals, armed with hoodies, swiftly entering stores, seizing merchandise, and fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citys-resolve-to-restore-order&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City’s Resolve to Restore Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the unrest and disruption caused by the looting, the city’s resolve remains unbroken. Mayor Kenney extended his gratitude to the Philadelphia Police Department for its rapid and efficient response in dispersing crowds and making arrests related to the night’s incidents. He pledged that such criminal opportunism aimed at destroying the city would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continued-vigilance&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continued Vigilance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Police Department remains vigilant and is actively investigating these incidents to prevent any future occurrences of such disruptive and criminal behavior. “The Philadelphia Police Department is committed to maintaining public safety and order,” the department stated, reflecting the city’s determination to protect its citizens and businesses from the plague of coordinated criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of these looting incidents leaves a city grappling with restoring order and ensuring the safety of its residents, reflecting a broader national discourse on civil unrest and coordinated criminal activity.

Speaking to a diverse crowd in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump criticized Biden’s approach to globalism, reaffirming his commitment to American workers, and “economic nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stand-for-economic-nationalism&quot;&gt;A Stand for Economic Nationalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump addressed his commitment to revitalizing American industries, focusing on automobile manufacturing— a lifeblood of the nation’s economy. He rebuked Biden’s overreliance on foreign batteries and rare-earth mineral mining for electric vehicles. Trump emphasized his commitment to American labor over foreign, stating: “I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empowering-american-workers&quot;&gt;Empowering American Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump communicated directly to a variety of workers including UAW members, assembly line workers, welders, mechanics, and electricians, praising them for their contributions to building the nation. His speech reflected a strong inclination towards sustaining American industry and protecting the interests of American workers. “You built this country. You love this country, and you are the ones that make our country run,” Trump appreciated, calling for a future that raises American wages, fortifies American industry, and builds national pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrasting-visions&quot;&gt;Contrasting Visions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s speech was clearly intended to contrast his vision of economic nationalism against what he perceives as Biden’s pandering to globalist ideals. He accused Biden of hastily planning a trip to Michigan and condemned the apparent preference of foreign profits over the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-assembly-of-blue-collar-workers&quot;&gt;An Assembly of Blue-Collar Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his address, Trump created a sense of unity and camaraderie among blue-collar workers of Michigan. He was not there merely to criticize Biden’s policies but to reassure the American worker and to salute those “who do not get the credit they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vow-to-make-america-great&quot;&gt;A Vow to Make America Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I side with the autoworkers of America and with those who want to make America great again, and I always will,” Trump vowed, underlining his perpetual allegiance to American workers. He dismissed the electric vehicle push by automakers bending to the Biden administration, calling it a threat to jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation&quot;&gt;A Battle for the Soul of the Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the UAW labor bosses allied with Biden, Trump and his campaign persisted in gathering support from various working-class groups, outlining his vision for a resurgence of economic nationalism. The speech underlined a fundamental dispute between globalism and economic nationalism, a battle for the values, dignity, and soul of the nation, resonating with those who feel overlooked and underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Trump’s energetic assembly in Michigan turned out to be more than just a political rally. It was a symphony of shared values and mutual respect, a stand for the working class against the tide of globalism, reinforcing the hope and dignity of countless Americans. His pledge to the American dream and his battle against globalism reflect a deep-rooted concern for the future of American labor and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Former President Donald Trump recently elucidated his stance on defending the American working class, contrasting his viewpoint with President Joe Biden’s policies.

&lt;p&gt;Tension was evident when President Joe Biden made a brief appearance among striking United Auto Workers (UAW) in Michigan. This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photop-session-amid-industrial-action&quot;&gt;Photop Session amid Industrial Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce. The UAW is protesting for wage enhancements amid the “Bidenflation,” concerned about the possible repercussions of Biden’s electric vehicle (EV) initiatives on their employment and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-tale-of-two-engagements&quot;&gt;A Tale of Two Engagements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Biden opted for a quick photo-op, Trump actively engaged with the union members and the autoworkers, underlining their significant role in nation-building. Biden’s seemingly dismissive stance was further spotlighted as he announced his visit only after Trump’s planned engagement was made public, raising questions about the genuineness of Biden’s concern for the striking workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accusations-and-disloyalty&quot;&gt;Accusations and Disloyalty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-visit, Biden quickly transitioned to a high-profile fundraiser, leaving behind accusations of neglecting American labor and selling out jobs, intensifying the perception of his disconnection from the labor sector that is pivotal for the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;

This fleeting visit was met with boos, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction among autoworkers with the administration’s industrial policies and actions. Photop Session amid Industrial Action Biden’s snapshot visit to the picket line highlighted the ongoing discord, with former President Trump emphasizing the detrimental impact of Biden’s policies on Michigan’s industrial workforce. The UAW is protesting for wage enhancements amid the “Bidenflation,” concerned about the possible repercussions of Biden’s electric vehicle (EV) initiatives on their employment and compensation. A Tale of Two Engagements While Biden opted for a quick photo-op, Trump actively engaged with the union members and the autoworkers, underlining their significant role in nation-building. Biden’s seemingly dismissive stance was further spotlighted as he announced his visit only after Trump’s planned engagement was made public, raising questions about the genuineness of Biden’s concern for the striking workforce. Accusations and Disloyalty Post-visit, Biden quickly transitioned to a high-profile fundraiser, leaving behind accusations of neglecting American labor and selling out jobs, intensifying the perception of his disconnection from the labor sector that is pivotal for the American economy.

The unsettling detail here is the listing of Joe Biden’s residential address as the beneficiary address for the transactions, raising eyebrows and fueling suspicions regarding the integrity and transparency of the Biden family’s interactions with foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unraveling-the-chinese-connection&quot;&gt;Unraveling the Chinese Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a revelation on Fox News Channel’s “The Ingraham Angle,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-KY) stated that Hunter Biden used his father’s Wilmington home address for a significant transaction. A businessman from China, identified as Jonathan Lee, with known affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, wired $250,000 to Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Ingraham, the anchor, pointed out that the wire transfer forms notably used Joe Biden’s home address. The intricacy of such a detail makes one ponder the extent and nature of the involvement of the Bidens with Chinese businesses and potentially the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-and-suspicions&quot;&gt;Implications and Suspicions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this revelation are profound and potentially harmful, considering the listed home address is that of the sitting President of the United States. If the accusations hold weight, it could severely tarnish the image of the presidency and lead to concerns over national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Joe Biden’s address as the beneficiary’s address at a time when Hunter was allegedly not residing with his father raises questions. This anomaly necessitates a comprehensive inquiry into the reasons behind such a choice of address and the nature of the transactions and relationships involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-player&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Lee, the man behind the wire, is portrayed as a colossal business personality in China, known for his endeavors in representing Chinese interests in the United States, especially in sectors crucial to national security. This raises concerns about the influence and leverage such entities might have over American industries and, more importantly, over individuals in positions of power, such as the Bidens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bipartisan-concerns-over-china&quot;&gt;Bipartisan Concerns Over China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concerns over China’s growing influence and investment in American industries and farmlands is a mutual worry amongst both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The shared viewpoint emphasizes the need for thorough scrutiny and possible regulations to prevent China’s potential dominance over industries vital to American national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biden-lee-meetup&quot;&gt;The Biden-Lee Meetup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen the concerns, it has been unearthed that Joe Biden had had interactions with Jonathan Lee, adding another layer to the already complex and mysterious relationship between the Bidens and Chinese entities. This interaction raises further questions on the nature and intent behind their relationships and the extent of their engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

The transparency, integrity, and independence of the President’s decisions might be under question, given the intricate web of relationships and financial engagements that are coming to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Duncan attended the school’s family fun night event on September 12, with her daughter who is also a student at the academy. What started as an innocent community gathering soon transformed into a situation none could have anticipated. Two students discovered a stash of methamphetamine in a secret compartment of Duncan’s scrunchie, a revelation that led to immediate and swift actions by school officials and the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security footage from the school showed Duncan wearing the scrunchie earlier in the evening. Duncan’s scrunchie, which seemed unusually heavy, revealed a vial of white powder and a cut straw after being examined by two students. These students were quick to inform another teacher, leading to the scrunchie being secured and higher officials in the school being notified.&lt;/p&gt;

Duncan’s first two samples did not reach the required amount or temperature for testing. During a third attempt, police observed an unauthorized collection container falling from Duncan’s shorts. This spurred more suspicion and intensified the investigation into her activities and behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duncan was arrested and booked into the Vanderburgh County Jail, subsequently being released on $1,000 bond under the condition that she attend a drug rehab program. The school district swiftly responded, firing Duncan the day of her arrest.

The state’s Republican leadership is spearheading discussions on potentially rejecting federal funds in favor of state funds, intending to maintain control and autonomy in how they educate their youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tennessees-independent-stance&quot;&gt;Tennessee’s Independent Stance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s consideration to sever the federal education funding strings is a significant exemplification of a state opting not to be swayed or confined by the federal government’s mandates. It is in line with Tennessee’s established conservative stance, demonstrating its commitment to prioritizing state values and principles in its governance and legislative processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We, as a state, can lead the nation once again in telling the federal government that they can keep their money, and we’ll just do things the Tennessee way,”&lt;/em&gt; remarked Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, illuminating Tennessee’s resolve to uphold its autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-the-impact&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel, called the Joint Working Group, has been constituted to study the impacts and implications of such a move. Comprising members from both the state House and Senate, this group will delve deep into the possibilities and challenges of state funding replacing federal funding for education, offering insights into whether Tennessee can independently sustain its educational endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crux-of-the-matter&quot;&gt;The Crux of the Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s leadership maintains that the education of Tennessee’s youth is paramount and should not be compromised by the strings attached to federal dollars. These federal funds invariably come laden with various mandates and restrictions, affecting the manner in which education is imparted to the children of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Federal dollars and the various mandates and restrictions that come with those dollars affect the way Tennessee’s children are educated,”&lt;/em&gt; opined Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, emphasizing the crucial nature of this potential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opposition&quot;&gt;The Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this revolutionary proposal has faced opposition, particularly from Democrats who argue that rejecting federal funds may result in “harsh consequences.” They contend that these federal funds are crucial as they support a diverse student base, including those with special needs, English language learners, and students from low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tennessee’s contemplation to part ways with federal education funding is a reflection of the state’s desire to carve its path and not be forced into compliance with federal conditions. It stands as a testament to the ongoing tussle between state autonomy and federal influence, with the outcome holding significant implications for the future of education funding and state-federal relations in the United States.

Hollywood, traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats, has seen its financial contributions to the party diminish, putting local campaigns and Biden’s re-election bid under financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blow-to-campaign-projections&quot;&gt;A Blow to Campaign Projections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local campaigns lament the industry for causing them to fall as much as 25% short of projections. Jeffrey Katzenberg, serving as Biden’s campaign co-chair, has strategically sidestepped the Los Angeles fundraising circuit entirely out of respect for striking workers, leaving Biden’s campaign in a precarious financial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the campaign is reportedly still awaiting Biden’s blessing before scheduling him in Southern California. One can’t help but ponder if this is a strategy to avoid addressing the current conundrum or simply a lack of urgency on Biden’s part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tentative-agreements-and-ongoing-strikes&quot;&gt;Tentative Agreements and Ongoing Strikes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Writers Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement, hinting at a possible resolution to the writers’ strike as early as October.

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s support was instrumental in the Biden-Harris ticket success in 2020. Celebrities threw millions at the candidates, painting the town blue. However, with Biden’s popularity plummeting amidst rising inflation and an escalating crisis at the border, Hollywood’s loyalty and financial support appear shaky at best. With the current situation labeled as toxic, the speculation is whether Hollywood stars will publicly support Biden’s campaign again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prolonged-aftermath&quot;&gt;Prolonged Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes continue to pose extensive repercussions for Democrats. As one Southern California Democratic strategist mentions, it was a “massive earthquake with prolonged aftershocks expected for months still.” Biden and the Democrats seem to be caught in a tempest with dwindling support from a crucial sector, raising the question of whether they can navigate through these turbulent times successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
