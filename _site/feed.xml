A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Ramaswamy Sounds Alarm - Biden as the ‘Sacrificial Lamb?’</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/15/Biden-Sacrificial-Lamb/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ramaswamy Sounds Alarm - Biden as the ‘Sacrificial Lamb?’" /><published>2023-09-15T17:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-15T17:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/15/Biden-Sacrificial-Lamb</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/15/Biden-Sacrificial-Lamb/">&lt;p&gt;As the 2024 elections loom, the political landscape appears to be in flux, with GOP hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy making a startling prediction regarding the fate of current President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an engaging discussion on FNC’s “Jesse Watters Primetime”, Ramaswamy posited that Biden, despite being the face of the Democratic Party, might soon be maneuvered “out of the way” by his very own political allies. Lending weight to this assertion, he hinted at a larger play at hand, labeling Biden as a potential “sacrificial lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Watters, noting the fluctuating poll numbers and evident tension within the Democratic camp, probed Ramaswamy for his take. “Joe Biden, not looking so good,” Watters began, “how are things looking to you as a Republican?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramaswamy, never one to mince his words, confidently stated, “I was happy to see that I’m beating Joe Biden in that poll and doing just fine.” However, it was his subsequent remarks that raised eyebrows. Diving into the heart of the matter, he contended, “Joe Biden is a puppet for the managerial class… he’s a figurehead for the deep state and the managerial class.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such statements, while audacious, frame the current state of U.S. politics in a new light. Ramaswamy’s observations suggest that there might be more to Biden’s presidency than what meets the eye. He believes that if Biden’s use reaches its end, the powers that be will merely “trot out the next puppet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer of intrigue, he referred to the recent indictment involving Hunter Biden, calling it a potential “smokescreen” and hinting at its use to edge Joe Biden out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramaswamy’s revelations, if accurate, depict a complicated and evolving political gameboard, with strategies and ploys going well beyond traditional party lines.

Following an incident involving an aggressive, reportedly intoxicated roommate, Izquierdo found herself facing serious legal consequences for defending herself. Her story and the subsequent courtroom drama serve as a powerful testament to the Second Amendment’s enduring importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-birthday-in-jail-to-second-amendment-triumph&quot;&gt;From Birthday in Jail to Second Amendment Triumph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating her birthday behind bars last year was perhaps the least of Izquierdo’s worries. After using her firearm to fend off an allegedly aggressive male roommate in San Bernardino, California, she was arrested. A year on, her case has been dismissed, highlighting the crucial role the Second Amendment played in ensuring her safety from unforeseen dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening in question, Izquierdo had completed household chores and was ready to wind down when the male roommate returned home. She believed he was drunk and was neither in the mood nor felt safe to engage in a conversation with him. What followed was a distressing sequence of events that saw the man persistently approach her, to the point where Izquierdo feared for her safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-turn-of-events&quot;&gt;A Turn of Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izquierdo’s attempts to avoid confrontation proved fruitless. When she tried to shut herself inside a bathroom to elude him, the situation took a frightening turn. The man blocked the door, confirming Izquierdo’s fears that a dangerous confrontation was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, California law permits residents to carry guns on private property without a permit. Equipped with a concealed carry permit and her association with the U.S. Concealed Carry Association, Izquierdo managed to retrieve her gun in the nick of time. Her decisive action kept her safe, but she was arrested and charged following the altercation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-triumph-and-second-amendment-advocacy&quot;&gt;Legal Triumph and Second Amendment Advocacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending nearly three weeks in jail, Izquierdo recalled her membership with the U.S. Concealed Carry Association, which offers self-defense liability insurance. With the help of her legal team, including attorney Andy Beltran, it was demonstrated that she acted in self-defense. The persistent efforts of her defense team, coupled with the backing of the USCCA, led to her eventual exoneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beltran’s advice post the trial was poignant: “Refrain from making any statements to the police even if you think you are in the right.” This case underscores how situations can swiftly turn and the importance of being knowledgeable about one’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further emphasizing the relevance of being prepared, Jake Schmidt from the USCCA mentioned, “Responsible gun owners need to be mentally, physically and legally prepared for a self-defense incident. All USCCA members receive lifesaving education and training, plus self-defense liability insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-immigrants-perspective&quot;&gt;An Immigrant’s Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izquierdo’s experience as an immigrant from Cuba gave her unique insight into the significance of personal freedoms. Coming from a country where individual liberties were curtailed, she expressed gratitude for the rights afforded to her in the U.S. Despite the challenges of her arrest, Izquierdo showcased resilience and tenacity, highlighting, “Being prepared is not just carrying a weapon only… I am very happy that I made the right decision to have these lawyers and to have this [USCCA] insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This landmark case not only affirms the rights of responsible gun owners but also illuminates the broader implications of the Second Amendment in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a recent legal win, Maybi Izquierdo, a female long-haul trucker, reignites the national debate on the Second Amendment and the rights of gun owners.

This follows charges in late July that alleged Trump and two of his employees tried to delete footage from his Florida estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a candid conversation with “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, Trump categorically labeled the allegations against him as “false”. Emphasizing his point, when quizzed about his willingness to testify under oath, Trump didn’t flinch, asserting, “Sure, I’m going to — I’ll testify.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant revelation from Trump highlighted that the tapes in question were never deleted. “But more importantly, the tapes weren’t deleted. In other words, there was nothing done to them. And they were my tapes. I could have fought them. I didn’t even have to give them the tapes, I don’t think,” Trump emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet, and Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance supervisor at Mar-a-Lago, have both been charged with obstruction, Trump has consistently maintained a clean slate.

Greenberg, who was discovered with an alarming 20 stab wounds, was ruled to have committed suicide, a conclusion that has drawn significant skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-bizarre-crime-scene&quot;&gt;A Bizarre Crime Scene&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellen was found in her apartment with a knife lodged in her chest, amidst a chilling January blizzard. Appellate court documents now disclose that her apartment was cleaned before the police, bearing a search warrant, arrived on the scene. An astounding revelation, considering the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scrutiny-on-authorities&quot;&gt;Scrutiny on Authorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judiciary hasn’t turned a blind eye to the situation. In a recent ruling, judges voiced strong concerns over the investigative processes followed by the city police, prosecutors, and the medical examiner’s office. Commonwealth Judge Ellen Ceisler penned, “The facts surrounding this matter are extremely disturbing… The experts they enlisted have all raised serious factual questions…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the evidence pointing to possible foul play, the ruling maintains Greenberg’s death as a suicide. This has left many, including Joe Podraza, the attorney for Ellen’s parents, utterly flabbergasted. “The majority opinion is a road map on how to commit murder and to not be held accountable,” Podraza commented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the maze of complexities, critical evidence from the scene seems to have been removed prior to official investigations. Ellen’s purse, three laptops, and two cellphones were reportedly taken from the apartment by her fiancé’s uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With external voices screaming foul play, the Chester County District Attorney’s Office is currently re-evaluating the circumstances of Greenberg’s demise. The family is resolute in their conviction that their daughter was a victim of foul play, and they are pushing for a separate civil lawsuit alleging evidence cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;

While the city of Philadelphia has expressed sympathy for the Greenberg family’s plight, the true course of justice remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Joe Podraza, emphasizing the need for a new investigation: “The fact that we have presented that magnitude of evidence… cries out for further investigation and plainly undermines a determination of suicide.”&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside her husband, &lt;strong&gt;Derick Dillard&lt;/strong&gt;, Duggar has penned a memoir titled “Counting the Cost,” wherein she delves into the intricate balance of maintaining familial ties while stepping out of the shadows of a life dominated by the TV lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-reality-star-to-empowered-individual&quot;&gt;From Reality Star to Empowered Individual&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jill’s trajectory from the confines of her reality TV fame to where she stands today - on the edge of Arkansas and Oklahoma, cherishing the joys of motherhood to three boys - is nothing short of transformative. Sporting a nose ring, wearing pants, and embracing therapy, Jill exudes the aura of someone who has finally broken free from the shackles that once bound her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her memoir, which recently hit the bookshelves, serves not just as a tell-all but more importantly as a cathartic release. “It’s helped us process and disentangle our feelings,” Jill mentions. Reflecting on the broader implications of her story, she hopes it resonates with many, underscoring that the feelings of isolation stemming from control aren’t isolated to her life or the world of reality TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delving-into-deep-waters&quot;&gt;Delving Into Deep Waters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the glitter and glamour of the reality show realm lay the dark undercurrents of Jill’s relationship with her family, especially her father, &lt;strong&gt;Jim Bob Duggar&lt;/strong&gt;. Accusations fly high with claims of weaponizing her marriage and prioritizing the protection of her controversial brother, &lt;strong&gt;Josh Duggar&lt;/strong&gt;, over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Counting the Cost” boldly brings to light the estrangement with her father, hinting at a bond now filled with “hornets and garter snakes.” While the future remains uncertain, Jill remains hopeful, expressing, “I hope and pray that it does get better. I love my dad… I love my family so much. And I don’t want to hurt them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walking-away---no-regrets&quot;&gt;Walking Away - No Regrets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to step away from the TV lens in 2017 wasn’t an easy one, yet Jill and Derick, looking back, have no second thoughts. Despite the love for their family, their need for autonomy and control over their narrative pushed them to make this monumental decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wanted us to have more control of our lives,” states Jill, reflecting on the liberating sensation of being free from the reality show grind. The fears of detachment from the family loomed large, but the desire for a genuine life far from the cameras outweighed it all.&lt;/p&gt;

This decision comes after lawyers Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro expressed their intentions for an expedited trial, initially set for October 23. Trump and several other co-defendants had communicated their preference for a separate trial timeline, emphasizing the significance of thorough readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Fani Willis had initially pushed for a collective trial for all 19 defendants. However, given various factors including tight timetables, Judge McAfee decided to separate Trump and the majority of the defendants from Powell and Chesebro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McAfee’s declaration noted, “The precarious ability of the Court to ensure adequate pretrial preparation on the current accelerated track weighs heavily in favor of severance.” He further mentioned the possibility of further dividing the defendants into smaller groups for trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfolding of this decision has implications for other defendants. Several are keen on not being associated with Sidney Powell, who has been prominent in pushing certain narratives regarding the election. Rudy Giuliani, former New York City Mayor, has been vocal in distinguishing his views from Powell’s. Similarly, Trump-aligned lawyer Eric Herschmann had previously voiced skepticism regarding Powell’s assertions related to the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core issues of the case are diverse. Chesebro is implicated in a strategy to have 16 Georgia Republicans endorse Trump’s electoral victory, while Powell faces accusations related to an election equipment breach in Coffee County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Judge McAfee highlighted the logistical challenges of conducting the trial, given the limitations of the Fulton County courthouse in accommodating all defendants, their legal teams, and necessary personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

As the world absorbs the details of the accusations, Roiland has been quick to deny the claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-praise-to-prosecution&quot;&gt;From Praise to Prosecution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrated for his contribution to the world of animation, Roiland’s public image is being overshadowed by a wave of accusations, including sexual assault and inappropriate interactions with underage fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, he faced charges of felony domestic violence against an ex-girlfriend, which were eventually dismissed due to a lack of evidence. However, the repercussions were palpable, with the acclaimed animator being shown the door from ‘Rick and Morty’, the very show that cemented his status in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-than-just-words&quot;&gt;More Than Just Words?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recently published NBC News report has further ignited the controversy. Based on testimonies from 11 individuals, including women and gender “nonbinary” persons, the report sheds light on the alleged inappropriate conversations Roiland engaged in over various platforms from 2013 to 2022. A disturbing pattern emerges, with three interviewees claiming they were just 16 when the exchanges took a sexual turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly harrowing account from a woman suggests that after a Tinder interaction in 2019, Roiland, despite being aware of her age, bought her alcohol and later attempted to force her into a sexual act. Although Roiland has labeled these allegations as “false and defamatory”, the testimonies continue to mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-traces&quot;&gt;Digital Traces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBC report provides evidence in the form of text messages that appear to display a lack of awareness or remorse on Roiland’s part. Disturbingly, he even used the term “jailbait” in reference to 16-year-olds, making light of their age and making suggestive comments about their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contested-accounts-and-clouded-memories&quot;&gt;Contested Accounts and Clouded Memories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further accounts detail a troubling encounter in Los Angeles involving Roiland, another woman, and a hot tub. Memories of this incident are patchy, but the implications remain deeply unsettling. In defense, Roiland’s attorney has presented a narrative suggesting consensual relations, attempting to distance the animator from any blame regarding the subsequent events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-shattered-image&quot;&gt;A Shattered Image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revelations surrounding Justin Roiland have sent shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry, prompting discussions about power dynamics, consent, and the responsibility of public figures.

With the potential for a sentence reaching up to 25 years in prison, the consequences are significant. This comes amid an already shaky political climate where President Biden himself is under the magnifying glass due to a formal impeachment inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Counts, One Impending Storm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s indictment is not simple. It encompasses three criminal counts, each carrying its own weight of potential penalties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm. If convicted, this alone could see Hunter facing up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A deceptive statement related to records essential for a federal firearms dealer. Conviction here could culminate in a five-year prison term, another $250,000 fine, and an additional three years under supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances. This count can land him another decade in prison, with an equivalent fine and supervision period as the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aggregated, the potential consequences are daunting: a quarter of a century behind bars and fines totaling $750,000. Overseeing this intricate case is Special Counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Deals and a Father Under Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indictment follows Hunter’s plea agreement’s collapse earlier this year. Back in July, Hunter was on track to plead guilty to two misdemeanors related to tax evasion in a bid to eschew incarceration on a more serious gun-related felony charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as Hunter’s legal woes continue to unravel, President Biden isn’t immune to scrutiny. A formal impeachment inquiry is underway, spurred by “serious and credible allegations into President Biden’s conduct,” as articulated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden’s Lawyer Strikes Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these charges, Hunter’s legal counsel, Abbe Lowell, retaliated, condemning the “MAGA Republicans’ improper and partisan interference in this process”. He suggested that the charges lodged, which the prosecutors deemed unwarranted merely six weeks ago, stem from a politically-driven shift rather than a genuine pursuit of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell maintains that Hunter, who held an unloaded gun for less than two weeks, was no threat to public safety. In contrast, he posits that a prosecutor succumbing to political pressures endangers the very fabric of the justice system. Leveraging an earlier agreement with the prosecutors and recent federal court rulings, Lowell is confident of demonstrating Hunter’s innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Looming Shadow on the Biden Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the President contends with the whispers of impeachment and his son faces these grave charges, one thing becomes clear: the Biden legacy is under significant threat. With the nation watching intently, how this drama unfolds could shape the course of American politics for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden family finds itself in turbulent waters again as Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, stands indicted on federal firearm charges.
