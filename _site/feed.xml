A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">The Last Serenades - Jimmy Buffett’s Unheard Melodies Surface</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/09/Last-Songs-From-Buffett/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Last Serenades - Jimmy Buffett’s Unheard Melodies Surface" /><published>2023-09-09T15:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-09T15:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/09/Last-Songs-From-Buffett</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/09/Last-Songs-From-Buffett/">&lt;p&gt;In an ethereal farewell, the world received the parting gift of three fresh tracks from the legendary Jimmy Buffett, just a week after his passing at 76. Best known for the enduring classic “Margaritaville”, Buffett’s posthumous release promises to solidify his legacy in the annals of soft rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an official statement, Buffett spent his last moments “surrounded by his family, friends, music, and dogs,” symbolizing a life truly lived on his own terms. He has left behind an ocean of fans, whose tributes flow in from all corners, commending not just his musical prowess but his environmental activism, entrepreneurial ventures, and genuine warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eager listeners got a taste of what’s to come on his forthcoming album, “Equal Strain on All Parts,” due for release this November. Three distinct tracks set the tone - “Like My Dog,” “My Gummie Just Kicked In,” and “Bubbles Up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Like My Dog” is Buffett’s ode to canine companionship, reminiscent of Billy Currington’s 2010 hit. It’s a tale of longing – for an unconditional love like that of a faithful pet. Just days before his demise, Buffett teased this song on TikTok, accompanying it with snippets of his cherished moments with his furry friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track “My Gummie Just Kicked In” is exactly what you’d expect from Buffett. Described by Vulture’s Rebecca Alter as a “silly stoner surf-rock track”, it captures a light-hearted adventure of someone experiencing the dizzying effects of an edible gummy at a beach festivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the true gem among the trio seems to be “Bubbles Up,” an embodiment of Buffett’s iconic tropical ballad flair. Stemming from scuba diving’s golden rule to follow the air bubbles to safety, this track metamorphoses that lesson into a life mantra. When lost or overwhelmed, just follow your guiding ‘bubbles’ to find clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a touching tribute, former Beatle Paul McCartney reminisced about their time together and specifically praised “Bubbles Up”, stating, “the vocal was probably the best I’ve heard him sing ever.” The fact that McCartney contributed his bass talents to “My Gummie Just Kicked In” is the cherry on top of this bittersweet sundae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mourn the loss of this unparalleled artist, these posthumous tracks serve as a testament to his indomitable spirit. Though Jimmy Buffett has set sail from this world, his music ensures that he’ll forever remain in the heart of Margaritaville.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In an ethereal farewell, the world received the parting gift of three fresh tracks from the legendary Jimmy Buffett, just a week after his passing at 76.

&lt;p&gt;Speaking before an electrified crowd at the Monumental Leaders rally, Trump laid bare the chilling fact: “If you took the five worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done in a few short years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics can often be cold and detached, but not when they reveal a nation’s rapid economic decline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A cumulative inflation nearing 20%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A dollar that’s lost over 20% of its value in a mere three years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A staggering $11.5 trillion in wasteful spending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A budget deficit set to more than DOUBLE in a year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ten consecutive months of contracting manufacturing and consistently gloomy jobs reports for 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A pitiful 2.1 million new jobs in Biden’s first 30 months compared to Trump’s booming 4.9 million in the same timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family incomes plummeting by $7,400 under Biden’s watch, while they had increased by over $6,000 during Trump’s era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump rightly sounded the alarm, cautioning that the country is on the precipice of a great depression, and the time ticking down on Biden’s clock may determine when the country tips over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fervent rebuke, Trump labeled Biden as “an economic arsonist”, burning away America’s wealth with catastrophic policies. “The choice in this election is between a Biden Economic Bust or a Trump Economic Boom,” Trump stated emphatically. He didn’t shy away from pointing out Biden’s apparent self-serving motives, juxtaposing it with his commitment to the prosperity of American families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rally neared its close, Trump presented a stark choice to the American people. One where the Bidens potentially profit off international dealings while everyday Americans watch their savings vaporize or a vision where the American Dream is not just alive but thriving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s visit to South Dakota is particularly poignant, marking his return to the state since his pivotal Mount Rushmore speech in 2020. Notably, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a staunch Trump supporter, attended the rally, further cementing her endorsement of his presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent revelation from Barbara Eden, the “I Dream of Jeannie” star, highlights one such behind-the-scenes tidbit involving none other than the king of rock ‘n’ roll, Elvis Presley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-unexpected-counselor&quot;&gt;An Unexpected Counselor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the filming of the 1960 movie “Flaming Star”, Presley found himself struggling with a personal dilemma. He was deeply in love with a young woman overseas and had concerns about bringing her to the limelight of Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Elvis] told me about this girl he was very fond of,” Eden, who recently celebrated her 92nd birthday, shared. “He was curious about how my husband and I navigated the challenges of Hollywood as a couple.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unaware, Eden was married to actor Michael Ansara at the time, and their relationship was thriving amidst the trials of Tinseltown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I advised him that as long as you see yourselves as a team, everything will work out,” Eden mentioned. Elvis, however, had his reservations, often echoing, “I just don’t know.” And who was this mysterious girl? The world soon came to know her as Priscilla Presley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-just-a-king-but-a-gentleman&quot;&gt;Not Just A King, But A Gentleman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he was revered for his musical prowess and commanding stage presence, Presley left a lasting impression on Eden as a kind-hearted and well-mannered gentleman. She reminisced about his courteous gestures, such as pulling out a chair for her – a rarity in the world of acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a chuckle, Eden recalled, “He’d bring along his father and another man, whom he referred to as his ‘cousin’. They’d just sit together, strumming their guitars and singing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to the topic of Priscilla, Presley had met the young beauty while stationed in Germany with the Army. The age difference and circumstances raised eyebrows, but their love story became a topic of much discussion and admiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-legacy-beyond-jeannies-bottle&quot;&gt;A Legacy Beyond Jeannie’s Bottle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Presley’s and Eden’s paths crossed briefly, Eden’s own journey in Hollywood was nothing short of legendary. Her iconic role as the whimsical and loveable genie propelled her to stardom. However, her casting was anything but conventional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I never imagined they’d cast a short blonde like me for the role,” Eden laughed. But after a simple tea meeting with the show creator, Sidney Sheldon, the rest became history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her character and the show itself were groundbreaking, Eden revealed that the most buzzed-about topic was her concealed navel! NBC executives were insistent on keeping her midriff modestly hidden, sparking endless speculation and intrigue among fans and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-life-well-lived&quot;&gt;A Life Well Lived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Eden remains active and is looking forward to her appearances at upcoming conventions and the release of her new children’s book. Her secret to staying fit? A rigorous routine involving cycling and weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She concludes with a smile, “I’m blessed with a wonderful family and amazing fans. ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ was a joyful journey, and I’m grateful for every moment of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

The inconsistency in indictments is not just eyebrow-raising but also an affront to any reasonable sense of fairness and impartiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO of Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group, Devin Nunes, raises valid concerns. Out of the 39 Republicans initially poised for indictment, why were only 19 actually charged? The arithmetic doesn’t add up and indeed begs the question Nunes posed on “The Chris Salcedo Show”: “That just makes no sense. It just leads to more questions and answers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole charade turns even more baffling when we find out that some heavy hitters, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, the then-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, were among the names originally slated for indictment. If such a key figure can be in the crosshairs and then suddenly be off the hook, how are we to trust the very premise of these accusations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devin Nunes’ clarion call for Governor Brian Kemp to step up and address this glaring anomaly is more than justified. Kemp’s past disagreements with Trump notwithstanding, this situation transcends personal conflicts and ventures into the realm of safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press’s revelation that the grand jury was overwhelmingly in favor of indicting an additional 20 Republicans adds another layer of intrigue. Why did District Attorney Fani Willis backpedal? Was it truly due to a lack of evidence, or were other opaque factors at play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nunes succinctly summarizes the predicament: “You just had 20 people who walked away innocent, scot-free … in a normal working system, nearly all of those people should have been indicted, or they all should not have been indicted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of Georgia stands at a critical juncture. It can either choose to further mire itself in controversial, questionable legal maneuvers or rise above partisan pettiness and ensure a fair and transparent judicial process.&lt;/p&gt;

In the last year alone, their stock has taken a nosedive, dropping by a whopping 27 percent. And if we turn back the pages to the days before the pandemic, Disney shares are down an astonishing 60.1 percent since their March 2021 high. What’s behind this free fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many factors can be attributed to a company’s decline, there’s a growing sentiment, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Disney’s evident “woke” approach is driving away its core audience. Being “woke,” in other words, pushing for a more politically correct and inclusive narrative, might sound noble to some. But is it commercially viable for a company that has historically thrived on traditional values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney’s decision to champion the radical LGBTQ agenda is a case in point. They haven’t just integrated this into their entertainment content but have also been vocal about it in the political sphere. Their feud with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis (R), over this issue is testimony to their unabashed political stand. While the debate on LGBTQ rights is a broader one, should a children’s entertainment company be the one leading the charge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another red flag has been the allegations and lawsuits against Disney. They stand accused of misleading investors about Disney+’s financial health. For a company that’s been a household name, such claims do a number on investor trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the woke politics. The shift to streaming, which most saw as the next frontier for entertainment, has also not panned out for Disney as they’d hoped. They’ve invested heavily, but with a string of box-office flops and consistent streaming losses, it’s clear that they might have missed the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Bob Iger’s apparent plans to offload many of Disney’s TV properties further show the turmoil within. With traditional cable TV no longer as profitable, thanks to many opting out, the company seems to be in a mad scramble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the MAGA folks, this could be a warning bell for other corporations. The message? Stick to what you’re good at and be wary of adopting every trending political agenda. After all, as Disney’s tumble shows, even giants can falter when they lose sight of their core audience and values.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Disney, a name that once stood for family-friendly content and a whole lot of magic, seems to be facing its own kind of enchantment gone wrong.

And if we turn back the pages to the days before the pandemic, Disney shares are down an astonishing 60.1 percent since their March 2021 high. What’s behind this free fall? While many factors can be attributed to a company’s decline, there’s a growing sentiment, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Disney’s evident “woke” approach is driving away its core audience. Being “woke,” in other words, pushing for a more politically correct and inclusive narrative, might sound noble to some. But is it commercially viable for a company that has historically thrived on traditional values? Disney’s decision to champion the radical LGBTQ agenda is a case in point. They haven’t just integrated this into their entertainment content but have also been vocal about it in the political sphere. Their feud with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis (R), over this issue is testimony to their unabashed political stand. While the debate on LGBTQ rights is a broader one, should a children’s entertainment company be the one leading the charge? Another red flag has been the allegations and lawsuits against Disney. They stand accused of misleading investors about Disney+’s financial health. For a company that’s been a household name, such claims do a number on investor trust. But it’s not just the woke politics. The shift to streaming, which most saw as the next frontier for entertainment, has also not panned out for Disney as they’d hoped. They’ve invested heavily, but with a string of box-office flops and consistent streaming losses, it’s clear that they might have missed the mark. CEO Bob Iger’s apparent plans to offload many of Disney’s TV properties further show the turmoil within. With traditional cable TV no longer as profitable, thanks to many opting out, the company seems to be in a mad scramble. For the MAGA folks, this could be a warning bell for other corporations. The message? Stick to what you’re good at and be wary of adopting every trending political agenda. After all, as Disney’s tumble shows, even giants can falter when they lose sight of their core audience and values.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Privacy Breach on American Airlines - Hidden Camera Found Onboard!</title><link href="/news/2023/09/09/Hidden-Camera-American-Airlines/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Privacy Breach on American Airlines - Hidden Camera Found Onboard!" /><published>2023-09-09T10:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-09T10:03:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/09/Hidden-Camera-American-Airlines</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/09/Hidden-Camera-American-Airlines/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Flight to Remember for All the Wrong Reasons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passengers aboard an American Airlines flight were left in shock and disbelief when a hidden camera was allegedly discovered in the plane’s bathroom. The incident, which is now under investigation by the FBI, further adds to the growing concerns surrounding privacy and safety in air travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details of the Disturbing Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 2nd, an American Airlines flight, originating from Charlotte, N.C., landed at Boston Logan International Airport where a series of peculiar events unraveled. Massachusetts state police confirmed that a “potential criminal act” had taken place during the flight. Without divulging intricate details, the authorities mentioned the involvement of a “juvenile, a flight attendant, and a cell phone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the incident itself occurred in mid-air, the jurisdiction falls under federal law due to the nature of the crime and the location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Passenger’s Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interaction with Fox affiliate Boston 25, a passenger on the ill-fated flight recounted a peculiar interaction between a teenage girl and a male flight attendant. The girl, intending to use the first-class section restroom, was momentarily halted by the attendant, who proceeded to enter the restroom under the pretext of washing his hands. Once he exited, the girl accessed the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickened when the girl’s mother, upon discovering something amiss in the bathroom, halted another passenger from entering. She shared the unsettling information that a camera had been placed inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culmination and Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the plane’s landing, the situation escalated when law enforcement boarded the flight. After a thorough check of the restroom by multiple individuals, the male flight attendant, previously involved in the earlier interaction, was escorted off the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airline industry, which has been striving to rebuild trust and ensure safety post the pandemic, now has another challenge on its hands – ensuring the privacy of its passengers. As the FBI digs deeper into the investigation, passengers and the public eagerly await more information on this alarming breach of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A Flight to Remember for All the Wrong Reasons Passengers aboard an American Airlines flight were left in shock and disbelief when a hidden camera was allegedly discovered in the plane’s bathroom.

The United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in its groundbreaking decision, has implied that President Biden and his team might have dangerously trampled upon the sacred First Amendment rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about governance; it’s about the very essence of our democracy. The court has pointed out how key figures in the administration, including those at the very top in the White House, the Surgeon General’s office, CDC, and even the FBI, seem to have used their positions to unduly and coercively influence online content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel didn’t mince words: “We find that the White House, acting in concert with the Surgeon General’s office, likely coerced the platforms to make their moderation decisions … and significantly encouraged the platforms’ decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI, long considered an impartial agency, was also not spared. The panel suggested that the FBI went far beyond its mandate, not only influencing platforms but also proactively inducing changes to moderation policies. Actions that, many argue, reek of constitutional infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the original lower court injunction was wide in its scope, the revised order now specifically targets and holds accountable these entities: the White House, Surgeon General’s office, CDC, and FBI. It’s a move that many see as the Fifth Circuit stepping up to defend the Constitution from executive overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Eric Schmitt didn’t hold back in his response, labeling the decision a “massive victory for free speech.” In a rallying cry to all freedom-loving Americans, he emphasized, “Because of Missouri v. Biden, the federal government is prohibited yet again from colluding with social media giants to censor freedom of speech online.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Biden administration scrambles to respond, their attempt at defense seems weak at best. While they review the decision and weigh their options, one thing is clear: the American people are watching. With the potential for this case to be elevated to the Supreme Court, it serves as a grim reminder of the need for vigilance in defending our freedoms against potential governmental overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nation that champions liberty and freedom of speech, one must wonder: How did we get here, and how do we ensure our rights remain unassailable?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a country built on the ideals of freedom and individual rights, the Biden administration’s latest act of perceived overreach has many conservatives sounding the alarm.

&lt;p&gt;Quoting Teddy Roosevelt’s renowned “Citizenship in a Republic” speech, Noem said, “It is my honor to present to you the man in the arena. He is a man of significance. He is the leader, the fighter that our country needs. He has my full and complete endorsement for president of the United States of America. I will do everything I can to help him win and save this country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation had been rife leading up to the rally about Noem’s endorsement and Trump’s appearance, with many considering Noem as a possible vice-presidential candidate if Trump secures the nomination. Addressing the rally, Noem acknowledged the buzz, revealing that she had been inundated with queries about the night’s event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the dedication of the former President, Noem described how, while many other presidential hopefuls declined invitations to attend the rally, Trump immediately pledged his attendance. She praised Trump’s dedication to Americans, stressing that “he shows up for every American and fights for us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the critical issues Noem brought to the forefront was the situation at the U.S. Southern border. She praised Trump’s actions during his term, emphasizing his strategy of “peace through strength” and portraying him as the only trustworthy candidate concerning these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks prepared for the event, the former President expressed his gratitude towards Noem, calling her “one of the most successful governors in the entire nation.” Trump lauded Noem’s stance on American values and her tough position on China, while also highlighting her decision to keep South Dakota open during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this significant endorsement, Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidential race gains even more momentum, backed by a prominent Republican figure.

&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from the couple’s attorney, Jay Surgent, “Todd and Julie Chrisley have been model incarcerated individuals and have been compliant with all regulations promulgated by the bureau of prisons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the revision, Todd faced 12 years, while Julie was to serve seven after their 2019 indictment on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. This announcement comes just months after the pair’s entry into prison on January 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for the Chrisleys. Todd’s claims of prison mistreatment due to his celebrity status, and even reports of hazardous living conditions like mold, snakes, and temperature extremes have surfaced. Their children, Savannah and Chase Chrisley, expressed concerns over the “inhumane treatment” their parents faced, detailing the troubling conditions during an episode of the “Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley” podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges and controversies surrounding the Chrisleys, their legacy in the entertainment world remains intact. Their breakthrough show, “Chrisley Knows Best,” may have signed off in March, but the Chrisley saga continues. A new reality show focusing on the lives of Todd and Julie’s children in the aftermath of their parents’ prison sentences is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
