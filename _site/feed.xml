A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/11/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-11-10T09:14:08-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-10T09:14:08-05:00</updated><id>/2023/11/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/11/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Outrage as Biden Officials Extend Unprecedented Access to CCP Leaders</title><link href="/politics/2023/11/10/CCP-Invitation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Outrage as Biden Officials Extend Unprecedented Access to CCP Leaders" /><published>2023-11-10T08:24:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-10T08:24:00-05:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/11/10/CCP-Invitation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/11/10/CCP-Invitation/">&lt;p&gt;In a move that has sparked fierce backlash from conservative quarters, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has come under fire for extending an invitation to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders to tour a highly sensitive U.S. nuclear testing site. The decision, which has led to Republicans sounding the alarm over national security, is seen as yet another questionable call from an administration already facing criticism for its handling of foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nevada National Security Site, a cornerstone in maintaining America’s nuclear deterrence, has historically been shrouded in secrecy due to the sensitive nature of the work conducted within its confines. However, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) recent invitation to foreign powers, particularly the CCP, has raised questions about the Biden administration’s judgment when it comes to safeguarding the nation’s security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, alongside a coalition of 18 House Republicans, has taken a stand, penning a letter to Granholm demanding answers. The Republicans’ letter highlights the inappropriateness of offering China and Russia such “unprecedented access” and expresses concerns over the potential for foreign adversaries to glean insights into the U.S.’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversy stems from a Bloomberg report that revealed the DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration’s invitations to the Nevada site were intended to demonstrate the U.S.’s commitment to a moratorium against nuclear weapons testing. Yet, GOP leaders argue this gesture compromises the integrity of U.S. defenses and sends a signal of weakness at a time when geopolitical tensions are at a boiling point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest episode is another notch in what critics of the Biden administration view as a series of missteps in foreign policy, particularly regarding relations with China and Russia. With China’s nuclear capabilities rapidly expanding and Russia’s increasing assertiveness on the global stage, the wisdom of allowing potential rivals such access is being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House Republicans’ letter does not mince words, warning that such actions could “lead to our own destruction” and potentially embolden China’s refusal to halt its nuclear development. Representatives like Doug Lamborn and Rob Wittman have echoed these sentiments, suggesting that the DOE’s actions are not only alarming but “fundamentally absurd.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOP’s outcry has not only reverberated through the halls of Congress but has also garnered attention from citizens concerned about national security. As the Biden administration continues to navigate complex international waters, decisions like this one will undoubtedly remain under the microscope, with conservative voices holding them to account.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a move that has sparked fierce backlash from conservative quarters, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has come under fire for extending an invitation to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders to tour a highly sensitive U.S. nuclear testing site.

Jeffrey Katzenberg, a former titan of the Hollywood industry, forecasts that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate 90% of animation roles within a mere three years, marking a tectonic shift in the creative landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a recent panel discussion, Katzenberg, known for his influential roles in big studios, shared his insights on the imminent impact of AI on media, entertainment, and content creation. He emphasized the drastic reduction in the workforce and time required to produce animated features, which historically involved hundreds of artists and multiple years of painstaking work. The future, he suggests, will see AI-driven processes streamline this to a fraction of the current input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prediction speaks volumes about the ongoing digital transformation in the entertainment industry, with AI poised to accelerate changes tenfold. The traditional cost of animation, often reaching the hundreds of millions due to labor-intensive processes, is set to plummet as AI algorithms learn to animate with minimal human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the integration of AI in animation could result in more efficient production pipelines and potentially lower costs for consumers, the looming job cuts present a sobering reality. Animators, many of whom may lean towards progressive ideologies, are faced with a future that mirrors the past struggles of blue-collar workers who watched automation reshape manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is not lost on those who recall the lack of empathy for manual labor jobs lost to machines, as now the same sword of technological advancement hangs over the heads of those in creative sectors. Nonetheless, the potential reduction in ‘woke’ influence on animation content, often attributed to pressure from within the industry’s workforce, could mark a return to less politicized family entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the animation community braces for this impending wave of AI, there may be a silver lining. The skill set of animators, often inclusive of coding and digital expertise, could provide a safety net, allowing them to pivot to emerging roles within the tech-driven landscape of entertainment production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI in animation is not just a tale of job loss but also a narrative of adaptation and the inevitable march of progress. As AI transforms how stories are brought to life on screen, the industry must prepare for a new era where creativity meets cutting-edge technology, bringing forth both challenges and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The world of animation is on the brink of a technological upheaval that could render a vast majority of traditional jobs obsolete.

This bold move came as a direct answer to a series of hostile actions targeting U.S. personnel in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enduring no less than 46 attacks since mid-October, with one resulting in a tragic contractor fatality and several causing injuries among U.S. troops, the Department of Defense authorized two F-15 fighter jets to strike the Maysulun weapons storage facility in eastern Syria. This decisive action was a clear message from the U.S.: the protection of American forces is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reaffirmed this stance, emphasizing that the United States will not hesitate to defend its personnel, its interests, and its integrity against any threats. The facility, identified as a hub for Iranian-backed operations, was neutralized under the direct orders of the President, showcasing the administration’s unwavering commitment to the safety of its military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footage of the operation captured the precise moment of impact, followed by secondary explosions, signaling a successful hit on the intended target. The operation’s success is attributed to the vigilance and preparedness of U.S. and coalition defenses, which have been instrumental in disrupting the majority of attempted attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the formidable defenses in place, the recent assault that caused the death of an American contractor and left 56 U.S. troops with injuries, including 25 with traumatic brain injuries, marked a turning point. All injured service members have since returned to duty, but the attacks’ escalation prompted a robust response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh pointed out that the attacks, originating from drones and rockets, have targeted U.S. and coalition forces stationed at strategic sites in Iraq and Syria. The spike in violence is tied to the ongoing tensions between Israel and Hamas, with the U.S. openly supporting Israel’s right to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. stands ready to take further measures to ensure the security of its forces, the message to Iran and its proxies is unmistakable: aggression against U.S. personnel will be met with uncompromising force. The U.S. has made it clear that while it does not seek conflict, it will not stand by as its troops come under fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent airstrike not only served as a necessary act of self-defense but also as a deterrent against future provocations. As tensions in the region remain high, the U.S. continues to demonstrate its resolve to protect its interests and ensure the safety of its brave service members.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a powerful response to repeated attacks on American forces, the U.S. military executed a precise airstrike on a Syrian facility known to store weapons for Iranian forces.

The court’s rejection of the lawsuit, which cited a constitutional provision against those involved in insurrection holding office, marks a significant triumph for Trump and his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit’s dismissal by the Minnesota Supreme Court steers clear of setting a historical precedent using Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This outcome affirms the state’s stance that political parties hold the prerogative to select their candidates for the primary ballot without interference. Chief Justice Natalie Hudson, in her statement, emphasized that no existing state law prohibits major political parties from endorsing a candidate, regardless of perceived eligibility to hold office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ruling maintains Trump’s position in the primary election race, it leaves the door open for future legal challenges potentially targeting his general election campaign in November. The plaintiffs, spurred by the liberal group Free Speech For People, have indicated their intent to persist in their legal efforts to halt Trump’s presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal challenge in Minnesota is part of a broader effort by Free Speech For People and another liberal organization to leverage Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in their nationwide campaign against Trump’s run in the GOP presidential primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s reaction to the court’s ruling was swift and celebratory, denouncing the lawsuit as a ‘ridiculous’ and ‘hoax’ on his social media platform, Truth Social.

&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Supreme Court’s decision is not just a win for Trump but also a reinforcement of the broader legal and constitutional implications of electoral eligibility.

The bust, which unfolded early Wednesday morning, marks a significant move in clamping down on illegal operations that have been stealthily operating since 2020 across Massachusetts and Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrested, identified as Han Lee, James Lee, and Junmyung Lee, are accused of running brothels in high-end apartments and using websites for advertising their illegal services. These digital platforms showcased detailed profiles of the women involved, including photographs and physical descriptions, under the guise of scheduling appointments for ‘professional photography’—a front that was nothing more than a veneer for the underlying illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a stringent vetting process, potential clients were asked to submit personal and employment details before being given the green light to engage with the service. The brothel’s business model was calibrated to allure a clientele with deep pockets, with rates ranging from $350 to over $600 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sophistication of the operation was further underscored by the lengths the organizers went to launder the proceeds. From cash deposits into personal accounts to the strategic purchase of money orders to evade detection, their meticulous approach to finance obscured the tracks of their illegal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the law has caught up with them. The indictment not only paints a clear picture of the operation’s inner workings but also alludes to the ongoing investigation into the clients who patronized the network. The trio now faces up to 20 years behind bars, showcasing the severity of their alleged crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This crackdown has sent ripples through the upper echelons of society, putting on notice those who might consider themselves above the law due to their status. It’s a stark reminder that illegal activities, no matter how concealed or exclusive, are subject to the rigorous scrutiny of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

The bust, which unfolded early Wednesday morning, marks a significant move in clamping down on illegal operations that have been stealthily operating since 2020 across Massachusetts and Virginia. The arrested, identified as Han Lee, James Lee, and Junmyung Lee, are accused of running brothels in high-end apartments and using websites for advertising their illegal services. These digital platforms showcased detailed profiles of the women involved, including photographs and physical descriptions, under the guise of scheduling appointments for ‘professional photography’—a front that was nothing more than a veneer for the underlying illicit activities. In a stringent vetting process, potential clients were asked to submit personal and employment details before being given the green light to engage with the service. The brothel’s business model was calibrated to allure a clientele with deep pockets, with rates ranging from $350 to over $600 per hour. The sophistication of the operation was further underscored by the lengths the organizers went to launder the proceeds. From cash deposits into personal accounts to the strategic purchase of money orders to evade detection, their meticulous approach to finance obscured the tracks of their illegal enterprise. However, the law has caught up with them. The indictment not only paints a clear picture of the operation’s inner workings but also alludes to the ongoing investigation into the clients who patronized the network. The trio now faces up to 20 years behind bars, showcasing the severity of their alleged crimes. This crackdown has sent ripples through the upper echelons of society, putting on notice those who might consider themselves above the law due to their status. It’s a stark reminder that illegal activities, no matter how concealed or exclusive, are subject to the rigorous scrutiny of justice. As this case unfolds, it will undoubtedly serve as a cautionary tale for those engaged in or considering similar illicit activities. The pursuit of justice remains unyielding, and as the investigation continues, the implications for the high-profile clients involved remain to be seen.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Donald Trump Jr. Takes Aim at McConnell’s Ukraine Stance at Florida Rally</title><link href="/news/2023/11/09/Mitch-McConnell-Mockery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Donald Trump Jr. Takes Aim at McConnell’s Ukraine Stance at Florida Rally" /><published>2023-11-09T10:58:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-09T10:58:00-05:00</updated><id>/news/2023/11/09/Mitch-McConnell-Mockery</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/11/09/Mitch-McConnell-Mockery/">&lt;p&gt;In a fiery display of political theater, Donald Trump Jr. lambasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s stance on Ukraine, coining the term ‘Mitch glitch’ to mock the veteran senator’s recent public freeze-ups. The crowd at the Hialeah, Florida rally, which was held concurrently with the third Republican primary debate, roared with laughter as Don Jr. theatrically mimicked McConnell’s infamous mid-speech pauses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rally, spearheaded by former President Donald Trump, turned into a referendum on GOP leadership and priorities as Don Jr. questioned the audience about their stance on U.S. aid to Ukraine. The overwhelming response from the attendees signaled a stark disconnect between the GOP base and McConnell’s policy focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ‘Mitch glitch’ quickly resonated with the crowd, encapsulating their discontent with McConnell’s unwavering support for Ukraine amidst a plethora of domestic issues that rally-goers feel should take precedence. Don Jr.’s performance tapped into a vein of frustration among conservative voters who are calling for a shift away from what they perceive as establishment-driven, interventionist foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rhetorical survey of the audience, Don Jr. challenged them to raise their hands if they considered funding Ukraine to be among their top priorities. The lack of any hands raised painted a clear picture of the crowd’s stance, which Don Jr. highlighted by declaring no one saw it as even a top ten issue. His point was underscored by an anecdote that, out of 30,000 people surveyed at various rallies, only one hand had gone up in support — and that was from a Ukrainian national.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Jr.’s critique extended beyond McConnell, as he called out Senate Republicans and so-called “RINOs” (Republicans In Name Only) to heed the voice of the people. His plea for “actual representation” from elected officials resonated with the attendees, who are yearning for a Republican party that aligns more closely with their values and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp critique of McConnell’s foreign policy stance by the former First Son at this rally highlights a growing rift within the Republican Party, as grassroots energy pushes against established norms. The ‘Mitch glitch’ moment at the rally has become symbolic of this tension, emphasizing the desire for a reorientation of the GOP’s priorities towards the pressing needs of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a fiery display of political theater, Donald Trump Jr. lambasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s stance on Ukraine, coining the term ‘Mitch glitch’ to mock the veteran senator’s recent public freeze-ups.

This decisive move signals the committee’s intensified efforts to unravel the intricacies of the Biden family’s global business operations and any potential involvement of President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sweeping investigation, spearheaded by the House Oversight Committee, digs deeper into the complex web of the Biden family’s financial transactions. The panel’s action includes a call for transcribed interviews from several close associates and family members of President Biden, further expanding the scope of the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas come on the heels of earlier financial record subpoenas that unveiled over $1 million in payments to Bidens from accounts associated with Rob Walker. This revelation has added fuel to the House GOP’s determination to uncover the full extent of the Biden family’s dealings, particularly those that could link President Biden to various business ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the investigation is a contentious debate over whether the President was privy to or financially benefited from these enterprises. The subpoenas and interviews are poised to play a pivotal role in the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Biden, led by a trio of key GOP committee chairmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for testimony from Hunter and James Biden, as well as Rob Walker, punctuates a series of probes that have scrutinized bank records and financial transactions linked to the Biden family. Revelations from these records have sparked new lines of questioning about the extent of the President’s awareness and involvement in his family’s business pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden, a central figure in the controversy, has faced intense scrutiny over his business ties, with financial dealings involving Chinese energy firms and other overseas interests drawing particular attention. The discovery of significant payments to members of the Biden family, and the subsequent subpoena for Hunter Biden, underscores the gravity of the committee’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oversight Committee’s bold steps send a clear message of accountability and transparency, underscoring the GOP’s commitment to examining the intersection of private business and public service. As the investigation unfolds, the testimonies of Hunter and James Biden, along with their associates, could shed light on a saga that has captured the nation’s attention and raised serious ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a striking escalation of their probe into the Biden family’s business engagements, the House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas for testimony from Hunter Biden, James Biden, and business associate Rob Walker.

The bold statement came Wednesday night as Trump outlined his vision to reinforce U.S. borders and restore immigration policies that were dismantled under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s commitment underscores a return to his hallmark border security policies, which include staunch measures against illegal immigration. Addressing a charged crowd, he expressed a sense of urgency to address what he perceives as a national security threat, stating, “We have bad people, terrorists at levels that nobody has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former president criticized the current administration’s handling of border policies, suggesting that it has allowed terrorists to infiltrate the U.S. amid the ongoing Middle Eastern unrest. Trump emphasized the need for legal immigration processes, saying, “We wanted people to come to our country, but we wanted them to come in legally, legally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With national security at the forefront of his address, Trump extended his rhetoric to those who participated in protests he described as pro-jihadist, indicating a zero-tolerance approach. “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests… We put you on notice, Come 2025, we will find you and we will deport you,” he declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s promises at the rally reflect his continued commitment to conservative principles on immigration and border control, a cornerstone of his previous administration and a key issue for his campaign. His resolve to conduct a sweeping deportation operation aims to resonate with voters who prioritize the integrity of national borders and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rally concluded, Trump’s message was clear: a reinvigorated focus on deporting individuals who are in the country illegally and pose a threat to national security. While the specifics of such an operation remain to be detailed, Trump’s address in Florida has undoubtedly set a definitive tone for his campaign’s approach to immigration and homeland security.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a decisive declaration at his Hialeah, Florida rally, former President Donald Trump committed to what he termed the “largest domestic deportation operation” in U.S. history, as part of his campaign promises.
