A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-10T09:19:53-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-10T09:19:53-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/10/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump Holds Biden Responsible for Israel Crisis</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/10/Trump-Israel-Conflict/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump Holds Biden Responsible for Israel Crisis" /><published>2023-10-10T09:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-10T09:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/10/Trump-Israel-Conflict</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/10/Trump-Israel-Conflict/">&lt;p&gt;WOLFEBORO, N.H. – At a crucial campaign stop in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump levied strong criticisms against President Joe Biden regarding the recent deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas. Trump is of the firm belief that such atrocities in Israel would never have occurred had he still been in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, who is seeking the presidency for the third consecutive time, emphasized that under his leadership, peace in the Middle East was maintained, specifically citing the Abraham Accords. Drawing a clear line between the peace of his term and the current unrest, Trump stated, “Today we have an all-out war in Israel, and it’s going to spread very quickly. What a difference a president makes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant point of contention in Trump’s speech was a recent move by the Biden administration involving a $6 billion transfer to Iran. This move, aimed at releasing five detained U.S. citizens, involved the transfer of frozen Iranian assets from South Korea to an account in Doha, Qatar. Republicans, including Trump, argue that this deal inadvertently provided resources that aided Hamas’ assault on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has emphasized its unwavering support for Israel in these trying times. President Biden remarked that the U.S. stands firmly with the people of Israel and will ensure the nation has the resources to defend itself. Despite these assurances, the central criticism from the Republican side remains fixated on the financial transfer to Iran, seeing it as a misstep that indirectly fueled the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump further elaborated on his administration’s tough stance on Iran, highlighting how he reduced the Iranian economy, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and imposed sanctions. In a bid to keep America safe, he also initiated strict travel bans targeting radical Islamic terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His commitment to Israel was clear as he vowed, “As president, I will once again stand strongly with the state of Israel, and we will cut off the money to the terrorists on day one.”&lt;/p&gt;

Her opinions, shared with her millions of followers, have sparked significant debate online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalifa, boasting a massive following of 5 million on Twitter and 27.5 million on Instagram, shared a plethora of posts on Saturday expressing her firm stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Referring to one image of the aggressors, she commented that it looked like a “Renaissance painting.” Mia Khalifa’s significant reach ensures that her perspectives make a notable impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the subject of the long-standing conflict, Khalifa remarked, “If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid and history will show that in time.” She further expressed disbelief at the idea of the “Zionist apartheid regime” facing challenges from guerrilla fighters, some of whom she humorously noted were donned in “fake Gucci shirts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalifa was not alone in her sentiments. She reposted statements from fellow influencers, such as Kelbin with 130,000 followers, who expressed that the attacks showcased the oppressed fighting their oppressor. Another influencer, Sana Saeed with 110,000 followers, shared her personal experience of receiving applause and support when identifying as Palestinian in Istanbul markets. A sentiment of supporting Palestinians was prevalent among various posts shared by Khalifa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s essential to note that Mia Khalifa’s outspokenness is not solely restricted to political matters. Known for her brief yet impactful stint in the adult film industry, she has been vocal about her regrets concerning her past decisions. In 2020, she joined OnlyFans, where she shares content described as “safe for work, but spicy.” By August 2023, Mia made headlines with a clip promoting “marriage advice,” wherein she advocated for women to leave unsatisfactory relationships, emphasizing the non-sanctimonious nature of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the vast realm of social media, where opinions are shared and spread at lightning speed, voices like Mia Khalifa’s play a pivotal role. Whether one agrees or disagrees with her positions, the influence she wields cannot be denied.

Having sold his Malibu home for $6.25 million earlier this year, he has set up roots in Las Vegas, highlighting his dissatisfaction with California’s governance and policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My home in Malibu was going to be my forever home,” Cain reminisced, emphasizing his love for the scenic beauty and weather. However, he lamented, “Governments can ruin an area. And that’s what’s going on in California.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the significant challenges Cain points to is California’s substantial governance, which he describes as laden with “incredible taxation” and “horrible regulations.” Dean’s criticisms do not stand in isolation. Many Californians have raised concerns about the state’s rising taxes, from income tax, which stands at a high bracket of around 13%, to numerous other taxes, including those on gas, sales, food, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the financial aspects, Dean Cain also cited concerns about California’s stance on crime, its growing homelessness crisis, and specific policies like a bill addressing child custody and gender identity issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These collective issues have fueled what Cain sees as a “mass exodus” from California. “The things that our leaders in California have been doing have driven out anybody who can really afford to get out,” he stated. He also criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration, sharing that he didn’t vote for the current leadership, although many in California did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Cain acknowledges the state’s undeniable allure. California, particularly regions like Malibu, offers some of the best weather conditions. The actor fondly recalled instances when he experienced dramatic temperature shifts traveling between Calabasas and Malibu. He admits missing Malibu’s perfect weather but was quick to point out that vast areas of California experience temperatures as high as those in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now settled in Nevada, Cain is full of praise for his new home. Besides the allure of no state income tax, he enjoys the vibrancy of sports and entertainment options available in the state. Plus, he is particularly impressed with his new home, describing it as ten times nicer than his Malibu residence and more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his recent relocation has garnered attention, Dean Cain continues to be active in his acting career. He stars in the new movie “Condition of Return,” where he plays a psychoanalyst evaluating a woman’s mental fitness to stand trial after she commits a massacre. Cain mentions that he drew from his real-life experiences as a sworn deputy sheriff and reserve police officer to prepare for this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Dean Cain’s move from California is symbolic of a broader sentiment. As individuals evaluate the quality of life, governance, and opportunities, states like Nevada are becoming increasingly attractive. Whether this trend continues remains to be seen, but for now, stars like Cain are voting with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Dean Cain, best known for his role as Superman, recently shared insights on his decision to leave California, a state he believed he would never abandon.

Among them is Donald Trump Jr., who recently took to social media to underline the importance of the Second Amendment in the U.S., using the Israeli conflict as a backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening of October 8, 2023, Trump Jr. wrote, “If anyone is still doubting the relevance of the 2nd amendment, just watch the videos from Israel. It’s a harsh reminder of the need for self-defense.” The sentiment, while pointed, reflects a larger conversation about individual rights to bear arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier that day, Breitbart News pointed out the disparity between the well-equipped Israeli army and the average Israeli citizen. Unlike the U.S., Israel doesn’t have a constitutional right that guarantees its citizens the right to bear arms. In fact, gun ownership in Israel stands at a mere 2% of its population, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, a study by Rutgers University’s New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center indicates that up to 60% of Americans own firearms. The distinction between the two nations, in many respects, lies in the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which ensures every American’s birthright to gun ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has strict restrictions on the type of firearms its citizens can own and the amount of ammunition they can possess. The BBC noted that Israelis typically can own a pistol with a cap of 50 bullets. Comparatively, in most American states, individuals can own an array of firearms, including machine guns, with no limitation on ammunition storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the terror attacks in Israel, Trump Jr. further emphasized his stance on gun rights, stating, “Don’t ever give up your guns!!!” He later added, suggesting the importance of self-defense, “If you don’t yet own an AR-15 you really need to think that through right about now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discourse sheds light on the ongoing global debate about gun rights, individual protection, and the role of governments in ensuring security for its citizens. Whether in the U.S. or Israel, the conversation around self-defense and gun ownership remains as pertinent as ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the turmoil intensifies in Israel, public figures worldwide are chiming in with their perspectives.

This international crisis, which has many looking to the US for a response, comes at a time when Republicans are pressing for a prompt installment of a new leader to address these global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the House of Representatives currently missing a Speaker, it’s been hamstrung in its ability to swiftly tackle the situation, even as the crisis escalates. This gap in leadership has been acutely felt, given that President Joe Biden has not sought a formal request from Congress and the Senate remains in recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the urgency, the White House has remained relatively quiet on the issue. Monday morning saw a lid called, meaning no public comments from President Biden until at least Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting with limited authority is Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry (R-NC), whose role is based on rules established post 9/11. However, his recent actions suggest a readiness to stretch these powers, evidenced by his recent eviction of Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Steny Hoyer (R-MD) from prime Capitol office space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of a solid leader has led to a legislative standstill. While House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and ranking Democrat Gregory Meeks (D-NY) have drafted a pro-Israel resolution, real legislative actions remain stagnant. This standstill is even more pronounced when considering that some members of the political sphere, like members of the Squad, have been vocally critical of the US-Israel relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a keen awareness among Republicans about the missed political opportunities this presents. Without clear leadership, they’re unable to effectively address divisive issues within their own ranks or capitalize on differences among Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the situation in Israel becomes more volatile, it’s evident that both parties are feeling the heat to move quickly. Potential contenders for the Speaker position include Reps.

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the sudden Hamas-Israel crisis has added another layer of complexity to an already heated political atmosphere in the US.

This international crisis, which has many looking to the US for a response, comes at a time when Republicans are pressing for a prompt installment of a new leader to address these global challenges. With the House of Representatives currently missing a Speaker, it’s been hamstrung in its ability to swiftly tackle the situation, even as the crisis escalates. This gap in leadership has been acutely felt, given that President Joe Biden has not sought a formal request from Congress and the Senate remains in recess. Despite the urgency, the White House has remained relatively quiet on the issue. Monday morning saw a lid called, meaning no public comments from President Biden until at least Tuesday. Acting with limited authority is Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry (R-NC), whose role is based on rules established post 9/11. However, his recent actions suggest a readiness to stretch these powers, evidenced by his recent eviction of Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Steny Hoyer (R-MD) from prime Capitol office space. The absence of a solid leader has led to a legislative standstill. While House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and ranking Democrat Gregory Meeks (D-NY) have drafted a pro-Israel resolution, real legislative actions remain stagnant. This standstill is even more pronounced when considering that some members of the political sphere, like members of the Squad, have been vocally critical of the US-Israel relationship.

This criticism is deeply intertwined with the grave news of Americans being killed or taken hostage during Hamas’ unexpected attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the White House National Security Council made an official announcement confirming the unfortunate loss of multiple American lives during this assault. The timing of this announcement is particularly poignant, as a memo about a scheduled White House barbecue surfaced the very next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the memo, “The President and First Lady are hosting a barbecue for White House Executive Residence staff and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confluence of these two events — the barbecue and the news of the Hamas attack — ignited a storm of outrage. Critics and commentators from various political backgrounds voiced their concerns, with many pointing out the seemingly inconsiderate juxtaposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for instance, took to his platform to express his dismay, stating, “While Hamas holds Americans hostage, Joe Biden is enjoying a picnic with a live band.” Similarly, reporter Jennie Taer commented on the disconcerting situation, citing that a war was unfolding in the Middle East involving US citizens, all while the president and the First Lady were hosting a BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political commentators and former White House officials also voiced their opinions. Katie Pavlich, a conservative commentator, and Brilyn Hollyhand, a political commentator, both highlighted the tragedy of American citizens being impacted by the conflict and juxtaposed it with the president’s decision to host a BBQ. Karoline Leavitt, a MAGA Inc. spokeswoman, contrasted Biden’s actions with those of former President Trump, suggesting the latter would’ve been more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other individuals, from journalists to commentators, also expressed their deep concerns and frustrations, with some using the tagline, “BBQ First, America Last” to summarize their sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the backdrop of this controversy, it’s important to note that the Hamas attack over the weekend resulted in the tragic loss of American lives. Confirmations from the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Mike Herzog, and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, further highlighted that American citizens were among the hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the situation continues to evolve, the decisions and actions of the Biden administration remain under intense scrutiny by both the American public and global onlookers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a surprising turn of events, President Joe Biden and his administration have come under heavy criticism for reportedly hosting a barbecue at the White House.

Bob Menendez, a robust group of New Jersey state Senate Republicans is pushing to empower the judiciary committee with investigatory and subpoena capabilities. The goal? To deeply probe allegations suggesting the New Jersey Office of Attorney General may have been influenced by Menendez’s federal bribery scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican leader Sen. Anthony Bucco, at the forefront of this group, emphasizes the necessity of this move. The indictment against Menendez not only accuses the Senator of pressuring officials to dismiss criminal cases but also brings to light concerns about the integrity of officials at the New Jersey Office of Attorney General. Questions arise if they were potentially involved in the senator’s alleged crimes or if there were lapses in safeguarding protocols against such public corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/720/405/AP23270448628318.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey arriving at the federal courthouse in New York, Sept. 27, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core segment of the indictment zeroes in on a disturbing narrative involving Menendez, his wife, and three New Jersey businessmen. One of these businessmen, Jose Uribe, reportedly purchased a Mercedes-Benz convertible, valued over $60,000, for Menendez and his wife, following a tragic incident where she accidentally struck a pedestrian. The indictment then insinuates that in return, Menendez attempted to intervene in an investigation against Uribe, conducted by the New Jersey attorney general’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these serious allegations and their potential ramifications on state governance, any decision to grant the judiciary committee subpoena power would have to be collectively approved by the full state Senate. Key figures, including New Jersey Senate President Nicholas Scutari and judiciary committee chairman, Brian Stack, both Democrats, would also need to greenlight the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Senate Republicans have made their stance clear. While they do not wish to impede the federal investigation into Menendez, the claims associated with the state’s attorney general office are squarely within the domain of the New Jersey Legislature. Their objective? To fulfill their constitutional responsibility by investigating and implementing any reforms deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a comprehensive search conducted in June 2022 at Menendez’s residence, the FBI discovered a plethora of assets - from cold hard cash to luxurious items. The evidence, as per prosecutors, links Menendez to businessman Fred Daibes, another principal figure in the purported bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how this political saga will unfold. But one thing is clear: the issue has resonated deeply in New Jersey politics, with potential nationwide implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In light of the recent indictment of Democratic U.S. Sen.

&lt;p&gt;While the proposed bill had aimed to decriminalize the possession and personal use of these substances for adults over 21, Newsom expressed reservations. His stance is surprising, especially given his supportive history toward cannabis legalization back in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill, designed to take effect in 2025, emphasized the non-commercial nature of decriminalization. It would have only applied to personal use, excluding the selling of these substances, and would’ve ensured that individuals possessing limited amounts of such hallucinogens would not face prosecution or arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsom, in his official statement, conveyed the need for regulated treatment guidelines, ensuring therapeutic and safety standards before such a move. The legislation’s objective also included instructing the California Health and Human Services Agency to delve deeper into the therapeutic use of psychedelics and provide insights to lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With psychedelics gaining momentum as potential treatment options for various mental health conditions, it’s a hot topic. For instance, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) recognized psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy for treatment-resistant depression as recently as 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many proponents, including combat veterans and emergency responders, tout the benefits of psychedelics for trauma treatment. Joe McKay, a firefighter who worked during the devastating 9/11 attacks, is an example, having publicly expressed how psilocybin transformed his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is on board. Concerns range from the potential ease of access for younger individuals to the currently uncharted benefits and risks of these substances. The California Coalition for Psychedelic Safety and Education, which opposed the bill, emphasized the need for more safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill’s author, expressed disappointment in the veto, advocating for the numerous Californians who’ve found solace in these substances. Wiener emphasized the evident drawbacks of criminalizing such substances and hinted at revisiting the topic with future legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, other states and cities have shown progressive stances on this issue. Oregon and Colorado have made strides toward decriminalizing psychedelics, and cities like Oakland and San Francisco in California have already decriminalized certain natural psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how this veto will shape the future of psychedelic decriminalization in California. With potential ballot initiatives slated for 2024, Californians may get another shot at making their voices heard on this divisive issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a bold move, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation intended to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms and other hallucinogens, sparking mixed reactions across the state and country.
