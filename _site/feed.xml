A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump vs. Biden - A Michigan Showdown on the Horizon?</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/18/Trump-Biden-Michigan-Showdown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump vs. Biden - A Michigan Showdown on the Horizon?" /><published>2023-09-18T09:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-18T09:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/18/Trump-Biden-Michigan-Showdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/18/Trump-Biden-Michigan-Showdown/">&lt;p&gt;Michigan, often regarded as the heartbeat of America’s political battlegrounds, has once again captured national attention. A recent poll by Susquehanna Polling and Research suggests that if a presidential election were to take place today between Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, the outcome would be too close to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trump-and-biden-the-michigan-standoff&quot;&gt;Trump and Biden: The Michigan Standoff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll, initially shared with the Hill, indicates that 46% of probable Michigander voters would rally behind Biden, with Trump trailing close at 43%. Surprisingly, a considerable 11% remain undecided. With a margin of error standing at 3.7%, it’s clear: these political heavyweights are virtually tied in the Wolverine State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s strong grip on the GOP is evident, with a commendable 90% support from his party base. Comparatively, Biden garners support from 87% of Democrat respondents. Jim Lee, the president of Susquehanna Polling and Research, pointed out a significant tidbit: Biden’s support among Democrats in Michigan has seen a slight dip from 97% in 2020. On the other hand, Trump’s GOP support remains consistent, witnessing only a minor dip from 94% in the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;independents--the-national-trend&quot;&gt;Independents &amp;amp; the National Trend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Biden seems to have a modest lead with independent voters in Michigan (44% vs. Trump’s 37%), national trends are slightly leaning in Trump’s favor. Both Harvard-Harris and CBS News/YouGov polls depict Trump holding an edge among the independent voters at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;michigan-a-legacy-of-close-calls&quot;&gt;Michigan: A Legacy of Close Calls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Michigan has been a decisive battleground. Trump’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton by a mere one-third of a percentage point is a testament to that. Comparatively, Biden’s win over Trump in 2020 was by a little less than three percentage points. A shift of a few votes can change the course of history in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trump-leads-the-gop-desantis-trails&quot;&gt;Trump Leads the GOP, DeSantis Trails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Trump vs. Biden matchup is drawing significant attention, there’s also a buzz around other potential contenders. If Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida were to be pitted against Biden, he’d fare slightly worse than Trump, lagging behind by three more points. However, within the GOP, Trump remains the alpha, garnering a massive 65% support, leaving DeSantis trailing significantly at 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these polls provide a sneak peek into the current political sentiment, they’re merely snapshots in time. Michigan’s political landscape has always been dynamic, and only time will reveal the true sentiments of its voters. One thing remains certain: Michigan will be a state to watch in any upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Michigan, often regarded as the heartbeat of America’s political battlegrounds, has once again captured national attention.

The farmer exercised his constitutional right by holding two suspected burglars at gunpoint on his land until the police arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crime-halted-by-vigilance&quot;&gt;Crime Halted by Vigilance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, around 7 p.m., Grant County deputies received a report of two individuals suspected of burglary on a farm in Quincy. The farmer discovered these intruders on his property, allegedly attempting to target two of his farm shops. Acting responsibly and quickly, the farmer drew his firearm, holding the suspects in place until law enforcement could take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon investigation, the deputies, with the aid of footprints found inside the shops, identified the two men as 45-year-old Glenn Richard of Quincy and 28-year-old Jesus Rangel of Mattawa. Both were subsequently arrested on burglary charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, Kyle Foreman, commended the responsible gun owners in the county. Speaking to local media, he stated, “We have many responsible gun owners here in Grant County and if they are outside protecting their property, they can certainly hold someone at gunpoint and then call 911 to have us come and investigate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreman further elaborated on the legal grounds supporting the farmer’s actions. The law in Washington allows residents to reasonably detain someone who unlawfully enters their property, as long as the detention is reasonable in both duration and manner. This legal provision ensures property owners can safeguard their belongings and lands from potential intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

It offers a compelling narrative in favor of responsible gun ownership, particularly in areas where properties might be vulnerable to such criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a society where property crimes are increasingly prevalent, it’s vital that citizens feel empowered and have the means to protect themselves and their belongings.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listening-and-learning&quot;&gt;Listening and Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrymore, known for her roles in various hit movies and her recent venture into daytime television, shared her decision on social media. “I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show’s premiere until the strike is over,” she stated on her Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surprising announcement comes a week after she declared her support for the strike, yet revealed plans to continue recording her show. Her reasoning? To ensure the rest of her show’s crew, whose livelihoods depend on the show, could get back to their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ongoing writers’ strike, combined with a work stoppage from the Screen Actors Guild, has effectively brought most of North America’s TV and film productions to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, within a day, this emotional video was no longer available on her profile, raising more questions about the internal and external pressures faced by celebrities during such industry disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-decision-not-taken&quot;&gt;The Decision Not Taken&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking with NBC’s “Meet the Press” host, Kristen Welker, Trump didn’t hold back. He stated, “Nancy Pelosi was in charge of security. She turned down 10,000 soldiers. If she didn’t turn down the soldiers, you wouldn’t have had Jan. 6.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welker challenged Trump’s stance, mentioning that Pelosi lacked the same security authority he possessed as the commander in chief. But Trump countered by highlighting how the Capitol police, who he described as “great people,” had testified against Pelosi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/720/405/GettyImages-1683740340.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Trump speaking at the Pray Vote Stand Summit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Former President Donald Trump holds firm to his belief that former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, played a significant role in the Jan. 6 events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump reiterated that Pelosi held authority over the Capitol and that her alleged refusal to bolster security with the National Guard, even after his request, was a major oversight. In his eyes, Pelosi’s decision is a clear indicator of her responsibility for the events of January 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-versions-of-the-story&quot;&gt;Different Versions of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there have been conflicting accounts on who was responsible for the security decisions that day. Some point out that the choice to summon National Guard troops to the Capitol rests with the Capitol Police Board, which includes members like the House and Senate sergeants at arms. These officials reportedly decided against deploying the Guard before the riots but called for backup when the situation intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former Capitol Police Chief, Steven Sund, previously stated to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that he had requested backup several times both before and during the riot. According to him, these pleas were either delayed or denied outright.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of focusing on age, he believes competency tests would be more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump, at age 77, shared his views. He responded to host Kristen Welker’s questions about age limits, especially since Trump and current President Joe Biden, who’s 80, are potential opponents in the 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalling a test he took a few years ago at Walter Reed, Trump said, “I aced it. I get everything right. I’m all for testing. I frankly think testing would be a good thing.” But is it constitutional? The former president believes some might see it that way, though he isn’t certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump added, “[You] know, some of the greatest world leaders have been in their 80s. I’m not anywhere very near 80, by the way.” He emphasized that it’s not about Biden’s age but his competence, which he sees as a bigger concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about Trump’s age? If he wins the 2024 elections, he’ll be nearing 80 in his term. Biden, if re-elected, would be 82 at the beginning of his next term. Biden’s age has been a frequent topic of discussion due to occasional lapses in memory and stuttered speeches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vocal advocate for competency testing is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. She’s been proactive in pushing for cognitive tests for politicians, particularly for those over 75. Notably, she hasn’t supported age limits. Mockingly referring to the U.S. Senate as “the most privileged nursing home in the country,” she called for legislation that would require competency tests for both presidential candidates and Congress members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haley’s comments came in the wake of health concerns involving Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Discussing their health episodes, she remarked, “It’s sad. No one should feel good about seeing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming 2024 Republican Presidential Primary, Haley is set to challenge Trump. However, current polls indicate Trump’s lead over other candidates remains significant. Despite this, Trump voiced his appreciation for the idea of a female vice president, assuring that he would “pick the best person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate around age and competence is unlikely to subside, especially as the 2024 elections approach. But one thing is clear: the need for efficient and competent leadership is paramount, no matter the age.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">While age limits for politicians are gaining traction in public discourse, former President Donald Trump has a different take.

The former president believes some might see it that way, though he isn’t certain. Trump added, “[You] know, some of the greatest world leaders have been in their 80s. I’m not anywhere very near 80, by the way.” He emphasized that it’s not about Biden’s age but his competence, which he sees as a bigger concern. But what about Trump’s age? If he wins the 2024 elections, he’ll be nearing 80 in his term. Biden, if re-elected, would be 82 at the beginning of his next term. Biden’s age has been a frequent topic of discussion due to occasional lapses in memory and stuttered speeches. Another vocal advocate for competency testing is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. She’s been proactive in pushing for cognitive tests for politicians, particularly for those over 75. Notably, she hasn’t supported age limits. Mockingly referring to the U.S. Senate as “the most privileged nursing home in the country,” she called for legislation that would require competency tests for both presidential candidates and Congress members. Haley’s comments came in the wake of health concerns involving Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Discussing their health episodes, she remarked, “It’s sad. No one should feel good about seeing that.” In the upcoming 2024 Republican Presidential Primary, Haley is set to challenge Trump. However, current polls indicate Trump’s lead over other candidates remains significant. Despite this, Trump voiced his appreciation for the idea of a female vice president, assuring that he would “pick the best person.” The debate around age and competence is unlikely to subside, especially as the 2024 elections approach. But one thing is clear: the need for efficient and competent leadership is paramount, no matter the age.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Biden’s Oversight - Texas Border Town Overrun by Unprecedented Migrant Numbers</title><link href="/news/2023/09/17/Biden-Texas-Migrant-Surge/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Biden’s Oversight - Texas Border Town Overrun by Unprecedented Migrant Numbers" /><published>2023-09-17T15:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-17T15:52:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/17/Biden-Texas-Migrant-Surge</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/17/Biden-Texas-Migrant-Surge/">&lt;p&gt;The Texas border town of Eagle Pass experienced an extraordinary and concerning day when, in just 24 hours, over 1,300 migrants were apprehended. This number surpassed the combined total from all eleven El Paso Border Patrol Sector stations, highlighting a serious surge in this small town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strained-system&quot;&gt;A Strained System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eagle Pass, with a population of only around 30,000 residents, is feeling the pressure. The apprehensions in a single day have overwhelmed the town’s Border Patrol processing facility and the ability of non-government (NGO) shelters to accommodate such a surge. This immense inflow has left the local system stretched thin, with one source noting, “In just one eight-hour shift, more than 700 migrants were taken into custody. We lack the capacity to deal with it. This system is broken.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overburdened-facilities&quot;&gt;Overburdened Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only one soft-sided processing facility operating in the area, the number of detained migrants skyrocketed to over 3,000. This volume is three times its designated capacity. Unfortunately, this overload prompted the Border Patrol to conduct mass releases into the town. Migrants, without sufficient funds for travel, were observed attempting the daunting walk from Eagle Pass to San Antonio, Texas, a journey spanning over 150 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-failing-response&quot;&gt;A Failing Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy from the top seems disconnected from the ground reality. Instead of effectively addressing the growing crisis, the response appears to be one of surrender. “Our facilities are full, the NGO shelters have exceeded their capacity as well, and we are releasing every migrant we can just to stay afloat,” an inside source shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local residents are feeling the brunt of this surge firsthand. Migrants wander the city streets, lacking funds for bus tickets or meals. The only NGO shelter, Mission Border Hope, has had to turn away migrants who can’t afford the $50 bus ticket to San Antonio. This situation puts these migrants in an even more vulnerable position, expecting them to travel hundreds of miles without adequate resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the town’s Border Patrol aims to release migrants to the shelter, intending to prevent adding to the homeless population, the lack of proper planning and infrastructure has made this a losing strategy. “We had no knowledge that the poorest of migrants would be thrown out on the streets and expected to walk more than 150 miles to the next largest city, but that is where we are,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that Eagle Pass, and Texas at large, needs an effective solution that addresses the immediate concerns of overwhelmed facilities and the long-term implications of mass releases into small towns. At the core of this crisis is the Biden administration, which must acknowledge its role and take definitive action to mend this worsening situation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The Texas border town of Eagle Pass experienced an extraordinary and concerning day when, in just 24 hours, over 1,300 migrants were apprehended.

This time, it’s not for his skills on the football field but for a dispute over family ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adopted-or-not&quot;&gt;Adopted or Not?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Oher filed a lawsuit against Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, the family that took him in during high school. In the lawsuit, he accused them of falsely presenting themselves as his adoptive parents. He also claimed they kept financial details hidden from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuohys responded in court. They said they never intended to legally adopt Oher but always saw him as part of their family. They admit calling him their son, but they say it was only in a casual way, not in a legal sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-just-words&quot;&gt;More Than Just Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this a big deal? Well, Oher believes the Tuohys used their relationship to make money from him. But the Tuohys say they’ve always supported Oher, giving him a home, food, and even cars. They also mentioned that the only reason they became Oher’s conservators (people who make legal decisions for someone) was to follow college sports rules. Without being a part of the Tuohy family, Oher might not have been able to play football for the University of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuohys also pointed out that in Oher’s book from 2011, “I Beat the Odds,” he knew they were his conservators and not his adoptive parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-story-still-unfolding&quot;&gt;A Story Still Unfolding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lawsuit shows that family ties can be complex, especially when money and fame are involved.

This unique reptile’s story of survival has now earned it a home at Gatorland Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-survivors-tale&quot;&gt;A Survivor’s Tale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t every day you come across an alligator missing half of its upper jaw. When local resident Eustacia Kanter spotted the young reptile in Sanford, even she had trouble processing what she was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At first, my brain couldn’t comprehend that its entire upper jaw was missing,” recounted Kanter. Once the initial shock wore off, her compassion kicked in. Kanter promptly captured a photo from a safe distance, aiming to share it with those who might offer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-wild-to-safe-haven&quot;&gt;From Wild to Safe Haven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter’s initiative led her to contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and an environmental conservation nonprofit. The goal? Find and safely rescue this rare gator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alligator, believed to be between four to five years old, managed to avoid capture for several weeks, displaying a level of resilience that is truly awe-inspiring. It’s estimated that this fighter had been living in the wild in its present condition for at least six months, subsisting mainly on smaller prey like snails and frogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspected cause of the gator’s injury is a boat’s engine propeller. Despite the drastic injury, the creature’s vitality remains intact. “Alligators and crocodiles are amazing survivors,” emphasized Savannah Boan from Gatorland. “They can survive almost anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-home&quot;&gt;A New Home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reptile, which made national headlines due to its unique condition, has found a comfortable new abode at Gatorland Orlando. Officials have mentioned that it will remain separated from other animals initially and be placed on a special diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’s a little bit skinny, but she looks to be pretty healthy and feisty,” Boan observed, expressing optimism about the gator’s future at the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;got-a-name-in-mind&quot;&gt;Got a Name in Mind?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of this incredible survivor is still unfolding, and now, Gatorland is inviting the public to contribute. They are encouraging people to suggest names for this distinctive gator via the park’s social media channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many, this gator represents the epitome of resilience.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, eyeing the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, showed his backing for Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who’s actively blocked multiple military appointments. Why? He’s protesting the Pentagon’s abortion policy which was introduced earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence firmly stated his views during a speech on Friday. “Sen. Tommy Tuberville is right, and the Pentagon is wrong,” Pence declared, committing to halt taxpayer dollars from undermining pro-life laws if he takes office. Tuberville’s stance, however, has led to a six-month holdup in the Senate, affecting over 300 pending military promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest also means that Army, Marine Corps, and Navy leaders are currently in interim positions, which curtails their authority. This occurs because of the Senate’s delay in confirming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the Pentagon’s policy that’s causing this ripple? They’ve pledged to cover the travel costs for service members either seeking abortions or supporting their spouses during such procedures. This policy allows up to five months, or 20 weeks into a pregnancy, for service members to inform their departments and ask for travel assistance for these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Pence is not alone in his support for Tuberville. Other Republicans have also echoed similar sentiments. Nevertheless, there’s also criticism from both sides of the aisle and the military. For instance, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, critiqued Tuberville’s strategy, saying, “holding these non-policymaking career military [officials] is a mistake.” Similarly, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, pointed out the national security risks, stating Tuberville’s holds are “paralyzing the Department of Defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence, who’s been vocal about his anti-abortion stance, was the first 2024 presidential candidate to back a 15-week national abortion ban. He stated, “I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it,” emphasizing his commitment to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hold on promotions doesn’t sit well with many. Inside sources claim it compromises national security and might even push those awaiting promotions to look for jobs outside the military. A joint op-ed by the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force emphasized the negative impact, stating, “Any claim that holding up the promotions of top officers does not directly damage the military is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mounting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, recent polls among Alabama voters suggest that the majority would prefer Tuberville to end his block on military promotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Pentagon’s abortion policy has stirred controversy, and now it’s influencing military promotions.
