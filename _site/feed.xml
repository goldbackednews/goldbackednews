A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">McCormick’s Second Shot - A Fresh Hope for Pennsylvania Republicans?</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/23/McCormick-Run-For-Senate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="McCormick’s Second Shot - A Fresh Hope for Pennsylvania Republicans?" /><published>2023-09-23T15:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-23T15:45:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/23/McCormick-Run-For-Senate</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/23/McCormick-Run-For-Senate/">&lt;p&gt;David McCormick, the businessman and Army veteran who narrowly missed out on a Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seats in Pennsylvania last year, is back with renewed fervor. This time, he is setting his sights on another seat, voicing his intention to contest against Democrat Sen. Bob Casey Jr. He made this announcement at Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-vision-for-change&quot;&gt;A Vision for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick declared his commitment to combating what he perceives as the failures of President Joe Biden’s leadership, promising to usher in positive change. He cited concerns over the country’s alleged decline economically, militarily, and spiritually and expressed his vision for a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-strong-republican-candidate&quot;&gt;A Strong Republican Candidate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick’s re-entry into the political fray has been welcomed by key Republicans, like Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, highlighting his unique profile as a West Point graduate, combat veteran, and job creator in Pennsylvania. His ability to self-finance and his high-profile status are considered assets that could potentially tip the scales in one of the most competitive states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivations-and-goals&quot;&gt;Motivations and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent interview with Fox News, McCormick outlined several motivating factors for his decision, including the prevailing border crisis, rampant inflation, and the perceived attack on the domestic energy sector. He criticized Sen. Casey for his alleged ineffectiveness and unwavering support for Biden’s policies during his long tenure in politics, pledging to be a “force for good” in opposing such policies if elected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-critical-state&quot;&gt;A Critical State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick’s bid comes at a crucial time for Pennsylvania, a state pivotal for the Republican Party’s aspirations to regain control of the Senate in 2024. Currently, Republicans are just two seats short of a majority and one from a split chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;previous-run-and-future-prospects&quot;&gt;Previous Run and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his previous run, McCormick competed for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, narrowly losing to Dr. Mehmet Oz in the primary. With Pennsylvania being a focal point in upcoming political battles, McCormick’s campaign may serve as a crucial component for Republicans to make significant inroads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick’s announcement to run against Sen. Casey marks a renewed hope for Pennsylvania Republicans. With his strong background and commitment to addressing key issues, McCormick is poised to be a formidable contender, promising to reshape the political landscape and bring forth substantive change to the state’s Senate representation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">David McCormick, the businessman and Army veteran who narrowly missed out on a Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seats in Pennsylvania last year, is back with renewed fervor.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-concert-with-a-cause&quot;&gt;A Concert with a Cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift, known for her superlative contributions to the music industry, is now harnessing her influence to emphasize the importance of political participation. Her music tour has become a fertile ground for fostering civic engagement, with the pop icon explicitly encouraging her fans, endearingly called “Swifties”, to register to vote, emphasizing her alignment with progressive ideologies and Democratic candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her performances, Swift interlaces her setlist with fervent appeals to her fans to ensure their voices are heard in the upcoming elections. “I’ve been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my US shows recently,” Swift shared on Instagram Stories, illustrating her continuous commitment to encouraging young fans to partake in the democratic process. “I’ve heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you’re ready to use them in our elections this year!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swifts-progressive-stance&quot;&gt;Swift’s Progressive Stance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift’s foray into political discourse is not a new phenomenon. She has consistently used her substantial platform to voice her opinions on an array of socio-political issues, from LGBTQIA+ rights to women’s rights, and has never shied away from expressing her support for the Democratic party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her outspoken stance on various progressive causes has long been a subject of public discourse, catalyzing conversations about the intersection of celebrity and politics. Swift’s decision to intertwine her musical pursuits with political activism reflects her conviction in leveraging her reach to foster change and her belief in the power of collective voices to shape the nation’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Swift officially endorsed Joe Biden’s bid for the White House, putting her colossal influence in the service of the Democratic presidential ticket. She highlighted issues such as abortion and gay rights as pivotal in her endorsement, illustrating her alignment with progressive values and her commitment to advocating for social justice and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impactful-resonance-or-political-noise&quot;&gt;Impactful Resonance or Political Noise?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift’s synthesis of music and political dialogue raises questions about the role of artists in shaping political landscapes and whether her calls for voter registration may sway her vast fan base towards left-leaning ideologies. The blending of entertainment and politics through her music tour opens up debates on the influence celebrities wield in political realms and whether their platforms should be used to advance particular political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her advocacy surely resonates with a segment of her fans, aligning with their own ideological stances, it also risks alienating those who may not share her political views. The interplay of music and politics in Swift’s tour emphasizes the potential impact of celebrity voices in political discourses and reflects the evolving role of artists in societal conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swift’s initiative to promote voter registration and her unabashed exposition of her political leanings showcase the multifaceted nature of her career, where melodies harmonize with messages of political empowerment and activism. Whether it results in a symphony of civic engagement or discordant political debates, Swift’s political symphony is playing a noteworthy role in the larger narrative of celebrity and politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">As the lights dim and the music starts, fans attending Taylor Swift’s latest concert series experience more than just the infectious melodies of the pop sensation; they encounter Swift’s pronounced left-wing political activism, with the artist using her platform to advocate for voter registration.

This most recent lapse, coupled with a repeated, verbatim anecdote during a fundraiser, has intensified discussions regarding his age and suitability for the presidential role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgotten-gestures-and-lost-words&quot;&gt;Forgotten Gestures and Lost Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Biden, after speaking about workers’ rights at the United Nations in New York City, conspicuously left Brazilian President Lula hanging, exiting the stage after shaking hands with another dignitary. This disregard, perhaps unintended, visibly irked President Lula, drawing the eyes of the international community to Biden’s actions or the lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recurring-narratives-spark-concern&quot;&gt;Recurring Narratives Spark Concern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compound matters, the president echoed the same story, nearly word for word, within minutes at a separate fundraiser event. This, rapidly highlighted on social media, brought forth renewed speculation about the effects of his age on his presidential duties, creating a ruckus in the online and offline political domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;age-related-speculations-and-public-opinion&quot;&gt;Age-Related Speculations and Public Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These instances have triggered a fresh wave of skepticism about Biden’s aptitude for a second term, spotlighting his age as a potential hindrance to effective leadership. A recent poll by Associated Press-NORC indicated widespread concern, with 77% of respondents, including a substantial 69% of Democrats, questioning his fitness for another term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-of-minor-slip-ups&quot;&gt;Implications of Minor Slip-ups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While seemingly inconsequential, such slip-ups raise imperative questions about Biden’s competency and the possible ramifications of such oversights on a global stage. The world meticulously scrutinizes a president’s every move, and minor mishaps can have substantial repercussions, shaping national and international perceptions and influencing subsequent policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of the discourse now revolves around whether such lapses are mere innocuous blunders or indicative of deeper, more serious issues related to aging and capability that warrant immediate attention. It is crucial to ponder how these narratives might alter public opinion and potentially reconfigure the political scenario in the forthcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where leadership demands meticulous attention to detail and nuanced understanding of international relations, Biden’s forgetful moment and repeated tales are more than just trivial errors; they are critical lapses that call his capacity to lead into question.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-rapid-and-mysterious-departure&quot;&gt;A Rapid and Mysterious Departure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qin Gang’s swift and secretive disappearance has ignited global intrigue, particularly given his previous status as a celebrated protégé of Xi Jinping. His tenure as the Foreign Minister of China was abruptly cut short, lasting a mere seven months before he was inexplicably replaced, creating a fertile ground for speculations and conspiracy theories about internal conflicts and cover-ups within the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swirling-rumors-and-unverified-reports&quot;&gt;Swirling Rumors and Unverified Reports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official stance on Qin’s disappearance remains deliberately vague and non-committal. However, whispers have surfaced, primarily from The Wall Street Journal’s sources, suggesting that his sudden exit is related to undisclosed “lifestyle issues,” commonly interpreted as a euphemism for sexual indiscretions within the Chinese Communist Party. These unconfirmed reports suggest a possible extramarital affair resulting in a child born on American soil. However, the veracity of these claims is yet to be substantiated, and the Chinese authorities maintain a conspicuous silence regarding his current whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-political-embarrassment&quot;&gt;A Political Embarrassment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abrupt and disorderly handling of Qin’s position has raised several eyebrows and fuelled speculations of internal power struggles and a potential source of embarrassment for Xi Jinping. While political purges are not a rarity in China, the typically meticulous and calculated approach to high-level transitions seems to be conspicuously absent in Qin’s case, indicating possible deeper turmoil and unrest within the ranks of the government.&lt;/p&gt;

This decision intensifies the competitive atmosphere surrounding the GOP’s presidential nomination debates, as candidates must now meet higher polling and donor thresholds to make it to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stricter-criteria-for-candidates&quot;&gt;Stricter Criteria for Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates aiming to participate in the third debate must secure a minimum of 70,000 unique donors, along with 200 donors from at least 20 states, to their campaign or exploratory committee. The decision on these thresholds was taken during a debate committee conference call and is seen as a notable escalation from the previous debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to donor support, candidates must also garner 4% support in two national polls or achieve 4% in one national and two statewide polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, or South Carolina, which are the first four states in the Republican presidential nominating calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-evolving-debate-landscape&quot;&gt;The Evolving Debate Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifying thresholds have been steadily rising with each debate. The first debate, hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee, required candidates to attain 1% in the polls and secure 40,000 donors, allowing eight contenders to face off. For the upcoming second debate, which is set at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California, the criteria were raised to 3% in the polls and 50,000 donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six out of the eight candidates from the first debate have already met the RNC’s heightened criteria for the second debate, including prominent figures like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and former Vice President Mike Pence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allegiance-to-the-party&quot;&gt;Allegiance to the Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from meeting donor and polling thresholds, candidates must also sign a pledge committing their support to the eventual Republican presidential nominee. This agreement prohibits candidates from participating in non-RNC sanctioned debates for the remainder of the 2024 election cycle and mandates data-sharing with the national party committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;former-presidents-stand&quot;&gt;Former President’s Stand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, former President Donald Trump, who met the donor and polling criteria, chose not to sign the RNC’s pledge, citing his significant lead over other candidates. Consequently, he did not attend the first debate and has already arranged alternative plans for the next showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-on-the-race&quot;&gt;Impact on the Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of these stringent norms signifies the RNC’s attempt to streamline the nomination process and ensure that only the most competitive and supported candidates make it to the debate stage. This move is likely to bring forth more focused and substantive discussions, allowing voters to make informed decisions in the run-up to the 2024 Presidential Election. Whether this elevated bar will serve to clarify or complicate the field remains a point of intrigue as the debates unfold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Republican National Committee (RNC) is raising the stakes for presidential candidates, enforcing stricter qualifying criteria for the third debate in November. This decision intensifies the competitive atmosphere surrounding the GOP’s presidential nomination debates, as candidates must now meet higher polling and donor thresholds to make it to the stage. Stricter Criteria for Candidates Candidates aiming to participate in the third debate must secure a minimum of 70,000 unique donors, along with 200 donors from at least 20 states, to their campaign or exploratory committee. The decision on these thresholds was taken during a debate committee conference call and is seen as a notable escalation from the previous debates. In addition to donor support, candidates must also garner 4% support in two national polls or achieve 4% in one national and two statewide polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, or South Carolina, which are the first four states in the Republican presidential nominating calendar. The Evolving Debate Landscape The qualifying thresholds have been steadily rising with each debate. The first debate, hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee, required candidates to attain 1% in the polls and secure 40,000 donors, allowing eight contenders to face off. For the upcoming second debate, which is set at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California, the criteria were raised to 3% in the polls and 50,000 donors. Six out of the eight candidates from the first debate have already met the RNC’s heightened criteria for the second debate, including prominent figures like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and former Vice President Mike Pence. Allegiance to the Party Apart from meeting donor and polling thresholds, candidates must also sign a pledge committing their support to the eventual Republican presidential nominee. This agreement prohibits candidates from participating in non-RNC sanctioned debates for the remainder of the 2024 election cycle and mandates data-sharing with the national party committee. Former President’s Stand Interestingly, former President Donald Trump, who met the donor and polling criteria, chose not to sign the RNC’s pledge, citing his significant lead over other candidates. Consequently, he did not attend the first debate and has already arranged alternative plans for the next showdown. Impact on the Race The imposition of these stringent norms signifies the RNC’s attempt to streamline the nomination process and ensure that only the most competitive and supported candidates make it to the debate stage. This move is likely to bring forth more focused and substantive discussions, allowing voters to make informed decisions in the run-up to the 2024 Presidential Election. Whether this elevated bar will serve to clarify or complicate the field remains a point of intrigue as the debates unfold.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taking Charge - Kamala Harris Heads New Office of Gun Violence Prevention</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking Charge - Kamala Harris Heads New Office of Gun Violence Prevention" /><published>2023-09-23T07:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-23T07:09:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/23/Gun-Control-Initiative/">&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris has been chosen by President Joe Biden to lead a groundbreaking new executive-level Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is reportedly on a mission to reinstate the traditional Senate dress code, a policy recently relaxed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). This development suggests a rising disagreement within the party lines over the decorum of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;return-to-formality&quot;&gt;Return to Formality?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchin is believed to be circulating a proposal to restore the formal dress code, requiring Senators to don business attire on the Senate floor. This push comes in direct contrast to Schumer’s recent pronouncement, allowing Senators to choose their preferred dress while on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fettermans-fashion-statement&quot;&gt;Fetterman’s Fashion Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) is particularly noticeable under the new dress code, appearing in sweatshirts and shorts in the Capitol. His unconventional attire, in alignment with his “blue-collar tough guy” persona, contrasts sharply with his Harvard education and seemingly affluent background. His attire has sparked conversations on authenticity, with many questioning the sincerity behind his average joe portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voices-in-opposition&quot;&gt;Voices in Opposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans and even some Democrats seem to support the return to a more formal dress code. They argue that maintaining a degree of formality and dignity is crucial to uphold the reputation of the Senate. Sen. Tommy Tuberville expressed his displeasure with the relaxed dress code, emphasizing his discontent with the casual attires. Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins believes that maintaining a formal dress code is integral to preserving the dignity of the Senate institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-reflection-of-a-deeper-issue&quot;&gt;A Reflection of a Deeper Issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dispute over dress code may reflect deeper tensions within the Senate, touching on notions of decorum, respect, and the image senators wish to project. While some view the relaxed dress code as a degradation of Senate traditions, others may see it as a step towards modernization and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Manchin’s move to restore formal attire could be interpreted as a pursuit to maintain the sanctity and the revered image of the Senate. Whether his proposal will gain enough traction remains to be seen, but it certainly highlights the differing perspectives within the Senate on maintaining tradition versus embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Sen.

In a discussion on Newsmax’s “American Agenda,” he voiced concerns over the significant influence and control exercised by the authorities during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-impact-on-education&quot;&gt;The Impact on Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson criticized the sweeping measures, such as school shutdowns, arguing they have had severe and long-lasting impacts on the learning and development of children. He believes it could take years, if not decades, for the educational setbacks experienced during the pandemic to be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allegations-of-manipulation&quot;&gt;Allegations of Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former HUD Secretary accuses the government of not prioritizing the welfare of the citizens and focusing instead on controlling and manipulating people. He fears the grave implications if such practices continue and calls for a critical examination of the repercussions of the mandates imposed during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funding-for-at-home-covid-tests&quot;&gt;Funding for At-Home COVID Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement of a $600 million funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests, Carson emphasized the importance of not succumbing to fear and manipulation. This funding initiative is aimed at averting possible shortages during an anticipated rise in coronavirus cases during the colder months and resolving supply chain issues experienced during past surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carsons-clarion-call&quot;&gt;Carson’s Clarion Call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson’s strong message to the American people is to not be “manipulated and terrified by COVID.” He urges rationality and an understanding of the facts surrounding the virus, such as its evolving, typically weaker variants. He warns against unnecessary fear due to increased positive test results and calls for resistance against any attempts to impose further business and school shutdowns which could lead to economic distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-the-people&quot;&gt;We, The People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Carson’s plea is for vigilance and a unified stance by the people against government overreach and control. He emphasizes that it is the collective responsibility of the citizens to assert their rights and safeguard their freedoms against any perceived attempts to disrupt lives and livelihoods under the guise of public health measures. He argues that a repeat of the stringent controls and mandates witnessed during the pandemic could have devastating and lasting impacts on the society and economy, making it imperative for the people to be informed, rational, and resolute in their response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Ben Carson, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, raises the alarm on what he perceives as attempts by the U.S. government to control the American populace through mandates related to COVID-19.
