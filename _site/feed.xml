A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Tim Scott Fires Back - Claims Democrat Party ‘Stuck in Jim Crow Era’</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/15/Tim-Scott-Response/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tim Scott Fires Back - Claims Democrat Party ‘Stuck in Jim Crow Era’" /><published>2023-09-15T13:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-15T13:03:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/15/Tim-Scott-Response</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/15/Tim-Scott-Response/">&lt;p&gt;In a recent appearance on FNC’s “Hannity,” Sen.

&lt;p&gt;Sunny Hostin, a co-host on “The View,” drew parallels between Scott and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, specifically noting the potential for Scott to marry a white woman, akin to Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife. This sparked a discussion between Sean Hannity and Scott about the implications and motivations behind such comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing Hannity’s query on whether such remarks played the race card, Scott didn’t hold back. “Absolutely, Sean.

He further expressed his perspective that while a black individual in America has the liberty to be anything, being conservative seems to be an exception in the eyes of many. Scott labeled Hostin’s comments as “radical” and “disgusting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a poignant conclusion, Scott emphasized his belief that narratives like his, showcasing the journey of black conservatives, are intentionally overlooked as they challenge the narratives espoused by the radical left. “They don’t want my life story to be told because it difficulties results the lies of the radical left,” Scott added. Expressing his disappointment, he remarked, “I can’t think of anything more disgusting and more disheartening to watch the Democrat Party descend down into the 1920s. Unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside her husband, &lt;strong&gt;Derick Dillard&lt;/strong&gt;, Duggar has penned a memoir titled “Counting the Cost,” wherein she delves into the intricate balance of maintaining familial ties while stepping out of the shadows of a life dominated by the TV lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-reality-star-to-empowered-individual&quot;&gt;From Reality Star to Empowered Individual&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jill’s trajectory from the confines of her reality TV fame to where she stands today - on the edge of Arkansas and Oklahoma, cherishing the joys of motherhood to three boys - is nothing short of transformative. Sporting a nose ring, wearing pants, and embracing therapy, Jill exudes the aura of someone who has finally broken free from the shackles that once bound her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her memoir, which recently hit the bookshelves, serves not just as a tell-all but more importantly as a cathartic release. “It’s helped us process and disentangle our feelings,” Jill mentions. Reflecting on the broader implications of her story, she hopes it resonates with many, underscoring that the feelings of isolation stemming from control aren’t isolated to her life or the world of reality TV.&lt;/p&gt;

Accusations fly high with claims of weaponizing her marriage and prioritizing the protection of her controversial brother, &lt;strong&gt;Josh Duggar&lt;/strong&gt;, over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Counting the Cost” boldly brings to light the estrangement with her father, hinting at a bond now filled with “hornets and garter snakes.” While the future remains uncertain, Jill remains hopeful, expressing, “I hope and pray that it does get better. I love my dad… I love my family so much. And I don’t want to hurt them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to step away from the TV lens in 2017 wasn’t an easy one, yet Jill and Derick, looking back, have no second thoughts. Despite the love for their family, their need for autonomy and control over their narrative pushed them to make this monumental decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wanted us to have more control of our lives,” states Jill, reflecting on the liberating sensation of being free from the reality show grind. The fears of detachment from the family loomed large, but the desire for a genuine life far from the cameras outweighed it all.&lt;/p&gt;

This decision comes after lawyers Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro expressed their intentions for an expedited trial, initially set for October 23. Trump and several other co-defendants had communicated their preference for a separate trial timeline, emphasizing the significance of thorough readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Fani Willis had initially pushed for a collective trial for all 19 defendants. However, given various factors including tight timetables, Judge McAfee decided to separate Trump and the majority of the defendants from Powell and Chesebro.&lt;/p&gt;

Similarly, Trump-aligned lawyer Eric Herschmann had previously voiced skepticism regarding Powell’s assertions related to the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;

As the world absorbs the details of the accusations, Roiland has been quick to deny the claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-praise-to-prosecution&quot;&gt;From Praise to Prosecution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrated for his contribution to the world of animation, Roiland’s public image is being overshadowed by a wave of accusations, including sexual assault and inappropriate interactions with underage fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, he faced charges of felony domestic violence against an ex-girlfriend, which were eventually dismissed due to a lack of evidence. However, the repercussions were palpable, with the acclaimed animator being shown the door from ‘Rick and Morty’, the very show that cemented his status in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-than-just-words&quot;&gt;More Than Just Words?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recently published NBC News report has further ignited the controversy. Based on testimonies from 11 individuals, including women and gender “nonbinary” persons, the report sheds light on the alleged inappropriate conversations Roiland engaged in over various platforms from 2013 to 2022. A disturbing pattern emerges, with three interviewees claiming they were just 16 when the exchanges took a sexual turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly harrowing account from a woman suggests that after a Tinder interaction in 2019, Roiland, despite being aware of her age, bought her alcohol and later attempted to force her into a sexual act. Although Roiland has labeled these allegations as “false and defamatory”, the testimonies continue to mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-traces&quot;&gt;Digital Traces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBC report provides evidence in the form of text messages that appear to display a lack of awareness or remorse on Roiland’s part. Disturbingly, he even used the term “jailbait” in reference to 16-year-olds, making light of their age and making suggestive comments about their future.&lt;/p&gt;

With the potential for a sentence reaching up to 25 years in prison, the consequences are significant. This comes amid an already shaky political climate where President Biden himself is under the magnifying glass due to a formal impeachment inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Counts, One Impending Storm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s indictment is not simple. It encompasses three criminal counts, each carrying its own weight of potential penalties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm. If convicted, this alone could see Hunter facing up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A deceptive statement related to records essential for a federal firearms dealer. Conviction here could culminate in a five-year prison term, another $250,000 fine, and an additional three years under supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances. This count can land him another decade in prison, with an equivalent fine and supervision period as the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aggregated, the potential consequences are daunting: a quarter of a century behind bars and fines totaling $750,000. Overseeing this intricate case is Special Counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Deals and a Father Under Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indictment follows Hunter’s plea agreement’s collapse earlier this year. Back in July, Hunter was on track to plead guilty to two misdemeanors related to tax evasion in a bid to eschew incarceration on a more serious gun-related felony charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as Hunter’s legal woes continue to unravel, President Biden isn’t immune to scrutiny. A formal impeachment inquiry is underway, spurred by “serious and credible allegations into President Biden’s conduct,” as articulated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden’s Lawyer Strikes Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these charges, Hunter’s legal counsel, Abbe Lowell, retaliated, condemning the “MAGA Republicans’ improper and partisan interference in this process”. He suggested that the charges lodged, which the prosecutors deemed unwarranted merely six weeks ago, stem from a politically-driven shift rather than a genuine pursuit of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell maintains that Hunter, who held an unloaded gun for less than two weeks, was no threat to public safety. In contrast, he posits that a prosecutor succumbing to political pressures endangers the very fabric of the justice system. Leveraging an earlier agreement with the prosecutors and recent federal court rulings, Lowell is confident of demonstrating Hunter’s innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Looming Shadow on the Biden Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the President contends with the whispers of impeachment and his son faces these grave charges, one thing becomes clear: the Biden legacy is under significant threat. With the nation watching intently, how this drama unfolds could shape the course of American politics for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden family finds itself in turbulent waters again as Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, stands indicted on federal firearm charges.

In contrast, he posits that a prosecutor succumbing to political pressures endangers the very fabric of the justice system. Leveraging an earlier agreement with the prosecutors and recent federal court rulings, Lowell is confident of demonstrating Hunter’s innocence. A Looming Shadow on the Biden Legacy As the President contends with the whispers of impeachment and his son faces these grave charges, one thing becomes clear: the Biden legacy is under significant threat. With the nation watching intently, how this drama unfolds could shape the course of American politics for years to come.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">‘One Down, Eleven to Go’ - Trump Fires at ‘Crooked Joe’ Amid Hunter Biden’s Charges</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/15/Trump-Crooked-Joe/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="‘One Down, Eleven to Go’ - Trump Fires at ‘Crooked Joe’ Amid Hunter Biden’s Charges" /><published>2023-09-15T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-15T08:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/15/Trump-Crooked-Joe</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/15/Trump-Crooked-Joe/">&lt;p&gt;In a fiery denouncement, former President Donald Trump recently castigated the indictment of Hunter Biden on three gun charges, notably emphasizing their lack of connection to President Joe Biden, whom he infamously termed “Crooked Joe”. This overt criticism not only underscores Trump’s tenacious grip on conservative narratives but also showcases the deep-seated partisanship that continues to dominate American politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump on Hunter’s Charges: The Tip of the Iceberg?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s recent post on Truth Social succinctly encapsulated his stance on the matter: “This, the gun charge, is the only crime that Hunter Biden committed that does not implicate Crooked Joe Biden. One down, Eleven to go!” With this remark, the former President alludes to eleven other allegations made by Republican lawmakers concerning Hunter Biden’s purported tax and money laundering crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cementing his position, Trump lamented the Democrats’ actions, equating them to opening a “Pandora’s Box” that might spell doom for the very fabric of the country. In his words, “The Democrats, with all of their horrible, very unfair, and mostly illegal Witch Hunts, have started a process that is very dangerous for our Country… SO SAD!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debunking the “Neutral” Prosecutor Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer to this complicated saga, Trump highlighted the role of David Weiss, the Department of Justice special counsel who announced the indictment against Hunter Biden. Contrary to the mainstream media and Democrats’ narrative that portrayed Weiss as a Trump-appointed neutral figure, the former President shed light on a deeper connection. “Prosecutor Weiss is appointed by the 2 Democrat Senators of Delaware under Blue Slip!” Trump revealed, thus exposing the longstanding Senate policy known as the “blue slip”, which allows senators from the home state to greenlight presidential appointments of U.S. attorneys and judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that Weiss has been on Hunter Biden’s case for alleged tax evasion and gun charges since 2018. A potential plea deal was once on the table, which would have granted Hunter immunity from jail time and further prosecution. However, this deal, which smells suspiciously of privilege and nepotism, foundered when Delaware U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika declined to endorse it. Following this, in a twist, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Weiss as special counsel in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling a Political Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s indictment brings to the forefront a plethora of unanswered questions about the Biden family’s dealings, especially in the context of the former Vice President and current President Joe Biden. The murkiness surrounding these allegations, combined with the intense scrutiny and criticism from conservative quarters led by influential figures like Trump, calls for transparent investigations.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-silent-compromise&quot;&gt;The Silent Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaacson’s biography paints a picture of Musk as a leader seemingly willing to compromise core values for the sake of business continuity. During a conversation with journalist Bari Weiss, Musk’s cautious stance on China, especially concerning his management of Twitter, raised eyebrows. Instead of championing free speech and human rights, Musk hinted at tempering Twitter’s language to safeguard Tesla’s foothold in the massive Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Musk’s reticence did not end there. When confronted about China’s widely-condemned treatment of the Uyghurs, he ambiguously stated that the issue had “two sides.” This seeming equivocation casts a shadow on Musk’s integrity, suggesting his views may be tainted by his vested business interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-alarming-pledge&quot;&gt;An Alarming Pledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s recent move to endorse China’s “core socialist values” further underscores Musk’s unsettling willingness to appease the Chinese Communist Party. This commitment, unprecedented for a non-Chinese company, earned him plaudits from Chinese officials. However, it simultaneously drew sharp criticism globally, with many viewing it as an alarming indication of Musk’s readiness to overlook glaring human rights violations in pursuit of profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Musk’s vocal support for the controversial reunification of Taiwan with China only compounds these concerns, leading many to question where Musk’s true loyalties lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsettling-admiration-for-an-authoritarian-regime&quot;&gt;Unsettling Admiration for an Authoritarian Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Musk’s seemingly effusive praise for China’s work ethics and business acumen has not gone unnoticed. While there’s no denying China’s prowess in the business domain, Musk’s overt admiration, especially in light of recent developments, raises suspicions about whether his comments are genuine or simply a ploy to curry favor with the authoritarian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk’s recent disclosures, as portrayed in Isaacson’s biography, lay bare the uneasy relationship between global business interests and political ethics. While business leaders often have to navigate complex political landscapes, the extent to which Musk seems willing to bend in the face of China’s communist pressure is both startling and concerning. Time will tell if his reputation remains untarnished in the wake of these revelations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The billionaire magnate Elon Musk, celebrated globally for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and now X/Twitter, appears to be succumbing to the pressures exerted by China’s Communist regime, as revealed in Walter Isaacson’s explosive new biography.

He cancelled an upcoming performance in Knoxville, Tennessee, in response to the venue’s alleged sharp ticket price increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Anthony was catapulted into the spotlight after his politically-infused track, “Rich Men North of Richmond,” became an internet sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue, Anthony voiced his disappointment on Facebook, explaining his intentions for keeping his shows budget-friendly. “These are supposed to be affordable shows,” he emphasized, adding, “It’s also horses— that they’re charging extra for VIP meet and greet. Those are supposed to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of exorbitant concert ticket prices, Anthony’s commitment to affordability is refreshing. Moreover, he shed light on allegations made by the venue, Cotton Eyed Joe, which claimed Anthony was demanding $120,000 for his performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the record straight, the singer detailed, “The most I’ve ever made on a show is $35,000. We’ve done two shows in NC that were completely free, and have another free show scheduled September 23rd in Kentucky for a cancer benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Anthony expressed his frustrations with the venue’s alleged misleading claims, he also acknowledged his responsibility in the matter. “All the fault ultimately is with me. I should have been more thoroughly involved in the booking, and I should probably consider using a professional consultant in this area,” he admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fans of the country sensation need not be dismayed. Oliver Anthony has already arranged an alternate venue for his performance in Knoxville. He recently announced a new concert date at the Knoxville Convention Center on September 29, promising an affordable and fun-filled evening for his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragic event unfurled at Alabama’s Cheaha State Park, when Adam Simjee, 22, and his girlfriend, Mikayla Paulus, heeded Hider’s fabricated plea for help with her supposedly broken down XB Scion. The innocent students were unaware that Hider’s car issue was an elaborate ploy; the Scion had malfunctioned weeks prior. The unsuspecting couple were drawn into a sinister plot of robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed in the plea agreement, a chilling confrontation ensued when Hider suddenly brandished a firearm at Simjee and Paulus, demanding their belongings. In an effort to defend both himself and Paulus, Simjee revealed his own gun. A fierce gunfight erupted between Hider and Simjee, culminating in injuries to both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drenched in shock and despair, Hider, with bullets in her abdomen and leg, expressed her regret, muttering, “It wasn’t supposed to be like this.” As the reality of the calamity became clear, an alleged associate of Hider’s, Krystal Pinkins, briefly made an appearance from the thicket, only to quickly vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulus, in the face of abject horror, frantically dialed 911, attempting to resuscitate her critically wounded boyfriend. Despite her best efforts, Simjee tragically succumbed to his injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a poignant online tribute to her fallen partner, Paulus lamented, “The rest of my life will be a love letter to him. I’ll miss you and love you forever sweet boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement’s investigations illuminated a darker, more convoluted narrative. Both suspects, Pinkins and Hider, had been leading an “off-the-grid” lifestyle in the Talladega National Forest, adjacent to the crime scene. Startlingly, they were found to have affiliations with notorious cult leader Rashad Jamal White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama further intensified when, during Pinkins’ arrest, her five-year-old son emerged brandishing a loaded firearm. The child eventually surrendered the weapon, facilitating Pinkins’ arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to FBI interrogations, Pinkins disclosed that they had entrusted Hider with the gun. Furthermore, they had attempted a similar deceit on an older woman just a day prior, which, fortunately, did not proceed as the lady declined their beckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chilling case serves as a somber reminder of the unpredictability of life and the lurking shadows behind innocent facades.
