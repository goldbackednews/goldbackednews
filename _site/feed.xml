A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Rep.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has emerged as a refreshing voice of clarity and conviction. Drawing a line in the sand, Luna has decisively declared her support for a House speaker only if they are unwavering in their commitment to bring President Joe Biden’s impeachment to the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the surprising exit of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the distinguished speaker’s position, Luna didn’t shy away. She succinctly laid out the path for integrity in leadership: “A speaker who stands up against Jack Smith’s questionable election interference probes, ensures accountability by subpoenaing Hunter Biden, and remains resolute in ushering an impeachment vote for Joe Biden.” Luna’s principled stance was shared with the nation on X, the successor to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a heartfelt emphasis on safeguarding transparent elections and eliminating governmental shadows, Luna rightfully pointed out, “The very essence of America depends on actions reflecting these values. My support is conditional on these uncompromising terms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, the House is in a precarious position. The absence of a speaker has left the legislative body in limbo, requiring the swift election of a dedicated leader to move forward. It’s noteworthy that Luna, in her continued pursuit of genuine representation, opted not to participate in the contentious vote which led to McCarthy’s ousting. McCarthy’s departure was marked by eight of his party members aligning with Democrats, resulting in a narrow 216-210 vote against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, although McCarthy had ignited the spark of an impeachment inquiry against Biden, he abstained from seeing it through to a vote, betraying the anticipation of many. Luna’s initial reluctance to back McCarthy earlier this year is now seen in a new light. After days of voting and uncertainty, McCarthy clinched the speaker position on the 15th ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with Luna’s commendable and straightforward stance, the nation watches keenly. Who among the House leadership will step up, aligning with Luna’s vision for a transparent and accountable America? As the winds of change blow through Washington, it’s evident that the discussion surrounding Biden’s potential impeachment could very well shape the House’s leadership narrative in the coming phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In times where true leadership and principles seem to be waning in Washington, Rep.

However, their relationship is once again in the limelight, not for a new track or tech innovation, but for a legal tussle involving the parental rights of their three uniquely-named children: X Æ A-Xii, Exa Dark Sideræl, and Techno Mechanicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grimes, known offstage as Claire Boucher, recently lodged a “petition to establish parental relationship” in a California court, as reported by the Daily Mail. Such petitions serve to legally identify a child’s parents, especially when the parents have never tied the knot. Beyond mere identification, these petitions can be a stepping stone to child custody and support order proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this move, the 35-year-old artist hasn’t publicly expressed desires regarding child support or custody rights. As for Musk, the visionary behind ventures such as Tesla and SpaceX, there hasn’t been any public acknowledgment or response to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grimes’ concerns run deeper than formalities. A now-removed post on the platform, X, conveys her anguish: “Tell Shivon to unblock me and tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer,” she said, alluding to Shivon Zilis. Zilis, an executive at Musk’s neurotech firm, Neuralink, bore Musk’s twins via IVF, though she maintains a strictly professional relationship with him. Grimes’ pain is palpable as she continues, “I have never even been allowed to see a photo of these children until this moment, despite the situation utterly ripping my family apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, whose family tree boasts 11 branches in the form of his children, seems to have complex dynamics when it comes to parenthood. Besides the trio with Grimes, he has 17-month-old twins, Azure and Strider, with Zilis, and six more children with his first wife, Justine Wilson. Tragically, one of them, Nevada, succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as an infant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Tesla CEO’s vocal concerns about potential population declines, his stance on having children seems clear. As he expressed on X, “Having children is saving the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this legal drama unfolds, fans and onlookers can only hope for a resolution that prioritizes the well-being of the children involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In the world of entertainment and tech billionaires, few partnerships have garnered as much attention as that of singer Grimes and entrepreneur Elon Musk.

As the media spotlight zooms in on this harrowing case, the supposed offspring hopes that his father “dies in prison.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Sena’s disappearance made headlines when she vanished after a simple bike ride in Lake Moreau State Park. Fortunately, the child was later found, having been hidden in a cabinet within Ross’s unkempt camper, parked behind another property in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tumultuous case has captured the nation’s attention, as desperate searches led to an unexpected outcome. After the young girl’s ordeal, her family expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the various agencies, volunteers, and community members who rallied together to ensure Charlotte’s safe return. The Sena family is now channeling their efforts to help Charlotte recover, dedicating a GoFundMe campaign to support the 9-year-old’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Jr., now in custody on charges of first-degree kidnapping, had previously left a ransom note in the Sena family’s mailbox, leading to his arrest. The swift action of state police was pivotal in capturing Ross Jr., with their investigation further bolstered by evidence from a past DUI arrest in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As investigators don their Tyvek suits, poring over Ross Jr.’s Porter Corners residence and removing key evidence, the unexpected appearance of a man claiming to be the accused’s son added another layer to this unfolding drama. Frustrated and overwhelmed, he vented his dismay, stating, “Yeah, he’s my father, but why do I have to deal with this? Everyone is asking me all this. I don’t know anything. I hate him and hope he dies in prison.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case serves as a sobering reminder of the impact of crime not only on the victims but also on the families of those accused. The community’s support has been unwavering, with the New York State Police and the FBI receiving particular praise for their role in ensuring Charlotte’s safe return.&lt;/p&gt;

What was supposed to be a 10-hour layover in Dubai turned into a four-month-long legal challenge, landing her on the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) no-fly list and resulting in a year-long jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Los Santos, after vacationing in Turkey, was returning home via Dubai International Airport. However, things took a turn on July 14 when she encountered issues with customs officials. The New York student’s “waist trainer” corset, which she wore due to recent surgery, set off detectors, leading to further screening. In a private room, when asked to remove her garment, she tried explaining her medical condition, which required the corset. Feeling “violated” during this process, De Los Santos reportedly touched an airport official’s arm, a gesture that escalated into accusations of “assault and insult.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The altercation’s aftermath was swift and severe. Despite paying a fine of AED 10,000 ($2,722 USD), De Los Santos received a year-long jail sentence. Her original flight on July 15 came and went without her. Furthermore, the UAE’s automatic appeal process implies she could be in the country for an indefinite period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radha Stirling, chief executive of “Detained in Dubai,” emphasized the consequences of transiting through Dubai. The organization, which advocates for travelers stuck in such challenging situations in the UAE, is currently supporting De Los Santos. Stirling points out that government employees in Dubai could potentially exploit situations like these, seeking out-of-court settlements. She strongly believes that the reputation of UAE as a reliable transport and tourism hub is at stake due to incidents of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Los Santos’ next court appearance is slated for October 24. In the meantime, “Detained in Dubai” is tirelessly working to assist her. The organization, established in 2008, has previously aided US national Tierra Young Allen, known as “Sassy Trucker” on TikTok, who found herself in a similar predicament in the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For travelers, De Los Santos’ experience serves as a cautionary tale about the unforeseen complications that might arise during international transit.

Facing federal gun charges resulting from Special Counsel David Weiss’ prolonged investigation, Biden entered a not guilty plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges brought against him are weighty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during a firearm purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing inaccurate information mandatory for a federal firearms licensed dealer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collective total of potential 25 years in prison looms over Biden if convicted on all counts, alongside a hefty fine of $250,000 for each charge and the possibility of three years under supervised release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severity of the charges, Biden maintains his innocence. Magistrate Judge Christopher Burke, who oversaw the arraignment, has set specific conditions for Biden’s release. These include seeking employment, transparency about international travel plans, abstinence from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and mandatory participation in a drug counseling program. Notably, Biden passed a drug test during the hearing, addressing concerns about potential substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s defense attorney, disclosed plans to file a motion to dismiss based on a diversion agreement related to the gun charges, asserting its continued validity. This agreement was initially part of a plea deal to address misdemeanor tax counts, which disintegrated in July. As a result, Biden had no choice but to plead not guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and a felony gun charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recent appearance in court revolves around allegations from 2018. The indictment claims that Biden, while acquiring a Colt Cobra 38SPL Revolver, dishonestly asserted on Form 4473 that he wasn’t unlawfully using or addicted to any narcotic or controlled substance, a statement the authorities contend was false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defense appears ready to challenge the charges on several fronts, including the validity and constitutionality of the implicated statutes, it’s evident that this legal battle is just heating up.

She described the technology-driven imitation as a “horrendous Frankensteinian monster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood community, ever adapting to technological progress, recently encountered a controversial application of AI — recreating voices of actors, especially those who’ve passed away. The trend touched a nerve with Zelda, who articulated her disapproval in an impassioned Instagram Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She highlighted her unique standpoint, writing, “I am not an impartial voice in SAG’s fight against AI,” referencing the screen actors union. Zelda emphasized the ethical concerns, stating, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the impersonation of Robin’s voice might unsettle fans, the broader issue at hand extends beyond personal sentiments. “I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want,” Zelda remarked, pointing out the deeper implications of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelda’s main contention is with the principle behind the act. She believes that living actors “deserve a chance to create characters with their choices, to voice cartoons, to put their HUMAN effort and time into the pursuit of performance.” Using AI, she argues, can lead to shallow reproductions that lack the depth, emotion, and nuance that human actors bring to their roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her pointed critique, she described AI simulations of actors as being, “at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a lone outcry. Other prominent figures in Hollywood, like James Cameron, Christopher Nolan, and Tim Burton, have previously expressed reservations about such technology. Their combined voices raise a significant question about the industry’s future direction and the ethical considerations of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to push boundaries, Hollywood, and the world at large, will need to grapple with the moral quandaries it presents. Zelda’s candid remarks shed light on an issue that’s bound to grow more prominent in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Zelda Williams, daughter of the beloved late actor Robin Williams, has publicly criticized the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) to emulate her father’s distinctive voice. She described the technology-driven imitation as a “horrendous Frankensteinian monster.” The Hollywood community, ever adapting to technological progress, recently encountered a controversial application of AI — recreating voices of actors, especially those who’ve passed away. The trend touched a nerve with Zelda, who articulated her disapproval in an impassioned Instagram Story. She highlighted her unique standpoint, writing, “I am not an impartial voice in SAG’s fight against AI,” referencing the screen actors union.

The entrepreneur, who was one of the most significant donors to the Democratic Party during the 2021-2022 election cycle, has fervently entered a not-guilty plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young crypto magnate is accused of using embezzled customer funds for personal endeavors ranging from buying luxurious real estate properties in the Bahamas to making generous donations to U.S. political campaigns. Some reports indicate that “straw” donors were employed to obscure the real origin of the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing a whopping total of seven charges, if convicted, Bankman-Fried could be looking at a maximum sentence of up to 110 years behind bars. Representing him in this intense legal skirmish is the acclaimed law firm, Cohen &amp;amp; Gresser. Mark Cohen, a renowned defense attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, leads the charge. Cohen’s previous clients include high-profile names such as Ghislaine Maxwell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging into Bankman-Fried’s expected defense tactics, it seems he might argue that FTX’s Terms of Service had no clauses preventing the exchange from utilizing customer funds, provided users could still withdraw their money. The crypto entrepreneur has recognized some shortcomings in risk management but strongly refutes allegations of stealing funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial, which has been receiving extensive media coverage over the past year, has sparked widespread interest. When U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan initiated the juror examination process, it became clear that many were already familiar with the case’s details. Sources like the Joe Rogan podcast and personal losses on investments in FTX were cited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer to this riveting trial, some FTX bigwigs, co-founders Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have already admitted to fraud charges and are working with the authorities against Bankman-Fried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A peculiar twist to this case is the revelation that Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam’s younger brother and an influential lobbyist for FTX, had aspirations of buying the Pacific island of Nauru. Reports suggest that they intended this island as a potential safe haven in a doomsday scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this high-stakes trial, Bankman-Fried remains under lock and key at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. This decision followed allegations of witness intimidation, which led to his bail being revoked last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case unfolds, all eyes are on the courtroom to see how this drama culminating from the world of crypto, politics, and alleged fraud schemes pans out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a turn of events closely watched by the cryptocurrency world, FTX Exchange’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, began his trial on charges of a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme.

Kevin McCarthy found himself ousted from his esteemed position as the House Speaker, a maneuver primarily orchestrated by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. This surprising event was the result of Gaetz’s grievances against McCarthy’s leadership and decisions - sentiments that were evidently shared by several in the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy, in his first press briefing post-ouster, pointedly remarked on the motivations behind these hardline Republicans, led by Gaetz. “They are not conservatives,” McCarthy stated, referring to Gaetz’s cohort. He vehemently criticized their voting patterns, highlighting their opposition to major legislative items like the National Environmental Policy Act reform and border security. For McCarthy, their decisions were less about conservatism and more about discontent and disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s criticisms weren’t baseless. In the days leading up to this dramatic outcome, Gaetz, alongside other hardline conservatives and 208 House Democrats, successfully introduced a motion to vacate McCarthy from his position as House Speaker. Gaetz’s reasons were clear: he accused McCarthy of breaking promises, a sentiment echoed by Democrats who chastised McCarthy for his perceived “lack of interest in bipartisanship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In defense of his decisions, McCarthy argued that his primary aim as Speaker was to ensure the government remained operational. He emphasized the measures he took to achieve this end, including presenting a short-term spending bill, termed a continuing resolution (CR). This CR, which kept the government functioning for an additional 45 days, was aimed at preventing a government shutdown and giving lawmakers a cushion to prepare 12 individual spending bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this decision was met with stern opposition, especially from hardliners. An unexpected voice of dissent was Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., one among the eight GOP lawmakers who supported McCarthy’s removal. McCarthy, seemingly taken aback by her stance, remarked, “Nancy Mace is a whole other story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this political tug-of-war, Democrats took a step back, signaling their disinclination to aid McCarthy. Echoing this sentiment, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., commented on the need for Republicans to resolve their internal disputes, highlighting the apparent “House Republican Civil War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this saga was clear - McCarthy, once a towering figure in the House, found his position untenable. While the reasons for his ouster varied, from perceived broken promises to a lack of bipartisanship, the alliance of hardline Republicans and Democrats was the definitive factor in his stunning fall.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a sudden political twist, Rep.

Wall Street’s investors, as cited by The Wall Street Journal, are casting a skeptical eye, pointing to what they describe as “hopeless economics” for these services. But what does this mean for the average consumer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-oversaturated-market&quot;&gt;An Oversaturated Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming services might be today’s trend, but there’s a glaring problem: overproduction. Hollywood pumps out over 300 new TV shows annually. Surprisingly, around 290 of them don’t resonate with viewers, leading to enormous monetary losses on content that’s left unseen. With the latest writer’s contract in play, insiders predict that the number of scripted shows could potentially drop by a third in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-viewership-numbers-close-to-the-chest&quot;&gt;Keeping Viewership Numbers Close to the Chest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an industry that thrives on numbers, streaming services have surprisingly resisted revealing their viewership data. Despite writers pushing for transparency, streaming giants have decided against publicizing these figures, sharing only aggregate data with the Writers’ Guild. The reluctance to disclose such information could be attributed to a fear that poor viewership numbers might adversely impact stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consolidation---the-next-step&quot;&gt;Consolidation - The Next Step?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a multitude of streaming services vying for attention, the market’s future might lie in “consolidation.” Think of it as a streaming package deal, where for a fixed fee, consumers get access to multiple platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and ESPN. It might sound familiar; this strategy reflects the model that cable TV followed, where viewers paid for a bunch of channels, many of which they rarely watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, critics argue that this consolidation is just a ruse to recreate the old Cable TV model, where content merit took a backseat. In the golden era of cable TV, viewers paid for multiple channels, leading to a content glut filled with ads, repetitive shows, and often biased programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-merit-based-content&quot;&gt;The Need for Merit-Based Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the glaring differences between cable TV and streaming services is the need for content merit in the latter. Consumers choose their subscriptions based on the quality and appeal of the content. Streaming platforms can’t afford to rest on their laurels, unlike the old cable TV days. If these platforms opt for bundled packages, it might allow them to slip back into the old content production patterns, leading to more generic, less engaging programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploring-free-alternatives&quot;&gt;Exploring Free Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For viewers tired of paying for content they don’t enjoy, there are alternatives like PlutoTV, FreeVee, and Tubi. These platforms offer a plethora of shows and movies, ensuring that viewers don’t need to dig into their pockets for quality entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of streaming is at a crossroads. As Hollywood grapples with the challenges of producing engaging content and staying profitable, viewers should be cautious.
