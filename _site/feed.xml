A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Devious Letters Reveal Utah Author’s Plot Behind Bars</title><link href="/news/2023/09/19/Utah-Authors-Devious-Plot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Devious Letters Reveal Utah Author’s Plot Behind Bars" /><published>2023-09-19T13:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T13:03:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/19/Utah-Authors-Devious-Plot</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/19/Utah-Authors-Devious-Plot/">&lt;p&gt;A shocking revelation has emerged in the case of Kouri Richins, a Utah-based children’s book author and mother of three. Already in the public eye for allegedly poisoning her husband with a lethal cocktail, she’s now accused of attempting to fabricate evidence by urging her brother to provide a false testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-twist-in-the-tale&quot;&gt;A Twist in the Tale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summit County officials stumbled upon a six-page letter in Richins’ jail cell that was addressed to her mother, Lisa Darden. Within the letter, Richins claims her attorney, Skye Lazaro, was seeking to establish a connection linking the drugs that poisoned her husband to Mexico. She then urged her brother, Ronald “Ronney” Darden, to provide testimony about Eric Richins’ supposed trips to Mexico to purchase painkillers and the lethal drug, fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an almost flippant tone, she wrote about the need to connect the drugs to Mexico, concluding with the statement “Upon information and belief LOL.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, prosecutors firmly state there is no existing connection between Eric Richins, Mexico, and the fatal fentanyl dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-motive-for-murder&quot;&gt;A Motive for Murder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that Kouri’s motive was financial gain. Records indicate she took out four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins, her husband, amounting to over $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On the first day of 2022, months before the tragic event, she changed the beneficiary of Eric’s $2 million life insurance policy to herself, without his consent. Notably, Eric had revised his will prior to his death, removing Kouri and naming his sister as the primary beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family members expressed concerns about Kouri’s intentions, recalling Eric’s fears for his life, especially after he believed she tried to poison him twice before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple’s relationship was also strained due to financial disagreements. Kouri had aspirations of purchasing and flipping a $2 million mansion for profit, while Eric viewed it as an overly costly venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disturbing-aftermath&quot;&gt;A Disturbing Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Eric’s untimely demise, Kouri penned a children’s book titled “Are You With Me?” dealing with the theme of death. Available for $14.99 on Amazon, the book claims to assist children in navigating the complexities of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the recent discoveries, it appears there’s much more to this case than meets the eye. As investigations continue, the tragic tale of a family torn apart by greed and deception unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A shocking revelation has emerged in the case of Kouri Richins, a Utah-based children’s book author and mother of three.

&lt;p&gt;Vice News recently brought to light accusations of sexual misconduct against Ballard, an anti-child trafficking activist. At the heart of the allegations are claims made by anonymous sources, indicating that at least seven women have voiced complaints against Ballard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;murky-details-amid-a-hit-movie&quot;&gt;Murky Details Amid a Hit Movie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women, believed to be central to these allegations, either haven’t responded to or have declined to comment on the Vice report. Ballard previously stepped down from his brainchild, Operation Underground Railroad, due to a separate investigation into similar misconduct claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rather startling detail, it was alleged that Ballard persuaded women to act as his “wife” during undercover missions abroad, which were directed at rescuing sex trafficking victims. Ballard allegedly pressured these women to share a bed or even shower together, under the pretext that it was essential to deceive the traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization, Operation Underground Railroad, acknowledged the allegations by stating they’ve employed an independent law firm to thoroughly investigate these claims. This inquiry remains underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;politics-and-podcasts&quot;&gt;Politics and Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these swirling allegations, there are whispers about Ballard’s political ambitions, suggesting he might be contemplating a run for the Utah U.S. Senate seat, potentially replacing Sen. Mitt Romney (R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballard’s political leanings are also garnering attention, given his alliance with former President Trump, even featuring him on his podcast. Recently, at a public gathering, Ballard seemed to refute the Vice News accusations, stating emphatically, “It’s not true, nothing you hear is true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more. An “anonymous letter” has allegedly been making rounds within Utah’s philanthropic circles over the past few months. This letter further accuses Ballard of sexual harassment, echoing some of Vice’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cinematic-success-amid-real-life-drama&quot;&gt;A Cinematic Success Amid Real-Life Drama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, amidst all this real-world drama, &lt;em&gt;Sound of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; became a surprise hit this summer, raking in nearly $200 million domestically. This performance overshadowed several major studio releases, including Disney’s new Indiana Jones sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

The disappearance of this state-of-the-art aircraft led to an immediate search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-puzzling-disappearance&quot;&gt;A Puzzling Disappearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon investigating the incident, military officials from Joint Base Charleston revealed a significant finding. A debris field was discovered in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. However, it’s still unconfirmed whether the debris belongs to the missing F-35 jet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the pilot, during an unspecified “mishap,” safely ejected from the jet on Sunday. Fortunately, after landing on the ground, the pilot received medical attention at a nearby center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the debris discovery, Joint Base Charleston made an announcement about a shift in responsibility. The United States Marine Corps will now take charge of the ongoing investigation into this incident. The primary objective? To understand the circumstances leading to the “mishap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the safety of the local community, officials urge residents to steer clear of the area where the debris was found. With the incident currently under active investigation, further details remain scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s concerning, however, is the Marine Corps’ decision to halt operations temporarily. This two-day break will focus on discussing “aviation safety matters and best practices.” This comes on the back of three Class-A aviation “mishaps” occurring in the last six weeks. The pause will allow Marines to reevaluate and ensure proper flight procedures, maintenance standards, and overall combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

It serves to emphasize the importance of safety and operational standards, ensuring that pilots, crews, and aircraft maintain peak readiness. This measure aims to protect both the personnel and the public while preserving the Marine Corps’ status as a formidable and well-trained force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram clash, Hollywood actress Halle Berry voiced her disapproval when rapper Drake and singer SZA used a 2012 photograph of her to promote their fresh track “Slime You Out.” What’s the catch? They did it without asking her first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-slimy-situation&quot;&gt;The Slimy Situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial photo features Berry at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, where she is seen covered from head to toe in the iconic green slime. As it is customary at the Kids’ Choice Awards, celebrities often end up covered in this playful goop. But for Berry, the problem wasn’t the slime – it was its unexpected and unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, both Drake and SZA gave their fans a sneak peek of the song on their Instagram accounts, where they shared the slimed snapshot of Berry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry didn’t remain silent. On her own Instagram, she shared a mysterious message: “SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER GUY…EVEN IF YOU’RE A WOMAN!” Diving into the comments section, Berry further revealed her feelings, saying, “Didn’t get my permission,” and “That’s not cool I thought better of him!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further emphasized, “When people you admire disappoint you you have to be the bigger person and move on!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silence-from-the-stars&quot;&gt;The Silence from the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy, representatives for all three – Berry, Drake, and SZA – haven’t made any public statements addressing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly, the artwork for the song will also serve as the cover for Drake’s upcoming album, “For All The Dogs.” The rapper has also recently shared that his fans will have to wait a bit longer for his eighth studio album, now set to drop on October 6. As the entertainment world watches, only time will tell how this slimy situation unfolds.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shockwave at the Border - Former CBP Officer Jailed for Cocaine Conspiracy</title><link href="/news/2023/09/19/Cocaine-Trafficking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shockwave at the Border - Former CBP Officer Jailed for Cocaine Conspiracy" /><published>2023-09-19T08:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T08:05:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/19/Cocaine-Trafficking</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/19/Cocaine-Trafficking/">&lt;p&gt;In a stunning revelation, a former officer of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is sentenced to over a decade in prison for his involvement in a drug smuggling scheme. This incident underscores the complex challenges at the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-swift-verdict&quot;&gt;A Swift Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Posas Jr., 51, stood before U.S. District Judge Micaela Alvarez last week. The outcome? A hefty sentence of 162 months in prison followed by five years of closely watched release. This decision followed a brief trial held on June 27, where a jury took merely two hours to declare Posas guilty of plotting to traffic cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-incident&quot;&gt;The Incident&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 6, 2022, Posas met up with Alexis Soria Soria, a 25-year-old living unlawfully in the U.S., in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Weslaco, Texas. There, Soria handed over a box to Posas, which was later discovered to contain 20 kilograms of cocaine. The authorities also acquired recordings that captured the duo conversing about the drug deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Homeland Security Investigations had Posas under their radar for quite some time. They even managed to procure recorded phone calls, revealing Posas discussing drug deals for cash with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during his trial, Posas offered a surprising defense. He argued that he believed the box merely contained fruit, rather than the illicit drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-larger-picture&quot;&gt;The Larger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest and subsequent sentencing of a former CBP officer expose vulnerabilities and raise pressing questions about the integrity of those tasked with safeguarding the nation’s borders. The Rio Grande Valley remains a hotspot for both drug and human trafficking activities. Posas’ case stands as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against smuggling and the unexpected actors that can sometimes be found in its web.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a stunning revelation, a former officer of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is sentenced to over a decade in prison for his involvement in a drug smuggling scheme.

But is this truly in the best interest of the American people and domestic energy production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shift from Energy Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located north of Albuquerque in Sandoval County, the affected area spans over 4,200 acres. If this proposal is greenlit, it will not only halt new mining claims and oil and gas development for up to five decades, but it also raises questions on the United States’ commitment to energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who previously pushed for similar actions while in Congress, defended the move. “Today we’re responding to calls from Tribes, elected leaders, and community members who want to see these public lands protected,” she commented. Haaland emphasized the importance of these lands for their cultural significance and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Cost of the Ban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the protection of natural habitats and historical sites is important, it’s equally crucial to consider the country’s energy needs and the potential economic implications of such bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the region possesses a high potential for sand and gravel extraction, which plays a pivotal role in infrastructure projects like roads. By sidelining these resources, not only does the country lose out on valuable domestic energy resources, but there’s also a significant economic blow. The Congressional Budget Office reported a projected decrease of $2 million in federal revenue due to this land withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as the Biden administration maneuvers to pivot the US away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, the tangible impact of these decisions on everyday Americans is profound. With restrictions on domestic energy production, the US could see increased dependence on foreign energy sources, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy security and higher costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Question of Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intent to preserve cultural resources and protect Native American lands is commendable, it’s essential to strike a balance. As we have seen from past actions, including the reversal of Trump-era decisions related to fossil fuel pipelines, the current administration’s approach tends to prioritize global climate ambitions over domestic energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of energy independence and the role of domestic resources in bolstering the US economy, it’s crucial to reassess the long-term implications of such bans. Finding a middle ground that caters to both environmental and energy concerns could be the way forward, ensuring a more stable future for the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden administration recently unleashed a proposal to impose a 50-year ban on mining and oil drilling across thousands of acres in New Mexico, citing protection of wildlife, cultural resources, and Native American lands as reasons.

&lt;p&gt;A senior GOP figure has been forthright, indicating a significant lack of Republican support for such a sizable aid package. Their stance underscores a broader GOP viewpoint that emphasizes scrutinizing foreign aid, especially when domestic challenges are looming large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting Americans First?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Stern, the director of the Heritage Foundation’s budget center, underscored the weight of the proposed aid by putting it in relatable terms: the $24 billion aid equates to an alarming $1,100 per American household. To offer some perspective, a 2022 Federal Reserve study found that an unsettling 37% of Americans are ill-equipped to handle a sudden $400 emergency expense. This statistic, up from 32% just a year ago, sheds light on the financial strain many households are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to allocate such extensive funds to Ukraine becomes even more jarring when considering Biden’s recent pledge to provide a one-time $700 relief payment to Maui fire survivors, which is notably less than the proposed per household aid amount for Ukraine. A recent CNN poll further backs the GOP’s concerns, revealing that 55% of Americans believe Congress should refrain from dispatching additional aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP Voices Grow Louder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One senior GOP lawmaker expressed skepticism about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner’s (R-OH) remarks that Zelensky could sway reluctant Republicans. Dismissing it, the lawmaker humorously stated, “when Turner’s pet unicorn has offspring, I’d like to buy one of the colts,” before getting to the heart of the matter: “We do not have the votes in the Republican conference to do any Ukraine funding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that while Ukraine seeks more financial assistance, there have been significant internal shakeups, with six of its deputy defense ministers recently being let go after the dismissal of Minister Oleksii Reznikov due to a corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of such critical domestic financial challenges and the need for accountability in foreign nations seeking assistance, the GOP’s cautious approach to Ukraine’s aid request resonates as both sensible and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky gears up to lobby for further aid this Thursday, GOP members of the House are voicing valid concerns about the hefty $24 billion military and economic aid proposal championed by President Joe Biden.

Matthew Richards, 41, stands accused of attempting to kill his wife and five children in their home. Following the alleged attack, he is also charged with attempting to set the residence on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disturbing-details&quot;&gt;Disturbing Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harrowing incident occurred on September 16, when emergency services responded to alerts of a disturbance and fire around 3:47 a.m. Upon arriving, firefighters tackled a blaze in the basement of the family home located on Goode Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richards and all the victims were rushed to the hospital. According to the Shawnee Police Department’s press release, the five children and the wife sustained “laceration injuries of varying degrees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath has left Richards with five counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder and one count of aggravated arson with a risk of bodily harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-unexpected-turn&quot;&gt;An Unexpected Turn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crossroads Christian Church, where Richards was employed, showcases a heartwarming biography of him on their website. He is described as “a big kid who loves teaching little kids about Jesus.” The biography paints a contrasting picture, highlighting his marriage to Stephanie since 2003, their five children, and the family’s three rules – emphasizing love for God, people, and sports.&lt;/p&gt;
