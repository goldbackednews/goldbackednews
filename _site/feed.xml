A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Shockwaves in Animation - Justin Roiland Under Fire for Disturbing Allegations</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/15/Justin-Roiland-Allegations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shockwaves in Animation - Justin Roiland Under Fire for Disturbing Allegations" /><published>2023-09-15T10:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-15T10:05:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/15/Justin-Roiland-Allegations</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/15/Justin-Roiland-Allegations/">&lt;p&gt;The animation community is in turmoil following unsettling allegations against Justin Roiland, co-creator of Cartoon Network’s renowned series ‘Rick and Morty’. As the world absorbs the details of the accusations, Roiland has been quick to deny the claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-praise-to-prosecution&quot;&gt;From Praise to Prosecution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrated for his contribution to the world of animation, Roiland’s public image is being overshadowed by a wave of accusations, including sexual assault and inappropriate interactions with underage fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, he faced charges of felony domestic violence against an ex-girlfriend, which were eventually dismissed due to a lack of evidence. However, the repercussions were palpable, with the acclaimed animator being shown the door from ‘Rick and Morty’, the very show that cemented his status in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-than-just-words&quot;&gt;More Than Just Words?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recently published NBC News report has further ignited the controversy. Based on testimonies from 11 individuals, including women and gender “nonbinary” persons, the report sheds light on the alleged inappropriate conversations Roiland engaged in over various platforms from 2013 to 2022. A disturbing pattern emerges, with three interviewees claiming they were just 16 when the exchanges took a sexual turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly harrowing account from a woman suggests that after a Tinder interaction in 2019, Roiland, despite being aware of her age, bought her alcohol and later attempted to force her into a sexual act. Although Roiland has labeled these allegations as “false and defamatory”, the testimonies continue to mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-traces&quot;&gt;Digital Traces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBC report provides evidence in the form of text messages that appear to display a lack of awareness or remorse on Roiland’s part. Disturbingly, he even used the term “jailbait” in reference to 16-year-olds, making light of their age and making suggestive comments about their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contested-accounts-and-clouded-memories&quot;&gt;Contested Accounts and Clouded Memories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further accounts detail a troubling encounter in Los Angeles involving Roiland, another woman, and a hot tub. Memories of this incident are patchy, but the implications remain deeply unsettling. In defense, Roiland’s attorney has presented a narrative suggesting consensual relations, attempting to distance the animator from any blame regarding the subsequent events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-shattered-image&quot;&gt;A Shattered Image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revelations surrounding Justin Roiland have sent shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry, prompting discussions about power dynamics, consent, and the responsibility of public figures. As the debate rages on, it is clear that the world of animation will never view Justin Roiland in the same light again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The animation community is in turmoil following unsettling allegations against Justin Roiland, co-creator of Cartoon Network’s renowned series ‘Rick and Morty’.

With the potential for a sentence reaching up to 25 years in prison, the consequences are significant. This comes amid an already shaky political climate where President Biden himself is under the magnifying glass due to a formal impeachment inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Counts, One Impending Storm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s indictment is not simple. It encompasses three criminal counts, each carrying its own weight of potential penalties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm. If convicted, this alone could see Hunter facing up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A deceptive statement related to records essential for a federal firearms dealer. Conviction here could culminate in a five-year prison term, another $250,000 fine, and an additional three years under supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances. This count can land him another decade in prison, with an equivalent fine and supervision period as the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aggregated, the potential consequences are daunting: a quarter of a century behind bars and fines totaling $750,000. Overseeing this intricate case is Special Counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Deals and a Father Under Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indictment follows Hunter’s plea agreement’s collapse earlier this year. Back in July, Hunter was on track to plead guilty to two misdemeanors related to tax evasion in a bid to eschew incarceration on a more serious gun-related felony charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as Hunter’s legal woes continue to unravel, President Biden isn’t immune to scrutiny. A formal impeachment inquiry is underway, spurred by “serious and credible allegations into President Biden’s conduct,” as articulated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden’s Lawyer Strikes Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these charges, Hunter’s legal counsel, Abbe Lowell, retaliated, condemning the “MAGA Republicans’ improper and partisan interference in this process”. He suggested that the charges lodged, which the prosecutors deemed unwarranted merely six weeks ago, stem from a politically-driven shift rather than a genuine pursuit of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell maintains that Hunter, who held an unloaded gun for less than two weeks, was no threat to public safety. In contrast, he posits that a prosecutor succumbing to political pressures endangers the very fabric of the justice system. Leveraging an earlier agreement with the prosecutors and recent federal court rulings, Lowell is confident of demonstrating Hunter’s innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Looming Shadow on the Biden Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the President contends with the whispers of impeachment and his son faces these grave charges, one thing becomes clear: the Biden legacy is under significant threat. With the nation watching intently, how this drama unfolds could shape the course of American politics for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden family finds itself in turbulent waters again as Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, stands indicted on federal firearm charges.

This overt criticism not only underscores Trump’s tenacious grip on conservative narratives but also showcases the deep-seated partisanship that continues to dominate American politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump on Hunter’s Charges: The Tip of the Iceberg?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s recent post on Truth Social succinctly encapsulated his stance on the matter: “This, the gun charge, is the only crime that Hunter Biden committed that does not implicate Crooked Joe Biden. One down, Eleven to go!” With this remark, the former President alludes to eleven other allegations made by Republican lawmakers concerning Hunter Biden’s purported tax and money laundering crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cementing his position, Trump lamented the Democrats’ actions, equating them to opening a “Pandora’s Box” that might spell doom for the very fabric of the country. In his words, “The Democrats, with all of their horrible, very unfair, and mostly illegal Witch Hunts, have started a process that is very dangerous for our Country… SO SAD!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debunking the “Neutral” Prosecutor Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer to this complicated saga, Trump highlighted the role of David Weiss, the Department of Justice special counsel who announced the indictment against Hunter Biden. Contrary to the mainstream media and Democrats’ narrative that portrayed Weiss as a Trump-appointed neutral figure, the former President shed light on a deeper connection. “Prosecutor Weiss is appointed by the 2 Democrat Senators of Delaware under Blue Slip!” Trump revealed, thus exposing the longstanding Senate policy known as the “blue slip”, which allows senators from the home state to greenlight presidential appointments of U.S. attorneys and judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that Weiss has been on Hunter Biden’s case for alleged tax evasion and gun charges since 2018. A potential plea deal was once on the table, which would have granted Hunter immunity from jail time and further prosecution. However, this deal, which smells suspiciously of privilege and nepotism, foundered when Delaware U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika declined to endorse it. Following this, in a twist, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Weiss as special counsel in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling a Political Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s indictment brings to the forefront a plethora of unanswered questions about the Biden family’s dealings, especially in the context of the former Vice President and current President Joe Biden. The murkiness surrounding these allegations, combined with the intense scrutiny and criticism from conservative quarters led by influential figures like Trump, calls for transparent investigations.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-silent-compromise&quot;&gt;The Silent Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaacson’s biography paints a picture of Musk as a leader seemingly willing to compromise core values for the sake of business continuity. During a conversation with journalist Bari Weiss, Musk’s cautious stance on China, especially concerning his management of Twitter, raised eyebrows. Instead of championing free speech and human rights, Musk hinted at tempering Twitter’s language to safeguard Tesla’s foothold in the massive Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Musk’s reticence did not end there. When confronted about China’s widely-condemned treatment of the Uyghurs, he ambiguously stated that the issue had “two sides.” This seeming equivocation casts a shadow on Musk’s integrity, suggesting his views may be tainted by his vested business interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-alarming-pledge&quot;&gt;An Alarming Pledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s recent move to endorse China’s “core socialist values” further underscores Musk’s unsettling willingness to appease the Chinese Communist Party. This commitment, unprecedented for a non-Chinese company, earned him plaudits from Chinese officials. However, it simultaneously drew sharp criticism globally, with many viewing it as an alarming indication of Musk’s readiness to overlook glaring human rights violations in pursuit of profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Musk’s vocal support for the controversial reunification of Taiwan with China only compounds these concerns, leading many to question where Musk’s true loyalties lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsettling-admiration-for-an-authoritarian-regime&quot;&gt;Unsettling Admiration for an Authoritarian Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Musk’s seemingly effusive praise for China’s work ethics and business acumen has not gone unnoticed. While there’s no denying China’s prowess in the business domain, Musk’s overt admiration, especially in light of recent developments, raises suspicions about whether his comments are genuine or simply a ploy to curry favor with the authoritarian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk’s recent disclosures, as portrayed in Isaacson’s biography, lay bare the uneasy relationship between global business interests and political ethics. While business leaders often have to navigate complex political landscapes, the extent to which Musk seems willing to bend in the face of China’s communist pressure is both startling and concerning.

He cancelled an upcoming performance in Knoxville, Tennessee, in response to the venue’s alleged sharp ticket price increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Anthony was catapulted into the spotlight after his politically-infused track, “Rich Men North of Richmond,” became an internet sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue, Anthony voiced his disappointment on Facebook, explaining his intentions for keeping his shows budget-friendly. “These are supposed to be affordable shows,” he emphasized, adding, “It’s also horses— that they’re charging extra for VIP meet and greet. Those are supposed to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of exorbitant concert ticket prices, Anthony’s commitment to affordability is refreshing. Moreover, he shed light on allegations made by the venue, Cotton Eyed Joe, which claimed Anthony was demanding $120,000 for his performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the record straight, the singer detailed, “The most I’ve ever made on a show is $35,000. We’ve done two shows in NC that were completely free, and have another free show scheduled September 23rd in Kentucky for a cancer benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/720/405/oliver-anthony_01.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Oliver Anthony interacting with fans&quot; /&gt;(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Anthony expressed his frustrations with the venue’s alleged misleading claims, he also acknowledged his responsibility in the matter. “All the fault ultimately is with me. I should have been more thoroughly involved in the booking, and I should probably consider using a professional consultant in this area,” he admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fans of the country sensation need not be dismayed. Oliver Anthony has already arranged an alternate venue for his performance in Knoxville. He recently announced a new concert date at the Knoxville Convention Center on September 29, promising an affordable and fun-filled evening for his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not every day that artists prioritize their fans over potential earnings, and Oliver Anthony’s actions are a testament to his dedication to his fanbase. His genuine concern and proactive response are sure to earn him even more respect and loyalty in the country music community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Country music’s rising star, Oliver Anthony, recently made waves not only for his music but also for taking a firm stance on affordable concert ticket prices. He cancelled an upcoming performance in Knoxville, Tennessee, in response to the venue’s alleged sharp ticket price increase. Last month, Anthony was catapulted into the spotlight after his politically-infused track, “Rich Men North of Richmond,” became an internet sensation. Addressing the issue, Anthony voiced his disappointment on Facebook, explaining his intentions for keeping his shows budget-friendly. “These are supposed to be affordable shows,” he emphasized, adding, “It’s also horses— that they’re charging extra for VIP meet and greet. Those are supposed to be free.” In an age of exorbitant concert ticket prices, Anthony’s commitment to affordability is refreshing. Moreover, he shed light on allegations made by the venue, Cotton Eyed Joe, which claimed Anthony was demanding $120,000 for his performance. Setting the record straight, the singer detailed, “The most I’ve ever made on a show is $35,000. We’ve done two shows in NC that were completely free, and have another free show scheduled September 23rd in Kentucky for a cancer benefit.” (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) While Anthony expressed his frustrations with the venue’s alleged misleading claims, he also acknowledged his responsibility in the matter. “All the fault ultimately is with me.

&lt;p&gt;The tragic event unfurled at Alabama’s Cheaha State Park, when Adam Simjee, 22, and his girlfriend, Mikayla Paulus, heeded Hider’s fabricated plea for help with her supposedly broken down XB Scion. The innocent students were unaware that Hider’s car issue was an elaborate ploy; the Scion had malfunctioned weeks prior. The unsuspecting couple were drawn into a sinister plot of robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed in the plea agreement, a chilling confrontation ensued when Hider suddenly brandished a firearm at Simjee and Paulus, demanding their belongings. In an effort to defend both himself and Paulus, Simjee revealed his own gun. A fierce gunfight erupted between Hider and Simjee, culminating in injuries to both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drenched in shock and despair, Hider, with bullets in her abdomen and leg, expressed her regret, muttering, “It wasn’t supposed to be like this.” As the reality of the calamity became clear, an alleged associate of Hider’s, Krystal Pinkins, briefly made an appearance from the thicket, only to quickly vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulus, in the face of abject horror, frantically dialed 911, attempting to resuscitate her critically wounded boyfriend. Despite her best efforts, Simjee tragically succumbed to his injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a poignant online tribute to her fallen partner, Paulus lamented, “The rest of my life will be a love letter to him. I’ll miss you and love you forever sweet boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement’s investigations illuminated a darker, more convoluted narrative. Both suspects, Pinkins and Hider, had been leading an “off-the-grid” lifestyle in the Talladega National Forest, adjacent to the crime scene. Startlingly, they were found to have affiliations with notorious cult leader Rashad Jamal White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama further intensified when, during Pinkins’ arrest, her five-year-old son emerged brandishing a loaded firearm. The child eventually surrendered the weapon, facilitating Pinkins’ arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to FBI interrogations, Pinkins disclosed that they had entrusted Hider with the gun. Furthermore, they had attempted a similar deceit on an older woman just a day prior, which, fortunately, did not proceed as the lady declined their beckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chilling case serves as a somber reminder of the unpredictability of life and the lurking shadows behind innocent facades. Pinkins awaits her day in court, as the community mourns the loss of a young life taken too soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a chilling account of trust betrayed, Yasmine Hider, 21, has admitted guilt to the tragic murder of a Florida college student who, along with his girlfriend, had altruistically stopped to aid her under the pretense of car trouble.

Labeling it as the “logical next step”, McCarthy aims to rally the GOP’s support in a formal investigation into the numerous allegations against the Biden family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership Meeting to Decide the Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an 8 AM closed-door leadership session scheduled for Thursday, McCarthy will brief fellow House Republicans on the findings by House Oversight Committee Chair Jamie Comer (R-KY) and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH). These findings, as reported by Punchbowl News, are believed to be substantial enough to warrant a formalized impeachment inquiry to secure the Bidens’ bank records and other pivotal documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, gaining the necessary 218 House Republicans’ support for this inquiry might be a tall order. Several moderate Republicans, such as Reps. Ken Buck (Colo.) and Don Bacon (Neb.), have voiced their doubts regarding the necessity of an impeachment inquiry. Buck, speaking to MSNBC, stated, “The time for impeachment is the time when there’s evidence linking President Biden — if there’s evidence linking President Biden — to a high crime or misdemeanor. That doesn’t exist right now.” Furthermore, Bacon told Politico, “As of now I don’t support [an impeachment inquiry]. An inquiry should be based on evidence of a crime that points directly to President Biden…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Support and Allegations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrarily, many GOP members appear to be in favor of an impeachment inquiry. As Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) pointed out to CNN, the primary purpose of the inquiry would be to gather more evidence. She emphasized the need for transparency, stating, “Any piece of evidence, right or wrong, I want the American people to see all of it, whether it backs us up or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The myriad of accusations against Joe Biden range from photographs, texts, videos, audio recordings, and various testimonies. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biden family suspicious activity reports regarding wire transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Numerous pieces of communication, including emails, texts, and WhatsApp messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allegations from former business partners, including references to Joe Biden as the “big guy.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A multitude of whistleblower testimonies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video clips showcasing Joe Biden discussing the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allegations related to Biden family’s financial transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent CNN survey data illustrates a split perception among Americans. 61% believe Joe Biden was involved in his family’s business dealings with China and Ukraine, while only 38% consider him uninvolved. A meager 1% believe he was involved but acted without any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed impeachment inquiry, if green-lighted, is poised to significantly shape the political landscape. Whether it unearths groundbreaking revelations or serves as another political maneuver remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a significant political move, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is set to advocate for an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

This year, all eyes (and lenses) were on Justin Timberlake and Megan Thee Stallion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A backstage video, making its rounds on social media, captured Timberlake and Stallion deep in conversation, with Megan’s hand gestures making it a particularly animated chat. This led the rumor mill to spin tales of a possible feud between the two artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But were these speculations accurate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insiders quickly debunked the feud theory. A close source clarified to news outlets, “Meg loves Justin. She was excitedly saying they’d never met before.” A simple conversation turned misconstrued, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the age of social media clarity, both artists hopped onto TikTok, where Stallion shared a video of their interaction. Her caption? A light-hearted “I just talk with my hands lol. See ya next time @JustinTimberlake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VMAs were not just about this fleeting moment, though. Megan Thee Stallion had two nominations, but the awards evaded her this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most nostalgic and electrifying segment of the night was Timberlake’s reunion with NSYNC, as they presented the best pop video award. Memories of their first VMA win for ‘Bye Bye Bye’ flooded back, as JC Chasez reminisced, “Over 20 years ago, we were just kids when we won.”&lt;/p&gt;

This marks the second time Judge Hanen has made such a ruling, reinforcing the belief that the program might soon see its day in the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a comprehensive 40-page ruling released on Wednesday, Judge Hanen stated that there existed “no material differences” between the iteration of DACA he deemed illegal in 2021 and the amendments introduced by the Biden administration, as cited by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DACA program, conceived via an executive order by former President Barack Obama in 2012, had been legally contested by Texas and an additional eight states. Their contention lay in the belief that the program circumvented established congressional lawmaking processes, causing the states tangible harm. These grievances ultimately led Judge Hanen to label the program unconstitutional back in 2021 and once more this Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individuals protected under the DACA program, colloquially known as “Dreamers”, are safeguarded from potential deportation and can reside within the U.S. borders provided they satisfy specific criteria. These prerequisites, as outlined by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, include age restrictions, maintenance of a clean criminal record, and specific immigration status as of June 15, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of March, NBC DFW highlighted that there were approximately 578,680 individuals enrolled in the DACA program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the gravity of Wednesday’s ruling, there’s a silver lining. The Biden administration is poised to contest the judgment at the U.S. Supreme Court. Furthermore, Judge Hanen specified that the government retains the authority to process those applicants who secured their initial DACA status before his groundbreaking ruling on July 16, 2021. The catch? The Department of Homeland Security is prohibited from accepting new applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to clarify his stance, Judge Hanen emphasized, “To be clear, neither this supplemental order of injunction nor the memorandum and order that accompanies it requires DHS or the Department of Justice to take any immigration, deportation, or criminal action against any DACA recipient, applicant, or any other individual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hill recounted Judge Hanen’s awareness of the “predicament” DACA participants find themselves embroiled within due to the ongoing legal tussles. Yet, he firmly opined that the remedy to such dilemmas rests with Congress. He emphasized, “While sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients and their families, this court has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time… The solution for these deficiencies lies with the legislature, not the executive or judicial branches.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a momentous decision that could reshape immigration policy, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen once again declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program illegal.
