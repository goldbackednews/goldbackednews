A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Hunter Biden Faces Court - Gun Charges Amidst Weiss’ Investigation</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/04/Hunter-Biden-Gun-Charges/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hunter Biden Faces Court - Gun Charges Amidst Weiss’ Investigation" /><published>2023-10-04T09:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-04T09:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/04/Hunter-Biden-Gun-Charges</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/04/Hunter-Biden-Gun-Charges/">&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, DE - A legal cloud continues to hang over the first family as Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, firmly declared his innocence in a Delaware court on Tuesday. Facing federal gun charges resulting from Special Counsel David Weiss’ prolonged investigation, Biden entered a not guilty plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges brought against him are weighty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during a firearm purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing inaccurate information mandatory for a federal firearms licensed dealer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collective total of potential 25 years in prison looms over Biden if convicted on all counts, alongside a hefty fine of $250,000 for each charge and the possibility of three years under supervised release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severity of the charges, Biden maintains his innocence. Magistrate Judge Christopher Burke, who oversaw the arraignment, has set specific conditions for Biden’s release. These include seeking employment, transparency about international travel plans, abstinence from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and mandatory participation in a drug counseling program. Notably, Biden passed a drug test during the hearing, addressing concerns about potential substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s defense attorney, disclosed plans to file a motion to dismiss based on a diversion agreement related to the gun charges, asserting its continued validity. This agreement was initially part of a plea deal to address misdemeanor tax counts, which disintegrated in July. As a result, Biden had no choice but to plead not guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and a felony gun charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recent appearance in court revolves around allegations from 2018. The indictment claims that Biden, while acquiring a Colt Cobra 38SPL Revolver, dishonestly asserted on Form 4473 that he wasn’t unlawfully using or addicted to any narcotic or controlled substance, a statement the authorities contend was false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors Leo Wise and Derek Hines represented the government at the hearing, while Weiss was absent. Previous reports suggest that Hunter Biden’s firearm became a matter of public concern when it was discarded in a trash can near a Delaware school in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defense appears ready to challenge the charges on several fronts, including the validity and constitutionality of the implicated statutes, it’s evident that this legal battle is just heating up. As the story develops, its impact on the Biden family and the wider political landscape remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">WILMINGTON, DE - A legal cloud continues to hang over the first family as Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, firmly declared his innocence in a Delaware court on Tuesday.

She described the technology-driven imitation as a “horrendous Frankensteinian monster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood community, ever adapting to technological progress, recently encountered a controversial application of AI — recreating voices of actors, especially those who’ve passed away. The trend touched a nerve with Zelda, who articulated her disapproval in an impassioned Instagram Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She highlighted her unique standpoint, writing, “I am not an impartial voice in SAG’s fight against AI,” referencing the screen actors union. Zelda emphasized the ethical concerns, stating, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the impersonation of Robin’s voice might unsettle fans, the broader issue at hand extends beyond personal sentiments. “I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want,” Zelda remarked, pointing out the deeper implications of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelda’s main contention is with the principle behind the act. She believes that living actors “deserve a chance to create characters with their choices, to voice cartoons, to put their HUMAN effort and time into the pursuit of performance.” Using AI, she argues, can lead to shallow reproductions that lack the depth, emotion, and nuance that human actors bring to their roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her pointed critique, she described AI simulations of actors as being, “at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a lone outcry. Other prominent figures in Hollywood, like James Cameron, Christopher Nolan, and Tim Burton, have previously expressed reservations about such technology. Their combined voices raise a significant question about the industry’s future direction and the ethical considerations of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to push boundaries, Hollywood, and the world at large, will need to grapple with the moral quandaries it presents.

The entrepreneur, who was one of the most significant donors to the Democratic Party during the 2021-2022 election cycle, has fervently entered a not-guilty plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young crypto magnate is accused of using embezzled customer funds for personal endeavors ranging from buying luxurious real estate properties in the Bahamas to making generous donations to U.S. political campaigns. Some reports indicate that “straw” donors were employed to obscure the real origin of the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing a whopping total of seven charges, if convicted, Bankman-Fried could be looking at a maximum sentence of up to 110 years behind bars. Representing him in this intense legal skirmish is the acclaimed law firm, Cohen &amp;amp; Gresser. Mark Cohen, a renowned defense attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, leads the charge. Cohen’s previous clients include high-profile names such as Ghislaine Maxwell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging into Bankman-Fried’s expected defense tactics, it seems he might argue that FTX’s Terms of Service had no clauses preventing the exchange from utilizing customer funds, provided users could still withdraw their money. The crypto entrepreneur has recognized some shortcomings in risk management but strongly refutes allegations of stealing funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial, which has been receiving extensive media coverage over the past year, has sparked widespread interest. When U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan initiated the juror examination process, it became clear that many were already familiar with the case’s details. Sources like the Joe Rogan podcast and personal losses on investments in FTX were cited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer to this riveting trial, some FTX bigwigs, co-founders Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have already admitted to fraud charges and are working with the authorities against Bankman-Fried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A peculiar twist to this case is the revelation that Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam’s younger brother and an influential lobbyist for FTX, had aspirations of buying the Pacific island of Nauru. Reports suggest that they intended this island as a potential safe haven in a doomsday scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this high-stakes trial, Bankman-Fried remains under lock and key at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. This decision followed allegations of witness intimidation, which led to his bail being revoked last month.&lt;/p&gt;

Kevin McCarthy found himself ousted from his esteemed position as the House Speaker, a maneuver primarily orchestrated by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. This surprising event was the result of Gaetz’s grievances against McCarthy’s leadership and decisions - sentiments that were evidently shared by several in the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy, in his first press briefing post-ouster, pointedly remarked on the motivations behind these hardline Republicans, led by Gaetz. “They are not conservatives,” McCarthy stated, referring to Gaetz’s cohort. He vehemently criticized their voting patterns, highlighting their opposition to major legislative items like the National Environmental Policy Act reform and border security. For McCarthy, their decisions were less about conservatism and more about discontent and disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s criticisms weren’t baseless. In the days leading up to this dramatic outcome, Gaetz, alongside other hardline conservatives and 208 House Democrats, successfully introduced a motion to vacate McCarthy from his position as House Speaker. Gaetz’s reasons were clear: he accused McCarthy of breaking promises, a sentiment echoed by Democrats who chastised McCarthy for his perceived “lack of interest in bipartisanship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In defense of his decisions, McCarthy argued that his primary aim as Speaker was to ensure the government remained operational. He emphasized the measures he took to achieve this end, including presenting a short-term spending bill, termed a continuing resolution (CR). This CR, which kept the government functioning for an additional 45 days, was aimed at preventing a government shutdown and giving lawmakers a cushion to prepare 12 individual spending bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this decision was met with stern opposition, especially from hardliners. An unexpected voice of dissent was Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., one among the eight GOP lawmakers who supported McCarthy’s removal. McCarthy, seemingly taken aback by her stance, remarked, “Nancy Mace is a whole other story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this political tug-of-war, Democrats took a step back, signaling their disinclination to aid McCarthy. Echoing this sentiment, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., commented on the need for Republicans to resolve their internal disputes, highlighting the apparent “House Republican Civil War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this saga was clear - McCarthy, once a towering figure in the House, found his position untenable. While the reasons for his ouster varied, from perceived broken promises to a lack of bipartisanship, the alliance of hardline Republicans and Democrats was the definitive factor in his stunning fall.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a sudden political twist, Rep.

Wall Street’s investors, as cited by The Wall Street Journal, are casting a skeptical eye, pointing to what they describe as “hopeless economics” for these services. But what does this mean for the average consumer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-oversaturated-market&quot;&gt;An Oversaturated Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming services might be today’s trend, but there’s a glaring problem: overproduction. Hollywood pumps out over 300 new TV shows annually. Surprisingly, around 290 of them don’t resonate with viewers, leading to enormous monetary losses on content that’s left unseen. With the latest writer’s contract in play, insiders predict that the number of scripted shows could potentially drop by a third in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-viewership-numbers-close-to-the-chest&quot;&gt;Keeping Viewership Numbers Close to the Chest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an industry that thrives on numbers, streaming services have surprisingly resisted revealing their viewership data. Despite writers pushing for transparency, streaming giants have decided against publicizing these figures, sharing only aggregate data with the Writers’ Guild. The reluctance to disclose such information could be attributed to a fear that poor viewership numbers might adversely impact stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consolidation---the-next-step&quot;&gt;Consolidation - The Next Step?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a multitude of streaming services vying for attention, the market’s future might lie in “consolidation.” Think of it as a streaming package deal, where for a fixed fee, consumers get access to multiple platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and ESPN. It might sound familiar; this strategy reflects the model that cable TV followed, where viewers paid for a bunch of channels, many of which they rarely watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, critics argue that this consolidation is just a ruse to recreate the old Cable TV model, where content merit took a backseat. In the golden era of cable TV, viewers paid for multiple channels, leading to a content glut filled with ads, repetitive shows, and often biased programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-merit-based-content&quot;&gt;The Need for Merit-Based Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the glaring differences between cable TV and streaming services is the need for content merit in the latter. Consumers choose their subscriptions based on the quality and appeal of the content. Streaming platforms can’t afford to rest on their laurels, unlike the old cable TV days. If these platforms opt for bundled packages, it might allow them to slip back into the old content production patterns, leading to more generic, less engaging programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploring-free-alternatives&quot;&gt;Exploring Free Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For viewers tired of paying for content they don’t enjoy, there are alternatives like PlutoTV, FreeVee, and Tubi. These platforms offer a plethora of shows and movies, ensuring that viewers don’t need to dig into their pockets for quality entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of streaming is at a crossroads. As Hollywood grapples with the challenges of producing engaging content and staying profitable, viewers should be cautious. After all, it’s about value for money and getting the quality entertainment that viewers deserve. As the industry evolves, it’s up to consumers to vote with their wallets and ensure they’re getting the best bang for their buck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">The bustling digital age has not been kind to Hollywood’s big-ticket streaming platforms.

However, critics argue that this consolidation is just a ruse to recreate the old Cable TV model, where content merit took a backseat. In the golden era of cable TV, viewers paid for multiple channels, leading to a content glut filled with ads, repetitive shows, and often biased programming. The Need for Merit-Based Content One of the glaring differences between cable TV and streaming services is the need for content merit in the latter. Consumers choose their subscriptions based on the quality and appeal of the content. Streaming platforms can’t afford to rest on their laurels, unlike the old cable TV days. If these platforms opt for bundled packages, it might allow them to slip back into the old content production patterns, leading to more generic, less engaging programming. Exploring Free Alternatives For viewers tired of paying for content they don’t enjoy, there are alternatives like PlutoTV, FreeVee, and Tubi. These platforms offer a plethora of shows and movies, ensuring that viewers don’t need to dig into their pockets for quality entertainment. Final Thoughts The world of streaming is at a crossroads. As Hollywood grapples with the challenges of producing engaging content and staying profitable, viewers should be cautious. After all, it’s about value for money and getting the quality entertainment that viewers deserve. As the industry evolves, it’s up to consumers to vote with their wallets and ensure they’re getting the best bang for their buck.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Baton Rouge Police Under Fire - Inside the Controversial ‘Brave Cave’</title><link href="/news/2023/10/03/Baton-Rouge-Torture-Warehouse/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Baton Rouge Police Under Fire - Inside the Controversial ‘Brave Cave’" /><published>2023-10-03T16:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-03T16:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/03/Baton-Rouge-Torture-Warehouse</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/03/Baton-Rouge-Torture-Warehouse/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baton Rouge Faces a Tumultuous Turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) is currently mired in controversy after several alarming allegations of misconduct inside a facility colloquially known as the “Brave Cave.” The disturbing events reportedly occurring inside this so-called ‘torture warehouse’ are the subject of numerous lawsuits, one of which has been filed by a grandmother alleging “sexual humiliation” after a routine traffic stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deeper into the “Brave Cave” Allegations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRPD is enduring increasing public scrutiny following the FBI’s decision to open a civil rights investigation into the “Brave Cave.” Ternell Brown and Jeremy Lee, two of the plaintiffs, have spotlighted the notorious warehouse in their respective lawsuits filed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown claims that she experienced “sexual humiliation” after enduring unnecessary strip and body cavity searches at the facility. Lee’s case is equally harrowing. After his arrest and subsequent detention at the “Brave Cave”, he was reportedly so severely beaten that the local jail refused him entry until he received hospital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Thompson, representing Brown, mentioned to media outlets that more allegations of abuse from the “Brave Cave” continue to surface. He anticipates filing another lawsuit soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the uproar, BRPD Public Information Officer L’Jean McKneely stated that the department is taking the accusations seriously and has initiated both administrative and criminal investigations. The contentious “Brave Cave” facility has been closed, and the officers associated with it have been reassigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History and Fallout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are now asking: What was the “Brave Cave?” According to multiple sources, it served as a sort of “home base” where BRPD officers would take suspects for intensive interrogation, with the intent to gather intelligence and potentially turn them into informants. The location, which processed “thousands of suspects” over two decades, has now been shut down by Baton Rouge officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigations have exposed disturbing instances of alleged misconduct by officers, including using excessive force and conspiring to hide incriminating body camera footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Right to Justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every individual, regardless of their situation, has rights, including the right to legal representation and a fair trial. The allegations emerging from Baton Rouge are deeply troubling and raise pressing questions about the violation of these rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Attorney Anderson Dotson and the Baton Rouge Union of Police have refrained from commenting due to the ongoing legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the legal proceedings unfold, the Baton Rouge community and the nation will be closely watching. The hope is that justice will prevail, trust will be restored, and measures will be put in place to prevent any future misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Baton Rouge Faces a Tumultuous Turn The Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) is currently mired in controversy after several alarming allegations of misconduct inside a facility colloquially known as the “Brave Cave.” The disturbing events reportedly occurring inside this so-called ‘torture warehouse’ are the subject of numerous lawsuits, one of which has been filed by a grandmother alleging “sexual humiliation” after a routine traffic stop.

Trump alleges that businesses are leaving the state due to the Attorney General’s aggressive actions and said that “anybody that does business in New York State is crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trump-vs-the-big-apple&quot;&gt;Trump vs. The Big Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of Attorney General Letitia James’ civil fraud case against Trump was marked by the former president’s scathing remarks against her and the judicial process in New York. Trump’s main argument is that the state, under James, is hostile to businesses. He remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And you ought to go after this attorney general because she’s turning off everybody from coming in. Businesses are fleeing New York because of horrible, horrible attorney generals and judges like we have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;election-campaigns--personal-agendas&quot;&gt;Election Campaigns &amp;amp; Personal Agendas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump emphasized that James had used her intent to prosecute him as a selling point during her election campaign. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When you have a radical left attorney general like Letitia James…she got elected on the fact that she’s going to ‘take down President Trump.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allegation isn’t baseless. As Breitbart News reported, James had indeed promised punitive measures against Trump during her 2018 campaign, a fact noted by several publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accusations-of-racism--election-interference&quot;&gt;Accusations of Racism &amp;amp; Election Interference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump didn’t shy away from calling James a “racist attorney general”, reiterating his belief that the ongoing trial is part of a “witch hunt.” His frustrations also pointed toward the broader political scenario. Trump said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is a continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time. We have a racist attorney general who’s a horror show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former president believes the case against him is an attempt at “election interference” by parties threatened by his political presence. He underscored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple. They’re trying to damage me so that I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-glimpse-of-the-political-landscape&quot;&gt;A Glimpse of the Political Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments shed light on the tense political climate leading up to the 2024 presidential elections. Trump’s accusations against AG James, the judiciary, and the broader Democratic agenda hint at the deep divisions within the country’s political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Hauser, a 56-year-old with a history of heinous crimes, was convicted last week on kidnapping and sexual assault charges. With his sentencing set for Friday, the community anticipates a potential life sentence without parole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-predatory-offer&quot;&gt;A Predatory Offer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The female victim, who was homeless at the time, shared that on Nov. 10, 2021, Hauser had lured her with the promise of shelter in his garage. However, the initial friendly demeanor soon took a dark turn. The victim recounts that after spending some time in the garage, upon sensing discomfort and attempting to depart, she was forcefully restrained by Hauser. He bound her to his truck with a chain, leading to a weeks-long nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout her captivity, the woman stated that Hauser drugged her repeatedly, resulting in significant “memory issues.” She detailed the disturbing statements Hauser made, suggesting he was living out a sinister fantasy. “He would ask her if she wanted to be hurt… say he was going to kill her slowly, but other times would say he wanted to ‘keep’ her,” the court affidavit reveals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This terrifying ordeal finally came to an end on Nov. 28, 2021, when the victim managed to free herself due to Hauser’s carelessness, allowing her to escape and find help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-long-trail-of-crimes&quot;&gt;A Long Trail of Crimes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tacoma police apprehended Hauser on Dec. 2, 2021, after he was spotted on Walmart surveillance footage using the victim’s food stamps. His criminal history further exacerbates the alarming nature of his recent conviction. Hauser, labeled a level 3 sex offender, had previously severed his ankle monitor ties. He was also convicted in 2014 for kidnapping a minor at knifepoint, where he then administered drugs and assaulted her. Earlier in 2007, his rap sheet expanded with convictions for second-degree kidnapping involving a deadly weapon and felony harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community and the broader public eagerly await his sentencing, hoping for justice for the victim and to ensure a repeat offender like Hauser stays behind bars, preventing any more heinous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with additional information on the case is urged to get in touch with the local police.

On Monday, appearing on FNC’s “Hannity”, Graham made a bold claim regarding New York State Attorney General Letitia James’ civil suit against Trump, painting it as part of a calculated assault against the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-deliberate-strategy-against-trump&quot;&gt;A Deliberate Strategy Against Trump?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham pulled no punches, labeling the legal actions as “a systematic effort to destroy Donald Trump as a political person.” He emphasized Trump’s crime in the eyes of his adversaries: “His crime was he was a good conservative president.” Graham’s sentiments hint at an escalating animosity within the political arena, where he states, “I’ve never seen hatred toward a political figure like I see against President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;banks-insurance-and-fiscal-valuations&quot;&gt;Banks, Insurance, and Fiscal Valuations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Hannity, the anchor of the show, brought forward a valid point to the discussion. He said, “The banks got paid, the insurance companies got paid,” questioning the actual premise of the fraud case. Hannity’s sharp observation highlights the obligation of banks and insurance companies to carry out their fiduciary duties. These institutions, when entering into multi-million dollar agreements, should not solely rely on external valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grahams-call-to-action&quot;&gt;Graham’s Call to Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham’s spirited defense continued, taking aim at the judicial decision itself. He expressed his incredulity regarding the valuation of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, remarking, “The judge believes that Mar-a-Lago’s worth $18 million. What a friggin’ joke.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a stirring appeal to the audience and potential voters in key states, Graham said, “President Trump can’t be in Iowa and South Carolina and New Hampshire. But if you live in these states, you can help him by making sure that liberals do not get away with this. Vote for President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;

The Senator’s fervent defense of Trump underscores the broader theme of political bias, framing the NY lawsuit as a targeted move against the former president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political climate continues to heat up with the approach of the 2024 elections, such defenses and accusations will likely play a significant role in shaping public opinion.
