A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Senator Cruz Foresees Michelle Obama’s Entry in 2024 Race</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/21/Cruz-Predicts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Senator Cruz Foresees Michelle Obama’s Entry in 2024 Race" /><published>2023-09-21T07:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-21T07:02:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/21/Cruz-Predicts</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/21/Cruz-Predicts/">&lt;p&gt;Texas Senator Ted Cruz has sparked conversations with a bold prediction: the Democrats might opt for former First Lady Michelle Obama to replace President Joe Biden for the 2024 elections. According to Cruz, the Dems are getting increasingly “nervous” about Biden’s potential run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-big-prediction&quot;&gt;The Big Prediction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his podcast, “Verdict with Ted Cruz”, the Senator voiced that the odds of Biden not getting the Democrat nomination have “risen significantly.” Citing reasons, he pointed to polling numbers indicating two-thirds of Americans believe Biden might be too old for presidency and emerging concerns about Biden’s connections and possible corruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruz did not shy away from pointing fingers at the media. According to him, their changing stance on Biden signifies the Democrats’ contemplation of a potential change in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;michelle-obama---the-unexpected-game-changer&quot;&gt;Michelle Obama - The Unexpected Game-Changer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Democratic National Convention sees Biden’s “mental diminishment” become more evident, Cruz believes the platform will serve as a launching pad for Michelle Obama. His reasoning? Bringing in Michelle Obama would not alienate African American women voters - a significant constituent for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having served as the First Lady, Cruz argues that Michelle has the leverage to bypass other top Democratic contenders and could be viewed as the Obamas’ attempt to “save the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind The Scenes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Cruz opined that former President Barack Obama might already be the unseen hand guiding the Biden administration. “I don’t think Joe Biden is the decision maker,” Cruz stated, suggesting Barack’s influential role. He warns that if media sentiment continues to turn on Biden, the chances of seeing Michelle Obama in the 2024 race could increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering a hypothetical scenario where Biden willingly steps down, Cruz joked that the Democrats might herald him as the “biggest hero” in their history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioning Democrats as being “dynastic” and “command and control”, Cruz believes Michelle already holds a superior position within the Democratic hierarchy than most contenders. He concludes by suggesting that her nomination might be the “only solution” that doesn’t lead to internal strife within the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the political arena is unpredictable, Cruz’s observations offer an intriguing perspective on the potential future of American politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Texas Senator Ted Cruz has sparked conversations with a bold prediction: the Democrats might opt for former First Lady Michelle Obama to replace President Joe Biden for the 2024 elections.

The Potential Effects of Aspartame</title><link href="/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Future Generations at Risk? The Potential Effects of Aspartame" /><published>2023-09-21T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-21T06:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects/">&lt;p&gt;Aspartame, a widespread zero-calorie sweetener, is making headlines again. A study from Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine indicates potential links between the sweetener and memory or learning challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unpacking-the-study&quot;&gt;Unpacking the Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from FSU carried out a 16-week experiment on mice. Three groups were set up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One consumed 15% of the FDA’s daily recommended maximum intake of aspartame (like drinking four 8-oz. sodas).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second group had 7% of the recommended maximum (equivalent to two 8-oz. sodas daily).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A control group only drank water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the experiment, the mice underwent maze tests. The results? Mice that consumed water found their way out much quicker than their aspartame-drinking counterparts. Those consuming aspartame did finish, but they struggled and often needed extra assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/672/378/mice-in-maze.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Mice in a Maze&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mice navigating through a maze. The aspartame consumers had a tougher time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;findings-and-concerns&quot;&gt;Findings and Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-author, Pradeep Bhide, shed light on the emotional connection between memory and learning. He emphasized the unique nature of the findings, pointing out that only the children (and not the grandchildren) of the male mice showed these effects. This suggests epigenetic changes in the sperm might be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these results in mind, Bhide proposed a more in-depth, multi-generational investigation of aspartame by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in June, the World Health Organization made waves by categorizing aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”. While industry experts refuted this claim, the WHO hasn’t touched on the cognitive implications highlighted by FSU’s recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a Washington, D.C.-based medical toxicology physician, weighed in. She remarked on the study’s implications: potential hereditary memory and learning problems stemming from even minimal aspartame consumption. But she also added a note of caution, stating more research is necessary to firmly establish this connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-drink-or-not-to-drink&quot;&gt;To Drink or Not to Drink?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry leaders have stepped forward to defend aspartame. The Calorie Control Council’s president, Robert Rankin, emphasized that the study’s results should not be generalized to humans. He cited the vast body of evidence and global health organizations that deem aspartame safe after rigorous evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the debate rages on, the FSU study has certainly added a new layer to the conversation surrounding artificial sweeteners and their potential effects. As research continues, consumers might consider limiting their intake or staying updated with the latest findings to make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Aspartame, a widespread zero-calorie sweetener, is making headlines again.

On Tuesday, he reintroduced the “Protecting the Right To Keep and Bear Arms Act”. This legislation, if passed, would restrict the president and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using public health emergencies as a means to enforce gun control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-amendment-under-fire&quot;&gt;Second Amendment Under Fire?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris recently expressed her support for the Second Amendment on “The Jennifer Hudson Show”. However, her endorsement for an assault weapons ban in the same conversation has raised eyebrows among conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Michael Cloud has expressed concern over the strategies of the ‘radical left’. “For a long time, radical left politicians have been open about their willingness to use executive authority and rob Americans of their Second Amendment rights,” Cloud stated, pointing out the need for his reintroduced bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for such statements and actions is clear. Last week, New Mexico’s Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, declared gun violence as a public health crisis and attempted to implement a 30-day prohibition on carrying firearms in public spaces and on state-owned properties in Albuquerque. Cloud did not hold back in his criticism, “The Biden administration, Gov. Grisham, and others have exercised extraordinary executive power to push their liberal agenda and expand the power of the government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-response&quot;&gt;The Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grisham’s bold move faced swift resistance. A judge promptly blocked the proposed 30-day gun ban. In turn, Grisham adjusted her rule to limit firearms at public parks or playgrounds, specifically mentioning areas “where we know we have high risk of kids and families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, including Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, have voiced their concerns. Johnston noted that Grisham’s utilization of a ‘public health emergency’ to suspend the Second Amendment is a troubling instance of officials potentially misusing ‘emergency powers’ to infringe on constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these concerns, Rep. Pete Sessions and Rep. Mary Miller have also shown their support for Cloud’s bill, emphasizing the importance of preserving the rights of gun owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigger-picture&quot;&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time gun violence has been referred to as a “public health crisis.” Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra used the term after a mass shooting in Atlanta. Prior to that, officials in California had made similar appeals to label gun violence as a public health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

His lawyers stated on Tuesday that he intends to plead not guilty to federal gun charges recently levied against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-charges&quot;&gt;The Charges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These charges, emerging from Special Counsel David Weiss, accuse Biden of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing an inaccurate statement linked to information that federal firearms dealers are mandated to keep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in possession of a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Hunter Biden’s legal team requests his initial court appearance be virtual, they emphasize that Biden isn’t asking for any special treatment. Since his initial plea deal crumbled earlier this year, Biden has complied with all legal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;past-controversies&quot;&gt;Past Controversies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Hunter Biden has faced legal complications. In a previously reported incident from 2018, a gun owned by Hunter was found discarded in a trash can outside a Delaware market. This gun was reportedly thrown away by Hallie Biden, widow of President Biden’s late son, Beau. Notably, Hunter had been romantically linked with Hallie at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox News also revealed that Hunter had answered “no” on a firearm transaction report when queried if he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” However, it’s essential to recall that Hunter was dismissed from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-political-storm&quot;&gt;A Political Storm?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, stated that this gun-related case poses a greater threat to the justice system than to public safety, hinting at political motivations behind the charges. Lowell declared, “Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety, but a prosecutor bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

The victim, a 40-year-old man from Houston, was found beaten to death in a backyard in the Loma Bonita neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maverick County Sheriff, Tom Schmerber, revealed the disturbing details of the crime scene on Cotorra Street and Progresso Avenue. The chilling incident unfolded on a Monday morning, around 9:30 a.m. While the Sheriff held back from divulging extensive details due to the ongoing investigation, other sources in law enforcement indicated that the property where the crime took place had previous ties to migrant smuggling activities.

With the investigation still in progress under Maverick County Sheriff Schmerber’s guidance, this event stands as a stark reminder of the intricate challenges border towns are confronting, further magnifying the ongoing debate about immigration and national security policies.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Innovative or Controversial? - AI Chatbot Assists with Abortion Information</title><link href="/news/2023/09/20/AI-Abortion-Chatbot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Innovative or Controversial? - AI Chatbot Assists with Abortion Information" /><published>2023-09-20T14:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-20T14:02:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/20/AI-Abortion-Chatbot</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/20/AI-Abortion-Chatbot/">&lt;p&gt;In a tech-meets-healthcare development, a new AI chatbot named “Charley, The Abortion Chatbot” is designed to guide pregnant women and teens towards abortion services. Developed by Cecile Richards and Tom Subak, two former officials from Planned Parenthood, the chatbot aims to offer private and precise information about abortion, but not without its share of criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon visiting the National Women’s Health Network website, users are greeted by Charley saying, “Hi, my name’s Charley. I can help you get an abortion. Let’s get started.” The platform ensures user privacy, requesting only the date of the user’s last menstrual cycle and their state of residence. In its guidance, it covers topics like nearest abortion providers, how minors can seek an abortion without parental consent, and details about mail-order abortion drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone views Charley as a helpful tool. E.V. Osment, the vice president of SBA Pro-Life America, expressed concerns to the Washington Examiner, stating that such platforms could endanger lives and potentially promote illegal activities. A run-through of Charley by the Examiner revealed that it provided out-of-state options with fewer restrictions for users based in Virginia. For Mississippi users, the chatbot even suggested leaving the country or heading to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where passports aren’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-founders Richards and Subak envision Charley being integrated into various medical and abortion clinic websites across the nation. Nicole Cushman, the content manager for Charley, shed light on their motivation: “Our research showed that people were turning primarily to Google for information about abortion options in the post-Roe landscape and that it was very challenging for abortion seekers to connect to available options.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of Charley underscores a growing intersection of technology and healthcare, with the ongoing debate around abortion only intensifying the scrutiny of such platforms. As with many tools of this nature, the line between empowerment and controversy remains thin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a tech-meets-healthcare development, a new AI chatbot named “Charley, The Abortion Chatbot” is designed to guide pregnant women and teens towards abortion services.

Contrary to the assertions of several Democrats and media outlets that there’s no basis for the inquiry, a plurality of voters believe there’s indeed evidence pointing to Biden’s wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Opinion Speaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Morning Consult poll released on Tuesday, a plurality of respondents (43-41 percent) stated that the main thrust behind the impeachment inquiry stems from genuine evidence of Biden’s transgressions. This sentiment isn’t limited to any one demographic; a plurality of independent voters (40-39 percent) share the same viewpoint. Notably, a significant 74 percent of Republican voters agree with the rationale behind the impeachment inquiry, even if just 16 percent of Democrats feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings seem to showcase a predominant narrative – that the GOP is successfully making a case for Biden’s impeachment in the court of public opinion. Statements from the White House, numerous Democrats, and media allies have been outright dismissive of the inquiry, emphasizing a lack of evidence. Yet, House Republicans have spotlighted various alleged pieces of evidence, including photos, videos, texts, and testimonies, implicating Biden in the controversy surrounding his family’s business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Consensus on Impeachment Inquiry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further dissecting the poll’s data reveals another telling aspect: nearly half of the surveyed voters (48 percent) are in favor of the impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, 42 percent are against it, and 10 percent remain on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;47 percent of independent voters back the inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;36 percent of Democrats are in support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A mere 31 percent of Republicans oppose the inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate a general consensus, even among Democrats, that the impeachment inquiry is at the very least warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Biden and the Democrats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning Consult’s analysis suggests that these findings should ring alarm bells for Biden and the Democratic party. For comparison, Democrats were less resistant to the idea of impeaching President Donald Trump in 2019 regarding his approach to Ukraine. Almost half of the Democrats believe either Biden committed an impeachable offense or he has demonstrated unfitness to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the ongoing saga seems to be benefiting Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, who, despite facing challenges within the GOP, is now in the limelight due to the impeachment proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the perception of Biden’s impeachment inquiry underscores the prevailing sentiment among voters. While many within the media and the Democratic party may downplay the legitimacy of the inquiry, a significant portion of the electorate feels otherwise. As the proceedings unfold, it remains to be seen how this perception might shape Biden’s presidency and the broader political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">A recent poll has unveiled a startling revelation regarding the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Epps, the acting president of Temple University, collapsed on stage during a memorial service on Tuesday. She was immediately rushed to the hospital but was sadly pronounced dead upon arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epps, 72, was attending a service in honor of Charles L. Blockson, a significant figure associated with the Blockson Collection at the university. The unexpected incident has sent shockwaves through the Temple University community and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a heartfelt statement released by the university, the extent of her impact was clear. “President Epps was a devoted servant and friend who represented the best parts of Temple. She spent nearly 40 years of her life serving this university, and her loss will reverberate through the community for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of her demise has not been disclosed yet. Temple University Provost, Gregory Mandel, visibly shaken by the event, commented on Epps, saying, “We are all in deep grief and at a loss for words. To know Joanne is to be her friend. She was one of the most remarkably compassionate and caring individuals I’ve ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epps had a longstanding and influential role within Temple University. Prior to her position as acting president, she served as the dean of the university’s law school and later as provost. Her rise to the role of acting president came in the wake of the resignation of Jason Wingard, Temple’s first Black president. Reflecting on her journey, Epps had shared with local news, “I would never have imagined even becoming a professor at Temple, let alone being in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania’s Governor, Josh Shapiro, paid his respects by referring to Epps as a “powerful force and constant ambassador for Temple University for nearly four decades.” Expressing his grief on X (previously known as Twitter), he mentioned how this loss deeply impacts not just the university, but the entire city of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As acting president, Epps had been actively addressing vital concerns, notably focusing on the university’s enrollment and challenges tied to rising crime near the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Temple University, Philadelphia, and the broader academic community grapple with this tragic loss, the legacy and contributions of JoAnne A.
