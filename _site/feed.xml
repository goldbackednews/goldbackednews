A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Showstopper Illness - Guns N’ Roses Postpones Concert</title><link href="/entertainment/2023/09/11/Guns-N-Roses-Concert-Postponed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Showstopper Illness - Guns N’ Roses Postpones Concert" /><published>2023-09-11T09:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-11T09:03:00-04:00</updated><id>/entertainment/2023/09/11/Guns-N-Roses-Concert-Postponed</id><content type="html" xml:base="/entertainment/2023/09/11/Guns-N-Roses-Concert-Postponed/">&lt;p&gt;In an unforeseen twist, rock legends Guns N’ Roses have postponed their highly-anticipated St. Louis concert scheduled for September 9 due to a reported illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unplugged Due to Illness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an official statement shared on their Instagram, the band relayed the unfortunate news, “Gunners, the concert in St. Louis on September 9 stands postponed due to illness. Please hold on to your tickets. Those unable to attend the rescheduled date will receive refunds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band rounded off their announcement by expressing gratitude for the continued support from their fans, symbolized with a rose emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unwavering Fan Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unexpected setback, the band’s loyal followers, known endearingly as “Gunners,” flooded the Instagram announcement with messages of goodwill and concern. Comments ranged from fans recalling the band’s memorable New Jersey show to general well wishes, emphasizing health as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specific member affected by the illness remains unclear, the band’s iconic frontman, Axl Rose, hinted at health issues earlier in the week. Taking to X, previously known as Twitter, he remarked that he felt “a little horse,” accompanying his statement with a playful picture of a small horse, adding, “Fun night, Great Crowd!! Great Venue!! N’ great to be back!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Road Again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legendary hard rock ensemble began their ambitious Guns N’ Roses World Tour 2023 in Tel Aviv, Israel, this June. After electrifying performances spanning Europe, including shows in countries like Spain, Denmark, Germany, and the U.K., the group commenced their North American leg in August, with a stopover in Moncton, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the St. Louis concert temporarily on hold, fans eagerly await the band’s next scheduled performance at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville on September 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick reminder, the current lineup of the iconic group comprises Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Dizzy Reed, Richard Fortus, Frank Ferrer, and Melissa Reese.&lt;/p&gt;

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s (D) 30-day ban on concealed carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shocking, yet commendable act of defiance came swiftly in response to the ban which had only taken effect on Saturday, September 8, 2023. The hastily-imposed prohibition not only prevents the concealed carrying of handguns but also bars open carry, effectively disarming lawful citizens in places such as Albuquerque, located in Bernalillo County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Grisham’s rash directive targets even licensed concealed carriers. In an era where citizens are encouraged to be more self-reliant for their safety and well-being, such decrees seem wildly out of touch with the core values upon which the nation was founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D.A. Bregman, standing as a beacon for constitutional rights and the Second Amendment, stated, “As an officer of the court, I cannot and will not enforce something that is clearly unconstitutional.” He further emphasized that his office would remain dedicated to pursuing actual criminals who misuse firearms for illegal endeavors, rather than infringing upon law-abiding citizens’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoing this sentiment of upholding foundational American rights, New Mexico state rep. John Block (R) fired back at Grisham’s order, rallying for her impeachment and receiving vocal support: “Impeach and remove Lujan Grisham. We even have Elon behind us on this!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding weight to the collective rejection of this ill-conceived ban, Albuquerque police chief Harold Medina unequivocally stated that he would not be enforcing the governor’s order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching message? The people of Albuquerque, their representatives, and their law enforcement, stand united against what they see as tyranny and infringement on their constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the National Association of Gun Rights is taking the fight directly to the courts, having already filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in New Mexico against the ban. The battle for Second Amendment rights is alive and well, with Albuquerque at its forefront, championing the cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In a triumphant move for American freedoms and rights, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman declared on Saturday that he would not enforce New Mexico Gov.

The politicization of the military and the current state of the labor market, among other factors, seem to be more significant drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;declining-pool-of-potential-recruits&quot;&gt;Declining Pool of Potential Recruits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Feaver, a distinguished professor at Duke University and ex-member of the National Security Council, points out that concerns about “woke” policies have been overly emphasized. He highlights underlying problems such as the shrinking pool of eligible young Americans. Health issues, drug use, and obesity have led to a reduced pool of potential recruits compared to two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver’s recent publication, “Thanks For Your Service,” delves into the waning public trust in the military. Despite the military’s 60% public confidence as per a recent Gallup poll, this figure represents the lowest since 1997 and is a disturbing trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-at-play&quot;&gt;Politics at Play?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver believes that a significant share of the declining confidence can be attributed to politics. Claims of the military becoming “woke” have perhaps added fuel to this fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has voiced concerns over the damaging image the military has received from its critics. Wormuth highlights how criticisms surrounding a “woke military” might have inadvertently influenced recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent political figures, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have criticized the Pentagon’s newly introduced diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, suggesting that they have resulted in recruitment setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-balanced-perspective&quot;&gt;A Balanced Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s essential to strike a balance. Feaver indicates that while some progressive talking points might permeate military training, it’s only a fraction of the military’s overall training focus. The narrative of the military facing a “woke” or extremist issue may not be as pervasive as projected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver emphasizes the importance of refraining from hyperbole when discussing the military. He suggests granting the military “non-combatant immunity in the culture wars,” allowing for a more nuanced, less politically charged conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feaver underscores the broader challenges that the military faces in recruitment. The appeal of the civilian job market and the sacrifices associated with military service make recruitment inherently challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Feaver notes, politicizing the military only exacerbates an already complex issue. While adjusting rhetoric can help, a holistic approach, understanding the myriad of underlying challenges, will be crucial for the future of U.S. military recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">While claims circulate that “woke” Pentagon policies are amplifying the U.S. military’s recruitment challenge, experts suggest that the issue might be deeper and more systemic.

Ted Cruz, an unwavering voice for conservative values, faces his 2024 re-election bid with fierce determination. Recognizing the sizeable group of Democrats eager to challenge his seat, Cruz prepares to defend the GOP’s long-held stronghold in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his victory over then-Rep. Beto O’Rourke in 2018, Cruz showed that Texans remain committed to their Republican roots, even in the face of immense Democratic funding and campaign efforts. As Cruz aptly noted, following former President Donald Trump, “there is no Republican in the country that Democrats would more ardently like to unseat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Democrats are coming in with all guns blazing, with Rep. Colin Allred leading the charge. Allred’s fundraising efforts managed to exceed Cruz’s by almost $2 million in Q2 2023, showing the extent of the Democrats’ fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, history remains on the GOP’s side. Texas, a beacon of conservative governance, continues to resist turning blue, regardless of Democrats’ efforts. Cal Jillson, a renowned political science professor at Southern Methodist University, reinforced this sentiment, noting, “It’s probably not ruby red, but it’s still a red state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Democrats, once dominant in Texas from the post-Civil War era through the 1970s, have been repeatedly challenged since the 1980s. With stalwarts like the Bush family frequently representing the state, Texas has stayed red in presidential, senate, and gubernatorial elections for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent election results further underscore Texas’ conservative leanings. Although Cruz’s 2018 race and Trump’s 2020 results hinted at closer margins, the GOP has continued to triumph. For instance, in 2022, Gov. Greg Abbott asserted GOP dominance, defeating O’Rourke with a decisive near-11 point lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jillson points to the evolving nature of the GOP electorate in Texas. While the party once leaned heavily toward business-friendly conservatism, today’s GOP in Texas boasts a robust mix of social conservatives and populists, advocating more vehemently for conservative principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ever-changing political landscape, the GOP remains focused on rallying Hispanic voters, a demographic pivotal to future elections. While Democrats may tout their hold on two out of three heavily Latino districts, Republicans have begun making strides with male Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley. This trend could shape future GOP campaigns in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

Demonstrating his trademark charisma, Trump partied with an Iowa State fraternity, showcased his grill skills, and engaged with the crowd by throwing footballs, further underlining his dominant position in the 2024 GOP nomination race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a spirited pre-game event, Trump visited the Alpha Gamma Rho (AGR) agriculture fraternity house at Iowa State University in Ames. Not one to stick to convention, the former president threw footballs from a beer pong table into the waiting crowd. These candid moments were interspersed with Trump flipping burgers and posing for photographs with fraternity members, all of which undoubtedly added to his ever-growing allure among supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vivacity carried over to the game, with the crowd erupting into cheers upon Trump’s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the backdrop of these events, Trump’s stronghold on the GOP nomination seems increasingly unassailable. Recent polling by Civiqs in association with Iowa State reveals Trump holding a majority with 51% support. This places him well ahead of competitors, notably Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who stands at a mere 14% support in Iowa, despite his team’s prior emphasis on the state’s significance for his campaign. DeSantis’ team, recalibrating their stance, suggested that even a “strong second” in Iowa might suffice, with a campaign official even stating, “&lt;em&gt;I don’t think there’s a single state we have to win&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to Trump’s momentum is the recent endorsement from South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. Once seen as a potential rival for the 2024 nomination, Noem’s endorsement further solidifies Trump’s status as the frontrunner in the GOP race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what was ostensibly a day of sport, Trump adeptly blended politics and entertainment, leaving an indelible impression on Iowa’s electorate and amplifying his message for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Iowa witnessed an exuberant political spectacle on Saturday as former President Donald Trump turned a college football game into an informal campaign rally.

Facing an array of legal challenges, including four recent indictments, the former president’s popularity within the Republican party not only remains unshaken but appears to be surging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is among those marveling at Trump’s capacity to navigate political storms with unique charisma. Huckabee expressed his admiration on Newsmax’s “The Count,” stating, “&lt;em&gt;It’s what I love about Donald Trump. It rolls right off of [him]&lt;/em&gt;.” The former governor emphasizes that Trump’s resilience is an asset for the Republicans, especially since any other potential nominee would likely face similar challenges from Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Trump’s magnetism has been a subject of political discourse since his 2016 presidential bid. A testament to his appeal came from the man himself when he remarked, “&lt;em&gt;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.&lt;/em&gt;” Such brazen confidence, backed by unwavering support from his base, has reinforced Trump’s “Teflon Don” moniker, making him appear impervious to the usual political pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his presidential tenure, Trump successfully weathered two impeachments, a feat unparalleled in U.S. history. These events, coupled with the current legal challenges, seem to only amplify his political might. Polling data indicates that with every indictment, Trump’s favorability among Republicans climbs. Each legal challenge appears to fortify his image as a political maverick who consistently defies conventional political norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this perception, Trump’s active engagement on his social media platform, Truth Social, reveals a deep-seated belief in his path back to the White House. A telling post to his 6 million followers read, “&lt;em&gt;I NEED ONE MORE INDICTMENT TO ENSURE MY ELECTION!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This uncanny ability to transform adversity into advantage defines Trump’s political legacy. As the 2024 elections loom, Trump’s resilience and unyielding support base position him as a formidable force in the political arena, challenging both allies and adversaries to take heed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Donald Trump’s political journey has always been emblematic of resilience.

&lt;p&gt;West Virginia’s decades-old narrative pivots around the mysterious disappearance of 10-year-old Natasha “Alex” Carter in 2000. Initial suspicions, fueled by FBI wanted posters and a $10,000 reward, landed heavily on Susan Gail Carter, her mother. Susan was believed to have abducted her daughter amidst a strained custody dispute. Evidence for these suspicions included Susan’s purported declaration to her husband, Rick Lafferty, that he’d never again see their daughter. Further, the child’s grandmother’s testimony indicated that young Natasha was fearful of her own mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the investigation’s entire trajectory shifted recently. Fresh evidence unearthed by the West Virginia State Police suggests that both mother and daughter may have vanished simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State police, along with the FBI, acted on new intelligence to execute search warrants at the Carter family’s last known Raleigh County residence. The FBI has confirmed the acquisition of “additional forensic evidence,” but details remain closely guarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry Dell Webb owned the property under investigation. Post the police’s sweep, Terry Lilly, Webb’s caretaker, allowed journalists access to the premises. The Register Herald’s accounts highlighted removed sections of drywall and extracted tile flooring, possibly hinting at concealed evidence or a grisly scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan was 41 when she vanished, while Natasha, known by her middle name “Alex,” was only 10. The duo’s disappearance took place shortly after moving in with Susan’s new spouse. West Virginia State Police’s statement clarified that what started as an alleged kidnapping by Susan Carter has now morphed into a dual missing persons case since August 8, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperate for leads, law enforcement has doubled the previous reward, now offering $20,000 for crucial information leading to the whereabouts of the Carters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the case’s national significance, “In Pursuit with John Walsh” featured it in a 2022 episode. Calls to action urge anyone with pertinent information to step forward and contact the West Virginia State Police Beckley Detachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chilling tale underscores the complexities and often unforeseen turns in long-standing cold cases.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apology Through the Lens of Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video uploaded to Instagram witnessed both Kutcher and Kunis expressing their remorse. The pair clarified that their intention was solely to support a friend they had known for 25 years, without any thought of causing harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Being aware of the pain the character letters have inflicted, we sincerely apologize,” Kutcher voiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reiterating their commitment to supporting victims of abuse, Kunis added, “Our past endeavors prove our dedication to supporting victims. This will continue to be a focus for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letters were composed in response to a plea from Masterson’s family, hoping their influence would have a bearing on the sentencing phase. Masterson was ultimately sentenced to 30 years to life for the rape of two women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kunis emphasized that the letters were never meant to question the judicial system’s legitimacy or cast doubt on the jury’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both actors expressed deep sorrow for any harm their actions may have inadvertently caused, especially if it led to the re-traumatization of victims. “We deeply regret the hurt caused and extend our sympathy to every victim of sexual assault, abuse, or rape,” the couple concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Polarizing Figure Amongst Co-stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breitbart News highlighted that Kutcher and Kunis’s letter to the judge praised Masterson as an “exceptional role model” and a beacon against drug abuse in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kutcher wrote, “Attributing my distance from the common Hollywood trap of drugs directly to Danny, he has consistently demonstrated exemplary behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Kunis lauded Masterson’s influence, describing him as a guiding light against drug abuse, emphasizing his impact on her well-being and decision-making in the entertainment realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all co-stars from “That ’70s Show” shared the couple’s sentiment. While Kurtwood Smith, Debra Rupp, and David Trainer expressed their support for Masterson, Topher Grace distinctly distanced himself. Grace’s wife, Ashley Hinshaw, posted a potent statement on Instagram, shedding light on the trauma survivors endure in such circumstances, “To every rape victim retraumatized by societal debates over the rapist’s fate, we see and recognize your pain,” she articulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles on this episode, it serves as a poignant reminder of the responsibility public figures carry and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In a recent turn of events, renowned actors and couple, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, have publicly retracted their previous endorsement for their former “That ’70s Show” co-star, Danny Masterson, after his conviction for rape.

At the recent Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson dropped a bombshell, warning of the growing left-wing bias embedded within AI’s content generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced media environment, the objectivity and quality of news are of paramount importance. However, Thomson raised concerns, painting a picture of an industry where AI’s “rubbish in, rubbish out” approach could further entrench existing biases, especially the left-leaning slant observed in certain media giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI, with its capacity to sift through and regenerate vast amounts of pre-existing content, can inadvertently proliferate and magnify any inherent biases. The CEO’s vivid depiction of the potential fallout is that of an “ever-shrinking circle of sanity surrounded by a reservoir of rubbish.” In essence, instead of embracing the potential insights AI could bring, the media landscape is at risk of turning into what he evocatively described as “maggot-ridden mind mold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond the bias, Thomson shed light on the broader implications of AI in journalism. He highlighted the disturbing decline in newsroom employment, indicating a drop of nearly 57% between 2008 to 2020. With AI poised to take a more substantial role, the livelihoods of thousands more are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomson’s solution? Accountability. He asserted that companies training generative AI using archived materials should compensate the original publishers appropriately. “If you derive benefit from our content, we should derive a benefit or else you’re in danger of undermining the creation of that content,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discourse around AI’s role in journalism, especially its political bias, is a pressing concern. As the lines between human-led journalism and AI-generated content blur, Thomson’s cautionary note is a clarion call for the industry to tread carefully, ensuring technology enhances rather than skews the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in journalism is not devoid of controversy.
