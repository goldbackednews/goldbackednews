A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump Dismisses Speaker of the House Buzz: ‘Eyes Set on the Presidency’</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/05/Trump-Speakership-Focus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump Dismisses Speaker of the House Buzz: ‘Eyes Set on the Presidency’" /><published>2023-10-05T12:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-05T12:25:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/05/Trump-Speakership-Focus</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/05/Trump-Speakership-Focus/">&lt;p&gt;Amidst the swirl of political rumors, former President Donald Trump makes his stance clear, sidelining the possibility of eyeing the Speaker of the House role, and reaffirming his commitment to once again securing the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a candid interaction at the New York State courthouse, Trump quashed speculation surrounding his potential candidacy for the House’s top spot. “While numerous people have approached me regarding the speakership role,” Trump stated, “My overarching focus remains on the presidency and reigniting our national motto, ‘Make America Great Again’. Our nation is facing setbacks, and that is where my attention is drawn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This public proclamation by Trump arises as the House of Representatives grapples with a significant shift in leadership dynamics. The recent ousting of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) by a decisive vote of 216-210 has left the coveted position up for grabs. Notably, the vote saw eight of McCarthy’s fellow Republicans joining the Democrat caucus in the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the position now vacant, some GOP frontrunners, such as Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), the majority whip, are all seen as contenders. While Trump acknowledges the potential and capabilities of these “great people” within the Republican Party, he remains committed to his presidential aspirations. “When it comes to the race for president, my current lead by 50 points reflects my focus and where I believe my efforts are best suited,” Trump emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent tumult in the House reached fever pitch when McCarthy’s apparent belief in receiving support from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was left unmet. Addressing this political maneuvering, McCarthy expressed during a press conference, “I perceive today’s outcome as a strategic decision by the Democrats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement prior to the vote, Pelosi underscored the established process, saying, “In this Congress, it is the onus of House Republicans to nominate and elect the Speaker on the Floor. At this juncture, I see no grounds to deviate from this longstanding tradition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political landscape continues its unpredictable trajectory, Trump’s renewed commitment to the presidential race undoubtedly sets the stage for what promises to be an intense political season ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Amidst the swirl of political rumors, former President Donald Trump makes his stance clear, sidelining the possibility of eyeing the Speaker of the House role, and reaffirming his commitment to once again securing the presidency.

Jenkins is implicated in the alleged shooting of a Cleveland County deputy and the inadvertent killing of a motorist due to a stray bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident transpired during what started as a regular traffic stop, but quickly escalated into a chase. This altercation took place near the 60-mile marker of Interstate 35. The injured deputy, after being shot, was promptly airlifted to a nearby medical facility where he has been reported to be in stable condition. However, the incident took a tragic turn when an uninvolved motorist was fatally hit by a stray bullet, believed to be from the suspect’s firearm as he was shooting at the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kameron Jenkins, currently the focal point of this intensive manhunt, has been described by the OSBI as a Black man standing at approximately 6-foot-4, weighing around 170–200 pounds. Distinctive features include his black dreadlocks and brown eyes. The last outfit he was seen wearing was a white shirt. The severity of the situation is underlined by warnings from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol, emphasizing that Jenkins is not only armed and dangerous but may also be carrying a semi-automatic weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local news outlet FOX 25 in Oklahoma City shed further light, mentioning that Jenkins might be in a white trailer towed by a black pickup truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving deeper into Jenkins’ past, his criminal record presents several red flags. In 2015, he faced a maiming charge which was eventually dismissed. By 2017, he pleaded guilty to assault and battery charges. Not stopping there, Jenkins also entered guilty pleas for DUI and marijuana-related charges in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies are urging citizens to exercise extreme caution. The prevailing advice for anyone who spots Jenkins or has information about his whereabouts is to promptly call 911. Engaging with Jenkins or attempting to approach him can be perilous due to his considered armed and potentially volatile status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event has sent shockwaves across Oklahoma, with residents anxiously hoping for a swift resolution and the prevention of further incidents. With the collective efforts of the OSBI and other enforcement agencies, the goal remains to bring Jenkins into custody and ensure the safety of the public.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A grave turn of events has gripped Oklahoma as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations (OSBI), supported by multiple law enforcement agencies, spearheads a manhunt for Kameron Jenkins, a 25-year-old suspect.

The move aims to prevent any significant civil disturbances similar to those witnessed on January 6, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, based on inputs from over a dozen current and former government officials specializing in terrorism, paints a picture of the ongoing domestic-security landscape. Furthermore, it evaluates the Biden administration’s approach to the issue they label as “domestic terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One anonymous FBI official highlighted the Bureau’s delicate task of ensuring safety without infringing upon Americans’ constitutional rights. The FBI’s concentrated focus on Trump supporters could inadvertently spark anti-government activities that the Bureau strives to mitigate. “It has to tread very carefully,” the official emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s vocal criticism of Trump supporters, coupled with his administration’s portrayal of them as threats to democracy, intensifies the ongoing debate. Such narratives could push certain groups to adopt more extreme measures, especially if they feel marginalized by the system. It’s a delicate balance, with heightened stakes on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsweek’s access to classified FBI and Department of Homeland Security data led them to question if “terrorism” is the most accurate term to describe these domestic issues. Equally, whether strategies developed in response to global extremist groups like al-Qaida are appropriate for addressing domestic concerns remains debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable revelation from the investigation was the FBI’s introduction of a new subcategory in 2022: “AGAAVE-Other.” This classification encompasses “domestic violent extremists” driven by anti-government or anti-authority motivations. It specifically covers those inclined to target individuals based on their perceived political affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not explicitly stated, insiders have confirmed that the “AGAAVE-Other” title relates to politically-motivated violence stemming from Trump supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the FBI has been clear in its stance. They stated that the AGAAVE threat umbrella covers a range of violent extremists, targeting both Republican and Democratic affiliations. This point reaffirms that the investigations are not solely focused on Trump supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, another senior intelligence official candidly shared with Newsweek that Trump’s supporters represent a significant domestic threat. The FBI’s primary role is to address this potential for violence, they asserted. But the broader question of whether Trump and his followers pose a threat to the nation’s fabric is a complex one.

Wendy Munson, 57, a second-grade teacher at the school, was arrested on charges of teaching while under the influence of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to a report on Monday morning, sheriff’s deputies found Munson visibly impaired during her teaching hours. Following this discovery, she was subjected to a sobriety test which she subsequently failed. Munson was then arrested at approximately 8:20 a.m. and charged with driving with a blood alcohol content exceeding .08 percent, drunk driving, and child abuse with potential for severe bodily injury, as outlined in a Sutter County Sheriff’s Department press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming incident came to light when a co-worker at the school contacted local law enforcement. The arresting officers stated that when they arrived at the scene, Munson was actively teaching her class. It was later revealed that her blood alcohol level was nearly double the legal limit, even two hours after the initial interaction with the deputies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baljinder Dhillon, Nuestro Elementary School District Superintendent, promptly addressed the matter by sending a letter to parents, assuring them of their children’s safety. He mentioned that Munson was taken into custody without any disturbances, ensuring that the students did not witness the unsettling arrest. The letter also highlighted the school’s proactive approach by stating, “Your 2nd graders will have a long-term substitute. Our students’ safety and well-being remain our highest priority.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaitlynn Conley, a concerned parent, expressed her disbelief in an interview with CBS News. “I thought it was crazy,” she stated. Adding her perspective on Munson’s actions, she said, “I think she should’ve called out of work. I know people have fun weekends, but that was definitely not okay as an educator.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these reports, the sheriff’s office confirmed the existence of footage capturing Munson driving to school in her inebriated state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendy Munson’s arraignment is set for 3 p.m. Wednesday. As of now, there is no confirmation regarding her legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;

Steve Scalise (R-LA) has declared his intent to run for the Speaker of the House. The House Majority Leader made the announcement on Wednesday, expressing that he seeks the nomination with “a strong sense of responsibility and purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalise, a prominent figure from Louisiana, enjoys considerable support and affection from his fellow lawmakers. His announcement places him as a leading contender for the esteemed position. Many in the political circles remember Scalise for his tragic injury in 2017 when he was shot during a practice for a Republican baseball team. His resilience post the injury, including an extended recovery period and ongoing health challenges, is often viewed as a testament to his commitment to public service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Congressman’s credentials are impressive, having served as the Republican Whip for nearly ten years. He was also the Chairman of the Republican Conservative Committee (RSC), recognized as the most extensive conservative group within the House. The current chair of the RSC, Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK), is speculated to join the race too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of Scalise’s bid are fascinating, especially considering the recent events within the House Republican Conference. Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA) recent ousting from the top House position has set the stage for new leadership. Despite Scalise and McCarthy showcasing a publicly amicable relationship, they weren’t particularly close allies. In crucial situations, McCarthy often leaned on Rep. Garrett Graves (R-LA) and Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry (R-NC) instead of top deputies like Scalise and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN). This distance from McCarthy might turn out to be a strategic advantage for Scalise in the upcoming Speaker race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Scalise’s health might be a point of consideration for some colleagues. The Congressman recently shared the distressing news of a cancer diagnosis. While this could raise concerns about his ability to shoulder the demanding role, many peers have lauded his decision to run for the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) has also expressed his intent to vie for the Speaker post, adding more intrigue to the unfolding political drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Philadelphia has joined the ranks of various U.S. cities witnessing a crime surge. The city recorded a disturbing increase in homicides, surpassing 500 in consecutive years. Additionally, Philadelphia Police Department data reveals an alarming 16% rise in overall crime year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, Wylie’s concerns are far from misplaced. “West Philadelphia, where we serve our delectable cheesesteaks, is not immune to this crime wave,” Wylie remarked. As someone reintroducing a beloved restaurant to its eager fans, she explained, “It’s unpredictable. We don’t truly know who might walk in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a clearer picture, a video circulated on Jim’s West Steaks &amp;amp; Hoagies’ Instagram showcased an armed security guard, toting an assault-style rifle, standing guard. Wylie confirmed these guards’ presence during operational hours, underlining their unwavering commitment to ensuring safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical data sheds light on the stakes at play. In 2015, armed robbers made away with $215 from the cash register and the pockets of unsuspecting patrons at Jim’s Steaks. Such unsettling memories bolstered the current ownership’s resolve to strengthen security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While certain crime categories like armed robberies have witnessed a decrease, they remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. September was particularly tumultuous. Swarms of thieves descended on various Philadelphia businesses, leading to widescale lootings. Such rampant theft compelled the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to momentarily shutter all 48 city-based retail outlets, prioritizing safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Nochum, the store manager of Patriot Pharmacy, which was looted in September, expressed his anguish, “Looters aren’t just stealing from businesses; they’re stealing from our communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this backdrop, Wylie remains steadfast. Her primary aim is not just to serve the city’s favorite cheesesteaks but to provide a safe dining experience. “Our priority is people’s safety,” she stated firmly. In her view, the best way to deter potential criminals is by showing that safety precautions are already in place. Her hope is for patrons to continue relishing their cheesesteaks, knowing they’re in a secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a robust response to the escalating crime rate, Jim’s West Steaks &amp;amp; Hoagies, a cherished Philly cheesesteak institution, has enlisted armed security personnel to shield its patrons and workforce. This measure underscores a broader trend in Philadelphia, where businesses increasingly prioritize security in the face of mounting threats. Victoria Wylie, the co-owner of the famed eatery, emphasized the importance of proactive safety measures. “We’re no longer waiting for tragedies to strike.

Luna’s Principled Stance: A Beacon of Hope in House Leadership?</title><link href="/politics/2023/10/04/Luna-Leadership-Stand/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rep. Luna’s Principled Stance: A Beacon of Hope in House Leadership?" /><published>2023-10-04T16:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-04T16:34:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/10/04/Luna-Leadership-Stand</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/10/04/Luna-Leadership-Stand/">&lt;p&gt;In times where true leadership and principles seem to be waning in Washington, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has emerged as a refreshing voice of clarity and conviction. Drawing a line in the sand, Luna has decisively declared her support for a House speaker only if they are unwavering in their commitment to bring President Joe Biden’s impeachment to the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the surprising exit of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the distinguished speaker’s position, Luna didn’t shy away. She succinctly laid out the path for integrity in leadership: “A speaker who stands up against Jack Smith’s questionable election interference probes, ensures accountability by subpoenaing Hunter Biden, and remains resolute in ushering an impeachment vote for Joe Biden.” Luna’s principled stance was shared with the nation on X, the successor to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a heartfelt emphasis on safeguarding transparent elections and eliminating governmental shadows, Luna rightfully pointed out, “The very essence of America depends on actions reflecting these values. My support is conditional on these uncompromising terms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, the House is in a precarious position. The absence of a speaker has left the legislative body in limbo, requiring the swift election of a dedicated leader to move forward. It’s noteworthy that Luna, in her continued pursuit of genuine representation, opted not to participate in the contentious vote which led to McCarthy’s ousting. McCarthy’s departure was marked by eight of his party members aligning with Democrats, resulting in a narrow 216-210 vote against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, although McCarthy had ignited the spark of an impeachment inquiry against Biden, he abstained from seeing it through to a vote, betraying the anticipation of many. Luna’s initial reluctance to back McCarthy earlier this year is now seen in a new light. After days of voting and uncertainty, McCarthy clinched the speaker position on the 15th ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with Luna’s commendable and straightforward stance, the nation watches keenly. Who among the House leadership will step up, aligning with Luna’s vision for a transparent and accountable America? As the winds of change blow through Washington, it’s evident that the discussion surrounding Biden’s potential impeachment could very well shape the House’s leadership narrative in the coming phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In times where true leadership and principles seem to be waning in Washington, Rep.

However, their relationship is once again in the limelight, not for a new track or tech innovation, but for a legal tussle involving the parental rights of their three uniquely-named children: X Æ A-Xii, Exa Dark Sideræl, and Techno Mechanicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grimes, known offstage as Claire Boucher, recently lodged a “petition to establish parental relationship” in a California court, as reported by the Daily Mail. Such petitions serve to legally identify a child’s parents, especially when the parents have never tied the knot. Beyond mere identification, these petitions can be a stepping stone to child custody and support order proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this move, the 35-year-old artist hasn’t publicly expressed desires regarding child support or custody rights. As for Musk, the visionary behind ventures such as Tesla and SpaceX, there hasn’t been any public acknowledgment or response to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grimes’ concerns run deeper than formalities. A now-removed post on the platform, X, conveys her anguish: “Tell Shivon to unblock me and tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer,” she said, alluding to Shivon Zilis. Zilis, an executive at Musk’s neurotech firm, Neuralink, bore Musk’s twins via IVF, though she maintains a strictly professional relationship with him. Grimes’ pain is palpable as she continues, “I have never even been allowed to see a photo of these children until this moment, despite the situation utterly ripping my family apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, whose family tree boasts 11 branches in the form of his children, seems to have complex dynamics when it comes to parenthood. Besides the trio with Grimes, he has 17-month-old twins, Azure and Strider, with Zilis, and six more children with his first wife, Justine Wilson. Tragically, one of them, Nevada, succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as an infant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Tesla CEO’s vocal concerns about potential population declines, his stance on having children seems clear. As he expressed on X, “Having children is saving the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this legal drama unfolds, fans and onlookers can only hope for a resolution that prioritizes the well-being of the children involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">In the world of entertainment and tech billionaires, few partnerships have garnered as much attention as that of singer Grimes and entrepreneur Elon Musk.

As the media spotlight zooms in on this harrowing case, the supposed offspring hopes that his father “dies in prison.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Sena’s disappearance made headlines when she vanished after a simple bike ride in Lake Moreau State Park. Fortunately, the child was later found, having been hidden in a cabinet within Ross’s unkempt camper, parked behind another property in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tumultuous case has captured the nation’s attention, as desperate searches led to an unexpected outcome. After the young girl’s ordeal, her family expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the various agencies, volunteers, and community members who rallied together to ensure Charlotte’s safe return. The Sena family is now channeling their efforts to help Charlotte recover, dedicating a GoFundMe campaign to support the 9-year-old’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Jr., now in custody on charges of first-degree kidnapping, had previously left a ransom note in the Sena family’s mailbox, leading to his arrest. The swift action of state police was pivotal in capturing Ross Jr., with their investigation further bolstered by evidence from a past DUI arrest in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As investigators don their Tyvek suits, poring over Ross Jr.’s Porter Corners residence and removing key evidence, the unexpected appearance of a man claiming to be the accused’s son added another layer to this unfolding drama. Frustrated and overwhelmed, he vented his dismay, stating, “Yeah, he’s my father, but why do I have to deal with this? Everyone is asking me all this. I don’t know anything. I hate him and hope he dies in prison.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case serves as a sobering reminder of the impact of crime not only on the victims but also on the families of those accused. The community’s support has been unwavering, with the New York State Police and the FBI receiving particular praise for their role in ensuring Charlotte’s safe return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case continues to unravel, the focus remains on supporting young Charlotte, highlighting the importance of community vigilance, and hoping for justice to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a startling turn of events surrounding the kidnapping case of Charlotte Sena, the man claiming to be the son of the prime suspect, Craig Ross Jr., broke his silence.
