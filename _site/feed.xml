A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Governor Greg Abbott Takes a Stand - Is NYC’s Migrant Crisis Really Texas’s Fault?</title><link href="/news/2023/09/08/Abbott-Defends-Texas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Governor Greg Abbott Takes a Stand - Is NYC’s Migrant Crisis Really Texas’s Fault?" /><published>2023-09-08T19:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-08T19:36:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/08/Abbott-Defends-Texas</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/08/Abbott-Defends-Texas/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Greg Abbott Stands Tall Against Unfair Accusations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Governor Greg Abbott faces unwarranted criticism from New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the Lone Star State’s “Operation Lone Star” initiative. Mayor Adams might be looking for a scapegoat, but the numbers and facts reveal a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending “Operation Lone Star”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star” is a proactive measure to ensure border security. A component of this mission is the busing of migrants to sanctuary cities, ensuring an equitable distribution and relief for overwhelmed border towns. Contrary to Mayor Adams’ portrayal, this initiative was designed with community welfare in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a September 6 town hall meeting, Mayor Adams seemed to pass the buck onto Texas, exclaiming, “It started with a madman down in Texas [who] decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.” However, his emotional remarks paint a misleading picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving Deep into the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Adams bemoans the impact on New York City, he conveniently omits the broader context. Governor Abbott was quick to point out that Texas had bused only 13,300 migrants to New York. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers brought in by federal initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbott’s press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, shed light on this selective narrative. “Mayor Adams was proud of his sanctuary city status until Texas began busing migrants to New York City,” Mahaleris highlighted, emphasizing the hypocrisy of such a stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Mahaleris urged Mayor Adams to consider the bigger picture, suggesting he address concerns to President Biden’s administration. The federal government, under Biden, has been “flying planeloads of migrants all around the country, straining state and local resources,” Mahaleris noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Finger-Pointing: The True Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mayor Adams seems occupied with shifting blame, Governor Abbott remains focused on the core issue at hand: the safety, security, and welfare of communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mayor Adams’s alarmist remarks cannot be ignored entirely. The influx from various parts of the world, the looming fiscal challenges, and the broader implications for the nation’s socio-economic fabric demand attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains evident is that the challenge is a national one and not a creation of any single state’s policies. While the debate between NYC and Texas heats up, one can hope that the focus will shift from blame games to constructive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Governor Greg Abbott Stands Tall Against Unfair Accusations Texas Governor Greg Abbott faces unwarranted criticism from New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the Lone Star State’s “Operation Lone Star” initiative.

During a candid interview with Newsmax’s “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Pence declared that the value of life is paramount, even more so than winning an election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a charged political environment where political calculations often override principles, Pence’s bold proclamation stands out. Challenging a common belief, Pence dismissed the notion, earlier suggested by former President Trump, that their administration lost midterm elections because of overturning Roe v. Wade. “I don’t believe that for a second,” Pence responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just politics, Pence views the right to life as a deep moral conviction. He expressed concerns about some wanting to reduce the life issue to a state-level matter. “For me, right to life’s not a state issue, it’s a moral issue. I’ll be a champion for right to life in the Oval Office,” he passionately conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence’s words weren’t solely about unborn children but extended to women in distressing situations as well. His remarks highlight the compassion underlying the pro-life stance: “I think when you stand on the right to life, you stand with principle and compassion and demonstrate not just a willingness to put our arms around the unborn but around newborns and women in crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels with international sentiment, Pence highlighted that most European nations have restrictions on abortion after the unborn child can feel pain. This aligns with the beliefs of a vast majority of Americans, with 70% sharing this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the GOP primary is unfolding with various stances and policies, Pence wants to be recognized for his unwavering conservative approach. He refrained from diving deep into the populist policies of Trump, only emphasizing that their administration had always governed with conservative principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pence’s interview underscores his dedication to the pro-life movement. As the political sphere evolves with various narratives, Pence’s commitment to life, compassion, and moral values remains unshaken.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Former Vice President Mike Pence has resoundingly affirmed his unwavering commitment to the pro-life cause, emphasizing that the right to life holds more weight than political gamesmanship.

&lt;p&gt;In a move that sets the city apart from the rest of the state, the City of Huntington Beach, California, made a crucial decision on Wednesday: it will not impose universal mask and vaccine mandates for COVID-19. This move highlights the ever-growing divide between the freedom-centric localities and the broader state measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Victory for Personal Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motion to ban the mandates, brought forward by Mayor Pro Tem Gracey Van Der Mark, emphasizes the importance of individual liberties. Van Der Mark critiqued past mask mandates, declaring that they “unnecessarily limited the freedoms of the citizens of Huntington Beach.” In a society where autonomy should be celebrated, these measures were seen as restrictive, especially for individuals who had no exposure or risk associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the decision was not taken lightly. With a narrow 4-3 vote, the City Council showcased the weight of the debate, highlighting that while there is support for personal freedom, there are voices of caution as well. However, the motion’s successful passing signifies that, at least in Huntington Beach, the voice of liberty rings louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Response to a Slight Rise in Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the decision comes amidst a slight increase in COVID cases within the city, it stands as a testament to the city’s commitment to maintaining the rights of its citizens. The current uptick does not appear to have deterred the local government’s determination to prioritize choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntington Beach - A History of Defiance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huntington Beach’s move isn’t surprising for those familiar with its history. Located a mere hour from Los Angeles, the city has been a beacon of resistance against statewide mask mandates throughout the pandemic’s duration. In stark contrast to California’s rigid approach, Huntington Beach opts for personal choice and autonomy, reflecting its longstanding conservative roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Larger Trend or a Lone Rebellion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether other cities will follow Huntington Beach’s footsteps remains to be seen. However, the city’s latest decision cements its reputation as a bastion for conservatives and those valuing personal freedoms over sweeping state directives. As the debate surrounding COVID measures continues to polarize the nation, Huntington Beach stands as a reminder that there’s more than one way to address the challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Defying Statewide Draconian Measures, Huntington Beach Makes A Stand In a move that sets the city apart from the rest of the state, the City of Huntington Beach, California, made a crucial decision on Wednesday: it will not impose universal mask and vaccine mandates for COVID-19.

&lt;p&gt;While the world was preoccupied with the spectacle of former President Donald Trump’s voluntary surrender at Fulton County Jail, a grave and haunting pattern of inmate deaths emerged in the shadows of the facility. Six fatalities have been reported since the end of July, intensifying concerns over the jail’s operations and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presidential Surrender Overshadows a Dire Situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jail gained immense attention when Trump turned himself in due to charges stemming from alleged election interference in Georgia. The media fervently covered his booking and that of his 18 co-defendants. However, beneath this high-profile event, the stark reality of life in the jail came into focus with the tragic death of 24-year-old Shawndre Delmore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disturbing incidents, such as the death of 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson caused by apparent severe neglect, have painted a bleak picture of the facility’s conditions. This alarming environment prompted the Department of Justice (DOJ) to launch a civil investigation, addressing growing concerns over violence, deplorable living conditions, and even reports of an inmate’s body found with insect infestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Series of Troubling Deaths within Jail Walls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Delmore, several inmates have met untimely deaths within the prison’s confines in recent weeks. Samuel Lawrence, Dayvion Blake, Alexander Hawkins, Christopher Smith, and Montay Stinson all faced tragic ends, with Blake’s fatal stabbing further emphasizing the urgent need for reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: The Need for Transparency and Reform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a series of tragedies unfolding at Fulton County Jail, it’s paramount that the facility undergoes scrutiny and reforms to prevent further loss of life.

&lt;p&gt;As fans of the show may recall, the Duggar family’s journey to stardom was punctuated with not just the highs of a growing family but also the challenging lows of scandals and internal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jill, 32, and Derick, 34, one of the major hindrances to their marital peace was the extreme expectations surrounding obedience and submission to Jim Bob’s desires. In a heartfelt interview, Jill disclosed, “It definitely got between us… No matter your age, you are to obey your parents’ wishes, and you even have to ask them for their blessing for any major moment in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derick further recounted instances where Jim Bob allegedly attempted to “weaponize” their relationship, using it as leverage when the couple resisted his plans for the show. He lamented, “He would weaponize the relationship and say, ‘Is this you Jill, or is this you, Derick? Are you leading your wife astray and doing things that are not supportive of marriage?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just emotional manipulation that the couple faced; financial matters were also a bone of contention. Jill shed light on the fact that she was paid a mere $175,000 for a decade’s worth of filming, even though the show reportedly raked in over $8 million. The catch? The checks from TLC were directly handed over to Jim Bob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, in a statement, expressed their love for all their children and emphasized their commitment to resolving conflicts honorably. However, they refrained from addressing the claims made by Jill and Derick directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this isn’t the first time the Duggar family name has been steeped in controversy. The show itself was axed from TLC following a molestation scandal linked to Jill’s brother, Josh Duggar, in 2015. Matters further escalated when Josh was sentenced to over a dozen years in prison in December 2022 for child pornography charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the future remains uncertain for the Duggars, one thing is clear: the allure of reality TV stardom often comes at a price.

&lt;p&gt;In a narrow contest, Trump just nudges past Biden, gathering 47% to Biden’s 46%. While Trump’s lead is within the poll’s margin of error, it underscores the political duress Biden could face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Trump is not alone in this advantage. Notably, Nikki Haley surpasses Biden with a 49% to 43% lead, clearly sidestepping the poll’s margin of error. Both Pence and Scott find themselves two points ahead, holding 46% to Biden’s 44%. Chris Christie also pushes past Biden by two points, clocking in at 44% versus Biden’s 42%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis draws even with Biden, each amassing 47% of the hypothetical vote. Only anti-woke entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy seems to be on the back foot, trailing Biden by a single point — 46% to 45%. However, given the poll’s margin of error, even this matchup can be considered a virtual tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers spell potential trouble for Biden. As the 2024 elections approach, concerns regarding his age and overall capabilities are becoming more pronounced, even among Democratic ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, Trump’s messaging remains confrontational and assertive. The former president, as active as ever on his platform, Truth Social, recently issued stark warnings, promising to address issues from his past term. Trump’s rhetoric focuses on seeking justice for perceived wrongs during his tenure, ranging from impeachment attempts to election controversies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the political scene unravels and contenders firm up their strategies, this latest CNN poll hints at an intense race ahead. Whether Biden can regain momentum remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the GOP field is geared up and raring to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">CNN’s recent poll has the political scene buzzing, and the numbers don’t bode well for President Joe Biden.

John James of Michigan, proposes a groundbreaking resolution. Aimed at establishing an upper age limit for holding federal elected offices, the proposal calls for constitutional amendment considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, there are age criteria to meet to run for president, vice president, or Congress. However, these are minimum age requirements. Rep. James’s resolution addresses the other end of the spectrum, stipulating that no one could run for these roles if they would turn 75 or older during their term. The rationale? Adapting to an ever-changing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The world’s not getting slower, it’s getting faster. The world’s not getting safer, it’s getting more dangerous,” James shared with Fox News Digital. “We have a lower bound; it just makes sense to have an upper bound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal comes amid rising concerns regarding the age and health of some prominent politicians. Top names like Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and even President Biden have faced public scrutiny regarding their fitness to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James took a direct stance, expressing concerns not just for internal governance but also for how the nation is perceived externally. “You can’t watch a video of Feinstein or McConnell or Biden and tell me that everything’s OK,” he commented. “America has lost a step.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many might view this as a controversial move, James points out that the Founding Fathers never envisioned lifetime tenures in the legislature. His perspective echoes a need for periodic refreshment and rejuvenation of the political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that implementing such a significant change won’t be easy or swift. Constitutional amendments require broad consensus, needing two-thirds approval from both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James’s resolution forms part of a broader government accountability package he’s championing. Other propositions include service time caps in Congress and withholding congressional pay during government shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the future of these resolutions remains uncertain, they surely underscore a fresh wave of thought, emphasizing adaptability, accountability, and the nation’s future preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The winds of change are blowing on Capitol Hill as freshman House Republican, Rep.

&lt;p&gt;In a move many see as an affront to the Second Amendment, the California Senate audaciously approved an 11% tax on guns and ammunition. This legislation, which now returns to the state assembly for another vote, may soon find its way to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for final approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Masked Deterrent to Gun Ownership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposed by Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, this tax appears to be more than a mere revenue-generating endeavor. On the surface, it is touted as a mechanism to enhance “school safety.” However, the specifics on how this tax directly ensures such safety remain conspicuously ambiguous. The underlying message seems clear: make gun ownership more expensive, thus discouraging citizens from exercising their constitutionally protected right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns Overreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While California prides itself on being progressive, there’s a thin line between progression and overreach. The state’s already rigid gun laws restrict K-12 educators from bearing arms for the protection of their students. Additionally, concealed carry permit holders face prohibitions against arming themselves on college campuses. With this tax, is California subtly trying to price out the average citizen’s access to their Second Amendment rights?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California Rifle and Pistol Association President, Chuck Michel, emphatically voiced his concerns, dubbing the move a “poll tax” and likening it to taxing a fundamental constitutional right. Highlighting the gravity of the issue, Michel declared, “We’re going to have to file a lawsuit to challenge it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Future Under Threat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the legislation makes its final journey through the state assembly, it serves as a stark reminder of the continuous challenges faced by the Second Amendment. This isn’t merely a debate about a tax; it’s a dialogue about the sanctity of our constitutional rights. If a foundational right can be taxed, what does that spell for the future of our freedoms?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">California’s Unsettling Move: Taxing the Right to Bear Arms In a move many see as an affront to the Second Amendment, the California Senate audaciously approved an 11% tax on guns and ammunition.

&lt;p&gt;Court sketches depicted an emotional scene as actor and model Bijou Phillips, Masterson’s wife, looked on. Masterson was seen blowing a kiss to her just moments before being escorted away. The verdict came after an eight-day deliberation, where a jury found him guilty of two counts of forcible rape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maximum-punishment-meted-out&quot;&gt;Maximum Punishment Meted Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo handed down the 15 years-to-life imprisonment for each count to be served consecutively. This verdict ensures that Masterson will only be eligible for parole after 25 1/2 years, keeping the possibility open for a lifetime sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Attorney George Gascón lauded the verdict, citing the challenging journey faced by the victims. In his words, the case against Masterson highlights the often-uneven playing field victims face when challenging influential figures. He hopes the verdict brings solace to the victims and serves as a deterrent to others who might exploit their position of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-glimmer-of-hope-for-masterson&quot;&gt;A Glimmer of Hope for Masterson?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severe sentencing, Masterson’s legal team remains optimistic. They’ve voiced concerns about what they perceive as “substantial” errors during the trial and intend to appeal the court’s decision. Shawn Holley, Masterson’s attorney, stressed their respect for the justice system but emphasized that they believe an incorrect verdict was reached in this case. They are confident in their hopes to overturn the convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scientology-in-the-spotlight&quot;&gt;Scientology in the Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial has not only shone a spotlight on Masterson but also on the Church of Scientology. Accusations flew regarding the Church’s role in the aftermath of the alleged assaults. Victims claimed reluctance in filing charges, pointing fingers at the Church’s strict internal handling of such issues. The Church, however, refuted these claims, stating their clear policy on adhering to the laws of the land and dispelling rumors of harassment of the accusers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-emotional-turmoil&quot;&gt;An Emotional Turmoil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As statements flowed in from various parties, the impact on the victims became evident. Impact statements delivered in court painted a picture of the trauma and emotional scarring these events have left behind. One of the victims stated, “When you raped me, you stole from me,” describing rape as a “theft of the spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masterson, once a beloved figure on ‘That ’70s Show’, now faces the reality of his actions. As the entertainment industry reflects on another one of its own falling from grace, the broader conversation around power dynamics, consent, and the role of institutions in such cases continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
