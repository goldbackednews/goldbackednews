A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Faith at the Forefront: Det. Fil Waters’ Journey to Truth</title><link href="/news/2023/10/07/Faith-and-Justice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Faith at the Forefront: Det.

With a remarkable 96% clearance rate and a 90% confession rate, he humbly credits a higher power - God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After giving up a lucrative career in construction management, Waters felt a powerful “calling” to law enforcement. Over his 24-year tenure at HPD, he worked diligently on 400 homicide cases, clearing an overwhelming majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My faith grew stronger… and I was getting more in tune with God’s plan for me,” Waters shared in a recent interview. Throughout his service, Waters felt that his connection with the divine played a pivotal role. From undercover narcotics operations, where he had to assume different identities, to the nuanced interview processes of his homicide days, he believed God was guiding him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Waters, his communication skills were integral. Not just the verbal exchange, but the capacity to empathize, listen, and build trust. He emphasized the necessity of patience and open-mindedness in interviews, especially when confronted with suspects accused of heinous crimes. To him, it was always about uncovering the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to be patient. And empathetic,” Waters stressed. “It’s always a journey for the truth.” He often entered interrogation rooms, conscious of a divine presence, praying for transparency and the ability to reflect Christ’s love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such challenging case was a 2015 triple homicide at a Houston car dealership. The investigation, later featured in Investigation Discovery’s “The Interrogator,” revolved around James Tinsley. Tinsley was convicted in 2017 for the brutal killing of three family members over car payments. Waters recounts this particular interrogation with Tinsley as intense, but he managed to extract valuable information even without a formal confession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a seasoned detective, Waters emphasizes the importance of listening more and speaking less. He encourages budding law enforcement officers to be open-minded and attentive, treating everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waters’ legacy in HPD and his unwavering faith serve as a testament that in the search for truth, sometimes, the guiding light comes from above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Detective Fil Waters, once a significant figure in the Houston Police Department’s (HPD) homicide unit, is not just another detective; he is a man of deep faith and conviction.

Produced by Grace Productions, this film delves deep into the compelling journey of three churches that resisted government lockdowns during the pandemic’s peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronicling the endeavors of Grace Community Church in Los Angeles, Fairview Baptist Church in Calgary, Canada, and GraceLife Church, also in Canada, the film captures the raw emotions, decisions, and spiritual dilemmas faced by the Christian community. These churches, led by their dedicated pastors, believed in their divine duty to remain open, even as governments issued directives to shut down public gatherings, including religious assemblies, to curb the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely capturing events, “The Essential Church” raises potent questions: How real was the threat of the COVID-19 virus? What right does the government have to close places of worship? Should Christians prioritize obeying civil authorities or their spiritual convictions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw sweeping predictions about its transmission rate and lethal potential. Many health experts declared it a significant health crisis. Guided by such alarming forecasts, governments worldwide took drastic steps, including shutting down religious gatherings. These actions sparked debates about the violation of freedom of religion, especially when predictions about the virus turned out to be inflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the documentary explores, was it right for these churches to oppose these shutdowns when the world was still grappling with understanding the virus? Was the government’s approach—employing police force to ensure compliance—an overreach, impinging upon religious freedoms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As “The Essential Church” ascends to the top of Apple’s iTunes Store charts, its success signals the resonance of its themes with audiences. The film offers not just an insightful look into the churches’ battles but also acts as a mirror, prompting viewers to reflect on the balance between civil duties and spiritual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

The controversy highlights the complex web of personal challenges and public scrutiny surrounding the president’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the Daily Mail, Hunter, facing a nearly depleted bank account, withdrew a substantial sum of $20,000 from Maisy’s college fund. This decision followed an email alert from Wells Fargo on December 17, 2018, revealing a mere 44 cents balance in his account. A hasty instruction to the bank ensued, directing them to transfer the said amount from his daughter’s savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s expenditures during this period raise eyebrows. With admissions of a “full-blown addiction” to crack cocaine and spending on prostitutes, emails suggest the diverted money funded not just these vices but also high-end commodities like sports cars and online adult subscriptions. Such revelations, sourced from Hunter’s much-discussed laptop, continue to taint his image and, by extension, cast shadows on the Biden family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, emails from Hunter’s assistant, Katie Dodge, underscored his financial distress. Amid reminders of pending bills and expenditures, Hunter’s response painted a bleak picture: reduced payments to staff, deferred expenses, and references to his business partner’s incarceration in China – a nod to businessman Ye Jianming’s mysterious public disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s financial challenges don’t stand alone. He appeared in federal court, accused of making false statements related to firearm purchases and possessing a firearm as an unlawful drug user or addict. Pleading not guilty to these allegations, Hunter faces potential penalties ranging up to 25 years in prison, with each count also carrying a potential fine of $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of financial distress, alleged misuse of family funds, and legal challenges adds another chapter to Hunter Biden’s tumultuous public narrative. As he navigates these controversies, the Biden family also faces the challenge of maintaining their public standing amid these personal and potentially damaging revelations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the president’s son remains a topic of both media and public interest, it’s essential to discern factual reports from politically motivated narratives. As details emerge and legal proceedings progress, the true depth of these allegations and their potential implications for the Biden administration will become clearer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Recent revelations claim that Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, diverted funds from his daughter Maisy’s college savings during a period of financial turmoil.

Maher attributed this decline to the stark visual of homelessness and the rise in theft cases, such as the need for store items like hair scrunchies to be locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It just doesn’t feel good when you see tents everywhere on the street,” remarked Maher, highlighting the increasing visibility of homelessness as a factor in the public’s perception of the nation’s wellbeing. The sentiment was strong: witnessing homelessness at such a scale gives a sense that “the country’s [not] right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthering his argument on the atmosphere of insecurity, Maher commented on the stringent security measures some stores have been forced to adopt due to theft. He voiced his own displeasure, “It just doesn’t feel good when I’ve got to get a sales associate to unlock the hair scrunchies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk show host’s comments reflect a broader debate surrounding law enforcement, crime rates, and societal compassion. Maher raised the question of balance, pondering the difficulty in finding a “middle ground” between liberal cities downplaying certain crimes and the aggressive approach of figures like former President Donald Trump, who once mentioned “shooting shoplifters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Isgur, ABC News Contributor and The Dispatch Editor, joined the discussion, criticizing what she termed as “luxury beliefs” held by those untouched by the direct consequences of crime. According to Isgur, such views masquerade as compassion but may indirectly promote harmful practices, such as drug cartels profiting from human smuggling or being nonchalant about rampant drug use on streets. “It’s not compassionate to tell someone that they should die on the sidewalk,” she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher concurred, drawing attention to the psychological toll such issues can have on individuals. He reiterated that these real-world situations and their direct impact on the lives of Americans might be the underlying reason for the disapproval sentiments against Biden. In his words, “Biden’s always saying, why don’t people like me more? And then they cite numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;

Recent polling data reveals Trump’s lead over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has surged by a staggering 20 points nationally in just over two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dramatic shift was highlighted by a recent poll published on Wednesday, showcasing Trump’s support among registered Republicans and independents who lean Republican at 56%. This marks a 10-point increase from July’s Marquette poll, which pegged him at 46%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, DeSantis experienced a drop in support, losing ten points since July. The Florida Governor now garners only 12% of the support, indicating a significant shift in the political landscape within the Republican camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times further highlighted DeSantis’s challenges, noting the campaign’s decision to relocate a third of its staff to Iowa and its current financial status. DeSantis’s campaign war chest for GOP primary purposes stands at a concerning $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican field remains diverse, with Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, not far behind DeSantis at six percent. Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, and former Vice President Mike Pence share fourth place, each holding four percent of the support. Interestingly, Ramaswamy witnessed a three-point increase from July, while Pence saw a three percent decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this political poll mix, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) also made appearances, holding two percent and one percent support, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

The incursion marked a significant escalation in the conflict between the two territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, rockets flew from the Gaza Strip, hitting regions of southern Israel. The assault, which Hamas has proudly taken responsibility for, has led to over 100 Israelis losing their lives. The conflict’s gravity deepened as Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, dubbed the attack “the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.” He called on Palestinians everywhere to confront Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retaliation, Israeli air strikes took the lives of 198 Palestinians, Gaza health officials confirmed. The wave of attacks has overwhelmed hospitals, which are currently treating nearly 985 injured individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message, explicitly stated, “Citizens of Israel, we are at war.” Ambulance crews raced to regions around the Gaza Strip, while sirens warned residents across Israel. Hospital reports indicate hundreds of wounded, including civilians, signaling the broad reach of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gunmen have targeted civilians in Israeli towns, with video footage capturing confrontations in city streets. The Israeli military commented, “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” urging residents near the Gaza border to stay indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson firmly condemned the unprovoked attacks. She stressed, “There is never any justification for terrorism,” reaffirming America’s allegiance to Israel. European leaders, too, stood in solidarity with Israel, denouncing Hamas’s actions. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union’s executive commission, labeled the attack as “terrorism in its most despicable form,” asserting Israel’s right to self-defense. Prominent European heads of state echoed this sentiment, highlighting their strong support for Israel during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While confrontations between Israel and Gaza are not unprecedented, the recent surge in aggression is unparalleled. With the Israeli defense establishment making strategic evaluations and preparations, the conflict, which started with Hamas’s surprise attacks on Saturday, is anticipated to extend for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world watches closely, hoping for a swift resolution to prevent further loss of life and restore peace in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a striking display of aggression not witnessed before, Hamas, the militant Islamist group, has claimed responsibility for a brutal attack on Israel that has resulted in over 100 Israeli casualties. The incursion marked a significant escalation in the conflict between the two territories. On Saturday, rockets flew from the Gaza Strip, hitting regions of southern Israel. The assault, which Hamas has proudly taken responsibility for, has led to over 100 Israelis losing their lives. The conflict’s gravity deepened as Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, dubbed the attack “the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.” He called on Palestinians everywhere to confront Israelis. In retaliation, Israeli air strikes took the lives of 198 Palestinians, Gaza health officials confirmed. The wave of attacks has overwhelmed hospitals, which are currently treating nearly 985 injured individuals. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message, explicitly stated, “Citizens of Israel, we are at war.” Ambulance crews raced to regions around the Gaza Strip, while sirens warned residents across Israel. Hospital reports indicate hundreds of wounded, including civilians, signaling the broad reach of the conflict. Gunmen have targeted civilians in Israeli towns, with video footage capturing confrontations in city streets. The Israeli military commented, “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” urging residents near the Gaza border to stay indoors.

The crux? Trump’s most prized assets, including the iconic Trump Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to delay the trial, Trump’s legal team is challenging a court ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron, which could spell the dissolution of companies controlling some of Trump’s major assets. The gravity of this ruling suggests a court-appointed receiver might oversee Trump’s businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing attention, Trump lawyers Clifford Robert, Michael Farina, and Michael Madaio penned a 41-page appellate brief, describing the potential havoc Engoron’s verdict could bring. They emphasized the “severe and irreparable harm” not just to Trump and the defendants but also to countless employees relying on those businesses for their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backdrop is set with the appellate court already dismissing a previous attempt to delay the trial, mere days before its commencement. Adding to the evolving scenario, Trump’s legal representatives withdrew a lawsuit against Judge Engoron last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, remains steadfast. James’ office conveyed their openness to discuss enforcing Engoron’s verdict post-trial. However, they desire the trial to persist without interruptions. Senior Assistant Solicitor General Dennis Fan argued against abruptly halting the trial, citing the logistical intricacies, security arrangements, and potential inconvenience to scheduled witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revealing an intriguing turn of events, Engoron concluded last week that Trump engaged in fraudulent activities while establishing his real estate empire. This verdict stems from James’ lawsuit that accused Trump of deceiving various stakeholders by inflating the value of his assets in annual financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, however, rebuts these allegations, contending that many of his assets are undervalued in those statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring clarity, Engoron delineated the procedures for enforcing his ruling last Thursday. He allocated deadlines for both parties to suggest potential receivers and directed Trump and the defendants to inform a court-appointed monitor about the entities affected by his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant directive also mandated the defendants to notify the monitor before applying for new business licenses or trying to form new entities that might inherit the assets of a dissolving company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s attorneys, though, counter-argue that Engoron’s decision lacks a coherent legal basis, dubbing it as “the corporate death penalty.” They further criticize the judge for ambiguity in elucidating the real-world implications of his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier pretrial hearing, another Trump lawyer, Christopher Kise, sought clarity from Engoron on the extent of the ruling’s impact on Trump’s assets. Engoron, however, deferred his response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing their appeal, Trump’s legal team underscores their concerns about the far-reaching consequences of Engoron’s “overbroad directive,” emphasizing its potential to usher in “confusion and chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;

The power couple now faces a federal indictment linked to a bribery scheme spanning multiple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hefty allegations trace back to a seemingly opulent lifestyle: a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible, bars of gold, and an influx of hard cash. With these revelations, it’s no wonder that Sen. Menendez recently resigned from his esteemed position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This isn’t his first rendezvous with the law either. Back in 2016, he was indicted on similar bribery charges, a case that eventually resulted in his acquittal in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story unfolds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2018, Arslanian starts her romantic journey with Menendez. It’s during this time that Menendez becomes acquainted with businessman Wael Hana. Hana’s close ties with Egyptian officials, coupled with connections to New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes and insurance expert Jose Uribe, become central to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2018 to 2022, Menendez and Arslanian allegedly receive a myriad of bribes from their new circle: gold bars, substantial cash amounts, a luxury Mercedes-Benz, mortgage payments, and home furnishings. The indictment even claims Menendez leaked sensitive U.S. government intel to Egyptian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, Daibes faces federal charges. However, two months later, Arslanian finds herself in the limelight after fatally hitting a pedestrian. Curiously, she was quickly released without a DUI test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2019, Uribe extends an offer to purchase a new Mercedes-Benz for the couple following Arslanian’s tragic accident. Menendez, in return, allegedly seeks to influence an investigation involving Uribe. Hana’s business then steps in, settling Arslanian’s house mortgage. Menendez is also said to have leveraged his influence to protect Hana’s business interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2020 to 2022, Menendez allegedly agrees to manipulate the prosecution of Daibes in a quid pro quo involving cash, gold, and furniture. By June 2022, an FBI raid at the Menendez residence unveils over half a million dollars in cash and multiple gold bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, charges are officially brought against both Arslanian and Menendez. Despite the growing clamor for his resignation, Menendez remains steadfast, pleading not guilty to all accusations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Menendez’s career now hangs in the balance, with the weight of years-long alleged corruption casting a long shadow.

The incident, confirmed by the Pentagon, occurred near Hasakah and was a direct response to the drone being perceived as a “potential threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin communicated with his Turkish counterpart, Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, emphasizing both nations’ joint commitment to defeating ISIS and ensuring regional stability. Despite the collapse of the ISIS “caliphate” in Raqqa in 2017, the US continues its military presence in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent actions, Turkey commenced aerial bombings in both Syria and Iraq on October 1. This move came in retaliation to an attempted suicide bombing in Ankara, claimed by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a US-designated terrorist group. The Turkish administration, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has asserted that these airstrikes aimed to dismantle PKK bases and resources. However, Turkey broadly categorizes several Kurdish factions in Syria and Iraq, some of which are US allies, under the same PKK label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This backdrop brings into context the Turkish drone’s proximity to the American outpost. Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder highlighted the immediate threat the drone posed, leading to the necessary defense action by US F-16 fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US views this as a regrettable but necessary measure, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency did not discuss the drone’s downing. However, the Turkish media did acknowledge their defense operations’ success in Syria, emphasizing the destruction of multiple PKK targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s growing concern on the ground. Reports from Kurdish news sources indicate that recent Turkish bombings in Syrian Kurdistan led to civilian casualties. Farhad Shami, head of the SDF media center, condemned Turkey’s targeting of infrastructure and public service facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident underscores the volatile dynamics in Syria, involving a matrix of actors with overlapping alliances and conflicting objectives. With US forces primarily in Syria to combat the ISIS threat, situations like these drone incidents emphasize the necessity for clear communication and cooperation between regional players to avoid unnecessary escalations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a developing situation that highlights the complexities of the Syrian arena, US Armed Forces shot down a Turkish drone close to an American base in northeast Syria.
