A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/11/02/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-11-02T08:30:25-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-02T08:30:25-04:00</updated><id>/2023/11/02/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/11/02/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Trump Fights for His Rightful Place on the 2024 Ballot</title><link href="/politics/2023/11/02/Trump-2024-Ballot-Case/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trump Fights for His Rightful Place on the 2024 Ballot" /><published>2023-11-02T08:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-11-02T08:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/11/02/Trump-2024-Ballot-Case</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/11/02/Trump-2024-Ballot-Case/">&lt;p&gt;In a courtroom in Colorado, the battle for justice and fairness rages on as former President Donald Trump takes a stand against attempts to unjustly remove him from the 2024 presidential ballot. A local state judge, Sarah B. Wallace, has denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, but the fight is far from over. The Trump legal team remains unshaken, ready to present a robust defense of the 45th President’s right to run for office again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six Colorado voters, four of whom identify as Republicans, have brought this case forward, attempting to disqualify Trump based on his alleged involvement in the January 6th events at the U.S. Capitol. They accuse the former president of inciting an insurrection, referencing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in their argument. However, the facts tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s attorneys have ardently argued that his speech on that fateful day was fully protected under the First Amendment, emphasizing his call for peaceful protest. Former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler, representing Trump, stated, “The failure to do something is the opposite of the word ‘engaged.’ President Trump didn’t engage…He gave a speech in which he asked people to peacefully and patriotically go to the Capitol and protest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal battle in Colorado is not an isolated incident. Similar cases are emerging in Minnesota and Michigan, as the left continues its relentless pursuit to silence Trump and his millions of supporters. But the Trump camp remains resilient, standing strong against these unfounded attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Trump supporters and conservative Republicans, this case represents yet another attempt by the left to undermine the democratic process and stifle the voice of the American people. Trump’s commitment to fighting this legal battle demonstrates his unwavering dedication to preserving the values that make America great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the hearings continue, all eyes are on Colorado, where the outcome of this case will set a precedent for future battles. The conservative community stands united, confident in Trump’s ability to overcome this challenge and continue his fight for a better, stronger America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a legacy of economic prosperity, national security, and unwavering patriotism, Trump’s place on the 2024 ballot is not just a legal matter—it’s a question of upholding the principles that define our nation. The people have spoken before, and they are ready to do so again, standing by a leader who has proven time and again that he puts America first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of adversity, Trump and his supporters remain optimistic, fueled by a deep love for their country and a steadfast belief in the power of the people.

Prosecutors had initially sought a staggering 100-year sentence, highlighting the gravity of the allegations against Nelson-Koch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson-Koch, who was 67 at the time of the crimes, engaged in illicit sexual activities with a 14-year-old boy in the school’s basement, subjecting him to repeated acts of sexual assault. The former teacher faced a plethora of charges, including sexual assault of a child, child enticement with sexual contact, and exposing intimate parts to a minor, resulting in her being found guilty on over a dozen counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prosecution presented a compelling case, detailing the severe trauma inflicted upon the young victim, the defense managed to shed light on Nelson-Koch’s character through testimonies from her friends. These character references played a pivotal role in the court’s decision, ultimately leading to a reduced sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this case extend far beyond the courtroom, as it has ignited a broader conversation about the safety of children in educational institutions and the need for stringent measures to prevent such horrific incidents. The Monroe County community has been left reeling, as parents grapple with the reality of sexual predators lurking within trusted institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the victim’s father delivered an emotional statement, imploring the court to protect his son and expressing his anguish over feeling helpless during the ordeal. The father’s words left an indelible mark on those present, underscoring the lasting impact of such heinous acts on victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistant District Attorney Sarah Skiles, representing Monroe County, expressed her commitment to safeguarding children and ensuring that perpetrators of sexual assault face the consequences of their actions. She highlighted the tireless efforts of Investigator Paul Sloan, who played a crucial role in bringing Nelson-Koch to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles on this harrowing case, the community is left to ponder the necessary steps to prevent such incidents in the future. The 10-year sentence handed down to Nelson-Koch serves as a stark reminder that even in our most trusted institutions, vigilance is paramount to protect the most vulnerable among us.&lt;/p&gt;

This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the surging violence plaguing our nation’s capital, highlighting the dire need for immediate action to protect law-abiding citizens and hold criminals accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attempted carjacking occurred around 10 p.m. Saturday in the 600 block of D Street, NW. A 12-year-old, together with 13-year-old Vernard Toney, Jr., menacingly approached an off-duty federal security officer, demanding he exit his vehicle while intimating possession of a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with what appeared to be a life-threatening situation, the officer, acting in self-defense, discharged his weapon, fatally wounding Toney. The 12-year-old accomplice fled the scene, leaving behind a scenario that is becoming all too common in D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police were able to track down and arrest the 12-year-old thanks to surveillance footage, and he now awaits his day in court. But this incident is just the tip of the iceberg in a city that has seen a disturbing increase in violent crime, particularly among minors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics are pointing fingers at the city’s lenient crime policies, which have created an environment where lawlessness prevails and criminals operate with impunity. The soft-on-crime approach, championed by liberal politicians and activists, has utterly failed the citizens of Washington D.C., leaving them to bear the brunt of escalating violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragic death of a young boy and the criminal involvement of another are clear indicators that the current system is not working. It is a call to action for leaders at all levels of government to step up, reject failed policies, and implement stringent measures to curb crime and ensure public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Governor Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency, mobilizing state resources and shining a light on the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse, which occurred late Tuesday, has sent shockwaves throughout the community and the state at large. Governor Beshear, taking to social media, urged the people of Kentucky to unite in prayer and support for the victims, their families, and the brave first responders working tirelessly at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One worker has lost their life, and another remains trapped. We are doing everything we can, and I urge you all to keep them in your thoughts and prayers,” Governor Beshear stated solemnly. This tragedy hits close to home for many in Kentucky, a state with deep roots in the coal industry, and it serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers faced by those working in this critical sector of our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Martin County Sheriff’s Office and multiple other agencies are on-site, navigating the challenging and dangerous conditions in a race against time to rescue the trapped worker. “This is a complex and delicate operation. We are pouring all of our resources into the rescue efforts, but we need the community’s support and prayers more than ever,” shared Martin County Sheriff John Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coal preparation plant, which had been out of commission for several years, was in the process of being dismantled when the unthinkable happened. “These workers were doing their job, preparing the structure for demolition when the building collapsed. It’s a tragic accident, and our hearts go out to all those affected,” explained Sheriff Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Beshear’s swift response, declaring a state of emergency, ensures that all necessary resources are made available to aid in the rescue efforts. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron also took to social media, calling for prayers and support for the trapped workers and the first responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy in Martin County serves as a somber reminder of the risks associated with the coal industry, and it highlights the need for continued attention to worker safety and structural integrity. As Kentucky grapples with this disaster, the unity and strength of its people will be paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Beshear’s message is clear: “In these trying times, we must come together as a community, as a state, and support one another. We are Kentucky strong, and we will get through this together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rescue operations continue, the eyes of the nation are on Kentucky, hoping and praying for a miracle amidst the devastation. The people of Kentucky, resilient and united, stand ready to support the victims, their families, and the brave men and women on the front lines of this disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Kentucky has been thrust into the national spotlight following the catastrophic collapse of a coal preparation plant in Martin County, resulting in a tragic loss of life and leaving another worker trapped amidst the rubble.

The collapse, which occurred late Tuesday, has sent shockwaves throughout the community and the state at large.

During an appearance on the Joe Rogan Show, Musk did not hold back his criticisms, expressing his concerns about the detrimental impact Soros is having on society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soros, a name synonymous with political donations and controversial global influence, has long been a divisive figure in American politics. Musk’s assertion that Soros is actively contributing to the decline of civilization aligns with the sentiments of many conservatives who have scrutinized Soros’s funding of progressive district attorneys and his role in shaping policy at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk emphasized Soros’s cunning ability to exploit loopholes and manipulate systems for personal and ideological gain. He highlighted Soros’s history of financial maneuvers, including his infamous shorting of the British pound, drawing parallels between his financial strategies and political machinations. Soros’s ability to spot ‘value for money’ in local races, Musk argues, allows him to exert influence in a way that is both cost-effective and insidiously impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, a figure admired by many for his entrepreneurial spirit and his willingness to challenge the status quo, is using his platform to shine a light on what he sees as a grave threat to the values and institutions that uphold society. His message is clear: George Soros’s actions and the ideologies he funds are contributing to a degradation of law and order, and his influence needs to be critically examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soros’s contributions to the Democratic party, his funding of progressive district attorneys, and his influence on local elections represent a challenge to conservative values and the rule of law. Musk’s conversation with Rogan serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and the importance of holding those with power and influence accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fight for the soul of America, voices like Musk’s are invaluable. They serve as a counterpoint to the narratives pushed by those who seek to undermine the fabric of society for ideological gain. As we navigate these turbulent times, it is crucial to remain informed, stay engaged, and stand up for the values that make America great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By highlighting Soros’s influence and the risks it poses, Musk has once again proven himself to be a thought leader unafraid to tackle the tough issues and speak out against those he believes are harming humanity. The conservative audience, ever watchful for threats to their values and way of life, will no doubt take Musk’s words to heart, fueling the ongoing debate about George Soros’s role in American politics and the broader global stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Tesla CEO and renowned entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has recently taken a bold stance against billionaire Democrat donor George Soros, accusing him of ‘eroding the fabric of civilization’ and harboring a deep-seated hatred for humanity.

This bombshell assertion raises numerous questions about the integrity of Biden’s financial dealings and his potential vulnerability to foreign influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money, allegedly originating from China’s CEFC and channeled through Hunter Biden, was described as a ‘loan repayment’ from James to Joe Biden. However, this transaction raises alarm bells considering the close ties between the Biden family and Chinese Communist Party-linked entities. Comer’s investigation, rooted in bank records and a meticulous following of the money trail, exposes a complex web of transactions designed to benefit the Biden family financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accusation that money from a Chinese company ended up in the personal account of Joe Biden is not just a financial scandal; it is potentially a significant national security threat. Comer suggests that Biden has “exposed himself to future blackmail” from Beijing, putting America’s interests at risk. The Biden family’s business dealings with China have long been a subject of contention and criticism, and this latest development only adds fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oversight Committee’s relentless pursuit of the truth has revealed more than just this single transaction. Comer asserts that the Biden family, their business associates, and related companies have received over $24 million from entities in China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Romania between 2014 and 2019. This international money trail, benefiting from Joe Biden’s political clout, is a concerning pattern that warrants thorough investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For conservatives and many Americans concerned about transparency and accountability, these revelations are a stark reminder of the need for vigilance. The Biden family’s financial dealings with foreign entities, especially those linked to adversarial governments, are a matter of national concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of political turmoil and distrust, getting to the bottom of these allegations is not just about partisan politics; it is about safeguarding the integrity of American democracy and ensuring that no individual, regardless of their position, is above the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House has attempted to downplay these allegations, emphasizing Biden’s status as a private citizen during the time of these transactions. However, the American people deserve a clear and transparent investigation to ensure that their leaders are acting in the best interests of the nation, free from foreign influence and financial entanglements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we await further developments in this investigation, it is crucial for the media, lawmakers, and the public to remain vigilant and demand transparency and accountability.

Local bank branches are shuttering across the city at an alarming rate, with 20 branches closing their doors through Oct. 28 this year alone. This trend is not just a local issue; it’s part of a nationwide crisis where financial institutions are vanishing, leaving residents without essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s descent into chaos, marked by crime, homelessness, and a drug epidemic, has created a hostile environment for businesses. The Democratic policies that dominate San Francisco’s political landscape have only exacerbated these issues, leading to a surge in crime rates and creating an unsafe atmosphere that has driven businesses away. As a result, many banks have been forced to close, often without warning, leaving residents and local businesses scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the closures in San Francisco this year surpass the total number of closures from the previous two years combined. It’s a shocking trend that speaks volumes about the dire state of the city’s economy and safety. From the central Richmond District to Bayview, no area has been spared, underscoring the pervasive nature of this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California as a whole is not faring much better, with 277 bank branches closing statewide so far this year, a number second only to the record set in 2020 when 325 branches shuttered. These closures are a stark contrast to the mere eight branch openings that have occurred statewide this year, painting a grim picture of the financial landscape in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these closures can be attributed to the move to online banking and industry-wide consolidation, many are directly tied to the city’s ongoing exodus of retail businesses, a situation worsened by persistent shoplifting problems and the inability of local authorities to address these issues effectively. The commercial center of San Francisco, once bustling with activity, is now struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to remote work, further hampered by the Democrat-led city’s failure to address the rising crime rates and create a safe and secure environment for businesses and residents alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alarming trend of bank closures is a clear indication that the policies of the Democrat-led city are failing its residents. The lack of action to address the rising crime rates, combined with the economic fallout from the pandemic, has created a perfect storm that is driving businesses away and leaving the city in disarray. As conservatives, we must stand firm in our commitment to law and order, economic prosperity, and the well-being of our communities, and hold those in power accountable for their failure to uphold these principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">San Francisco, once a booming city of prosperity, now faces a devastating economic decline.
