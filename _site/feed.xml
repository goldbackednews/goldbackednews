A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/27/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-27T11:15:32-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-27T11:15:32-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/27/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/27/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Battleground in the Tar Heel State: Republicans Defend North Carolina’s New Election Law</title><link href="/news/2023/10/27/Election-Law-North-Carolina/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Battleground in the Tar Heel State: Republicans Defend North Carolina’s New Election Law" /><published>2023-10-27T10:35:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-27T10:35:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/27/Election-Law-North-Carolina</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/27/Election-Law-North-Carolina/">&lt;p&gt;In the face of a Democrat-backed legal challenge, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the North Carolina Republican Party (NCGOP) are taking a stand to defend the state’s newly established election law. Senate Bill 747, the focal point of this legal battleground, represents a significant effort to enhance election integrity in the Tar Heel State, with Republicans emphasizing its role in promoting transparency, voter ID strength, and safeguarding poll watchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enacted on October 10th, following a Republican-led override of Democratic Governor Roy Cooper’s veto, Senate Bill 747 has become a flashpoint in the ongoing debate over voting rights and election security. The law’s provisions, aimed at tightening the deadline for mail-in ballots, ensuring robust voter ID requirements, and protecting the role of poll watchers, have garnered praise from Republicans for their potential to secure the election process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this legislative move was swiftly met with opposition from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the North Carolina Democratic Party, who filed a lawsuit alleging that the law suppresses voters’ rights and violates both the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. In their legal challenge, the Democrats accuse the law of being “a direct assault on the ‘most fundamental’ right to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to these accusations, the RNC and NCGOP have decided to intervene, expressing their intent to defend the law’s provisions and highlight their importance in maintaining a secure and transparent election process. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, in a statement to Fox News Digital, criticized President Biden for his administration’s legal actions against state voting laws, urging him to focus on addressing the nation’s pressing issues instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republicans’ legal filing counters the Democrats’ allegations, emphasizing the need for “fair election-litigation procedures” and defending the law’s measures as “common-sense” safeguards supported by the majority of American voters. Citing a 2021 Axis Research study, the filing highlights broad public support for stronger voter ID requirements and the belief that state legislatures should dictate voting rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With North Carolina positioned as a crucial battleground state for the 2024 presidential election, the outcome of this legal challenge holds significant implications. The state, which has predominantly leaned Republican in recent presidential elections, saw former President Donald Trump secure victory by a narrow margin in 2020, underscoring the importance of election laws and voter mobilization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both parties prepare for the 2024 electoral showdown, the battle over Senate Bill 747 exemplifies the broader national debate over voting rights and election integrity. With Republicans resolute in their defense of the law, and Democrats equally determined in their legal challenge, North Carolina becomes a key arena in the fight to shape the future of American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In the face of a Democrat-backed legal challenge, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the North Carolina Republican Party (NCGOP) are taking a stand to defend the state’s newly established election law.

This move, intended as a response to the growing number of content restrictions in various states, has sparked a significant backlash and raised questions about the role of education in today’s politically charged climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publisher created a separate package of books, titled “Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice,” giving schools the option to include these titles in their book fairs. While some have criticized this move as exclusionary, it is crucial to examine the broader context and consider the importance of upholding traditional values in education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where ‘woke’ ideologies are increasingly prevalent, infiltrating various aspects of society including education, it is essential to stand firm in our commitment to preserve the integrity of our educational content. The term ‘woke’ has come to represent a set of beliefs that emphasize political correctness and social justice, often at the expense of free speech and diverse perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholastic’s decision to segregate these books, while controversial, can also be seen as a response to the concerns of parents and educators who wish to protect their children from indoctrination and ensure that they receive a balanced education. The inclusion of books that promote particular ideologies should not be done at the expense of academic rigor and intellectual diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their statement, Scholastic acknowledged the backlash and announced the discontinuation of the “Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice” collection starting in January. However, they failed to provide a clear strategy for the future, leaving many wondering about their commitment to upholding educational standards and resisting the pressures of political correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital for educators, parents, and students to remain engaged and vigilant in the face of challenges to our educational system. We must strive to provide our children with an education that is grounded in tradition, promotes critical thinking, and prepares them to navigate the complexities of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

The prime suspect, Pedro Argote, has been the subject of an intense manhunt since the incident, a search that has finally come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of October 26, Argote’s lifeless body was discovered in a secluded, wooded area near Williamsport, Maryland, approximately a mile from where he had abandoned his vehicle post-crime. The discovery was made around 11 a.m., according to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, which quickly issued a press release to inform the public and bring a measure of closure to this harrowing case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Brian Albert addressed the media in a brief press conference later in the afternoon, revealing that Argote’s remains would be sent to Baltimore for an autopsy. This procedure will hopefully shed light on the circumstances of his death, including the cause, manner, and exact time of his passing. Sheriff Albert remained tight-lipped about whether a weapon was found near Argote’s body, choosing not to comment on that specific detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death of Judge Wilkinson was a result of a targeted attack, rooted in a bitter divorce and custody battle that had culminated just days before the shooting. Argote, facing allegations of prolonged abuse toward his family, had lost custody of his four children, aged 3 to 12, and was barred from any contact with them. The judge’s ruling was a decisive move to protect the children and their mother from further harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson’s family, reeling from the loss, has found a semblance of peace in the wake of Argote’s death. “The family was relieved that we brought this to a little bit of closure,” shared Sheriff Albert, acknowledging the profound impact this resolution has had on the judge’s loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident has raised questions and concerns about the safety of legal professionals, particularly judges, who make impactful and sometimes controversial decisions as part of their duties. Sheriff Albert hinted at future discussions aimed at enhancing protective measures for judges, ensuring that they can serve justice without fearing for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

The resolution, H.R. 771, which also reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for Israel, witnessed overwhelming bipartisan approval but faced resistance from these members, sparking outrage and condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Representative Jason Smith of Missouri did not hold back his criticisms, lambasting the “Squad” members and other Democrats for their refusal to back the resolution. Speaking on “The Brian Kilmeade Show,” Smith labeled their actions as a “complete disgrace” and questioned their fitness to serve in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those nine Democrats are a complete disgrace,” Smith remarked vehemently. He pointed out that Cori Bush, a member of the “Squad” from his home state, has advocated for defunding the police while representing a city that, per capita, experiences more murders than any other in the United States. Smith argued that these members are irrational, accusing them of wishing to destroy society and of promoting propaganda that is as misleading as possible. He emphasized, “The fact that they’re harboring and supporting terrorists who have killed more Jewish people since the Holocaust is absolutely unacceptable and these people do not deserve to serve in the halls of Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 members who voted against the resolution included six of the eight “Squad” members: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Jamaal Bowman of New York, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, and Cori Bush of Missouri. They were joined by André Carson of Indiana, Al Green of Texas, and Delia Ramirez of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, two “Squad” members, Greg Casar of Texas and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, chose to vote present, alongside Joaquin Castro of Texas, Nydia Velázquez of New York, Jesús “Chuy” Garcia of Illinois, and Pramila Jayapal of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky also voted against the resolution, but he explicitly condemned the Hamas attack and affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself, unlike some members of the “Squad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution’s passage with an overwhelming majority of 412-10, despite the notable dissenting votes, sends a clear message of America’s solidarity with Israel. However, the “Squad” members’ refusal to condemn Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, has ignited a fiery debate about their stance on Israel and their commitment to combating terrorism, placing them under intense scrutiny and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The political atmosphere in Congress took a tense turn as a group of House Democrats, predominantly from the far-left “Squad,” voted against a resolution condemning the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists. The resolution, H.R. 771, which also reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for Israel, witnessed overwhelming bipartisan approval but faced resistance from these members, sparking outrage and condemnation. Republican Representative Jason Smith of Missouri did not hold back his criticisms, lambasting the “Squad” members and other Democrats for their refusal to back the resolution. Speaking on “The Brian Kilmeade Show,” Smith labeled their actions as a “complete disgrace” and questioned their fitness to serve in Congress. “Those nine Democrats are a complete disgrace,” Smith remarked vehemently.

In a disappointing turn of events, the Congressman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for falsely pulling a fire alarm in a congressional office building last month, just as lawmakers were gearing up for a critical vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s actions, which could have led to a six-month jail sentence, were settled with a plea deal requiring him to pay a $1,000 fine, write an apology to the Capitol Police, and serve three months of probation. Following this period, the charge will be withdrawn. Despite these consequences, many are left questioning Bowman’s judgement and the integrity of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Bowman claimed he pulled the fire alarm in an attempt to open emergency doors to make it to a vote in time. However, this explanation quickly fell apart as Breitbart News exposed that he had discarded emergency warning signs before pulling the alarm and exiting the building from a different floor, blatantly contradicting his story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing the media, Bowman admitted to his actions, expressing regret for the confusion and disturbance caused. He acknowledged breaking D.C. law but seemed to downplay the gravity of his actions. “I really regret that this caused so much confusion and that people had to evacuate, and I just caused a disturbance. I hate that. It’s pretty embarrassing,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, his apology and admission do little to excuse his reckless behavior. Prosecutors were ready to prove that he knowingly pulled the alarm without any emergency and failed to immediately inform Capitol Police of his actions. His admission of guilt has prompted Republican lawmakers to draft a resolution seeking his expulsion from Congress, a move that underscores the severity of his misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowman’s attempt to paint his actions as a misunderstanding does not hold water. He continues to claim he did not intend to disrupt congressional proceedings, but the evidence and his admission say otherwise. He broke the law, and now he must face the consequences of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident serves as a stark reminder that elected officials are not above the law and must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their political affiliations or positions. Bowman’s irresponsible behavior has not only damaged his own reputation but has also cast a shadow on the integrity of congressional proceedings, raising concerns about the standards to which our elected officials are held.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">New York Representative Jamaal Bowman’s recent misconduct in the Capitol has raised eyebrows and drawn criticism from various quarters.

House Bill 4, designed to empower local police forces to arrest and deport illegal migrants, has cleared the state house, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate surrounding immigration policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst a turbulent political climate, the Texas legislature has allocated over $1 billion for the construction of border barriers and has taken steps to increase sentences for human trafficking offenses. House Bill 4, however, stands out as it directly challenges federal jurisdiction over immigration matters, granting unprecedented authority to state and local law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression of these bills follows hours of heated debate in the state house, with emotions running high on both sides of the aisle. State Rep. Cody Harris of Palestine played a crucial role in moving the bill forward, calling to block new amendments and subsequently bringing the debate to an end. The bill passed with a majority vote of 84-60, though not without leaving a significant impact on the representatives present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Rep. Armando Lucio Walle of Houston expressed his deep frustration following the bill’s passage, highlighting the personal and emotional toll these political debates have on individuals and communities alike. “It hurts us to our f—ing core,” Walle told Harris, emphasizing the profound disconnect and lack of understanding that he believes exists between the bill’s supporters and those it will affect most directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As House Bill 4 makes its way to the state Senate, where Republicans hold a majority, it is widely expected to pass and become law. Proponents of the bill, such as State Rep. David Spille from Fort Worth, argue that it represents a “humane, logical, and efficient approach” to addressing illegal immigration. Spille asserts that there is nothing unfair about “ordering someone back from where they came if they arrived here illegally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While supporters celebrate the bill’s advancement, it is essential to recognize the broader context of this legislative action. The Biden administration recently released new border numbers for September, revealing a record-breaking number of encounters and marking FY 23 as a year of unprecedented immigration challenges. Amidst these challenges, the administration has reiterated its opposition to border walls, even as it takes steps to address urgent needs in South Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the nation watches closely, the passage of House Bill 4 in Texas may very well set a precedent for how state and local governments engage with federal immigration policies in the future. The bill’s progress serves as a testament to the complex and often contentious nature of immigration policy in the United States, highlighting the need for comprehensive and thoughtful solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure the fair and humane treatment of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a move to strengthen border security, the Texas state House of Representatives has successfully passed a series of bills, with one in particular drawing significant attention.

Health experts from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have pinpointed this potential risk while analyzing Medicare claims data, putting a spotlight on the need for careful consideration when it comes to vaccine combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, which follows a previous report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA, highlighted a potential risk of strokes caused by blood clots in the brains of older adults receiving both vaccines on the same day. While the overall risk remains low—approximately 3 in 100,000 doses—the study’s findings are significant enough to warrant further investigation and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serious side effect appears to be triggered specifically by the high-dose or adjuvanted flu shot, which is designed to elicit a stronger immune response. Interestingly, further analysis indicated a slight increased risk even for seniors aged 65 and older who only received the flu shot, correlating to an additional 1-2 strokes per 100,000 doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steve Nissen, a respected cardiologist and researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, emphasized that “the absolute risk is minuscule,” especially when compared to the grave risks posed by COVID-19 to individuals over the age of 85. However, the findings are still crucial for informed decision-making when it comes to vaccination strategies for older populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC is actively following up on these preliminary findings with additional studies to understand the full extent of the potential risk. Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, director of the Immunization Safety Office at the CDC, reiterated that the current data does not provide “clear and consistent evidence” of a safety problem, but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts continue to underline the importance of vaccination for older adults, particularly given their increased vulnerability to severe outcomes from both the flu and COVID-19. However, for those concerned about potential risks, spacing out the vaccines by about two weeks could be a viable option to minimize interactions and potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s investigation found no increase in stroke risk for individuals over 65 who received either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, though a slight increase in risk was noted for those 85 and older who received the Pfizer shot. Regardless, the findings underscore the need for a nuanced approach to vaccination for older adults, ensuring that the benefits of protection against severe disease are carefully weighed against potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the study awaits peer review, the healthcare community remains vigilant, continuing to explore and understand the complexities of vaccine interactions to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals, particularly our most vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A recent study has raised concerns about the potential risks associated with administering the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot simultaneously, particularly for seniors above the age of 85.
