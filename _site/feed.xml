A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html"></title><link href="/2023/10/24/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2023-10-24T12:20:03-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-24T12:20:03-04:00</updated><id>/2023/10/24/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/10/24/2023-10-08-Squad-Controversy-Israel/">&lt;p&gt;Recent surprise attacks by Hamas on Israel has fueled ongoing tensions between staunchly conservative commentators and the progressive “Squad” Democrats known for criticizing Israel. The intensity of the backlash highlights the deep political divide over foreign policy in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hamas’ shocking attack, several members of the “Squad,” including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for a “ceasefire and de-escalation,” condemning the violence. The absence of a statement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was notably called out by conservative media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace quickly labeled Ocasio-Cortez a “Hamas apologist” in response to her call for peace and de-escalation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), no stranger to controversy surrounding her views on Israel, echoed the call for de-escalation and ceasefire. Omar’s prior statements comparing the US and Israel to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban resurfaced in the debate, fueling more criticisms. Omar’s 2019 tweet, where she opined that “Israel has hypnotized the world,” also continues to haunt her political career, often cited by critics to challenge her stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentators have been especially vocal. “FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy took aim at Omar, saying she fails to recognize the peace in the Middle East under Trump’s administration. Conservative pundit John Hasson also called out Omar, claiming she insinuated that attacks on IDF forces were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s concerns over the “devastating attacks on Israelis” were met with skepticism. A prominent conservative online personality, Comfortably Smug, accused the “Squad” of advising Israel to back down after the nation suffered massive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s call for an end to the Gaza blockade, in addition to condemning the Hamas attacks, was met with criticism from conservative radio host Jason Rantz. He accused Bowman of pairing his condemnation of terrorism with unwarranted criticisms of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, while pushing for an end to “U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.” Defense attorney Marina Medvin criticized Bush, suggesting that she equates the death of Palestinian terrorists to the horrific acts committed against Jewish civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the political turmoil and intense debate, the attacks have taken a heavy toll. Israeli media report over 300 dead due to the wide-ranging assault. Gaza health officials note that at least 200 Palestinians have perished in the retaliatory Israeli air strikes following the initial Hamas attack. As the situation remains volatile, both sides continue to count their casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divisive issue showcases the challenge America faces in crafting a unified approach to foreign policy, with deeply entrenched political divides at play. As the situation develops, the debate is bound to intensify, shedding light on the complexities of U.S. politics in the global arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital Warfare: Uncovering Iran’s Propaganda Tactics on Chinese TikTok</title><link href="/news/2023/10/24/Iran-TikTok-Propaganda/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital Warfare: Uncovering Iran’s Propaganda Tactics on Chinese TikTok" /><published>2023-10-24T11:49:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-24T11:49:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/10/24/Iran-TikTok-Propaganda</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/10/24/Iran-TikTok-Propaganda/">&lt;p&gt;The digital space is the new battlefield for geopolitical conflicts, and the latest reports reveal a disturbing trend: Iran is actively using Douyin, the Chinese counterpart of TikTok, to spread propaganda about the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. This move underscores the complexity of modern warfare, where battles are fought not just with weapons but with information and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ByteDance, a Beijing-based company, owns Douyin, and it seems to have become a platform for the Iranian embassy in China to express its views and garner support. Newsweek’s recent coverage highlights the embassy’s sympathetic stance toward Hamas, particularly in relation to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel. The embassy’s account goes further to lay blame on the United States and Israel, accusing them of aiming to obliterate Hamas’ control over the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the conflict’s inception, the embassy has strategically used short, impactful videos to draw attention to the destruction in Gaza, attracting hundreds of thousands of views. Some videos explicitly label Israel as a “terrorist” nation, while others share footage of explosion aftermaths, blaming Israel for the devastation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular post shared by the embassy features footage from the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City post-explosion. The embassy attributes the destruction to Israel, despite U.S. intelligence indicating that the damage was actually caused by a failed rocket launch by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, a group closely aligned with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a blatant display of antisemitism, another Iranian post on Douyin depicts rockets raining down on Gaza, emanating from the hair of a grotesque caricature of a Jewish person. This sort of hateful content is not only spreading misinformation but also fostering animosity and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amplifying Iran’s propaganda efforts, Chinese state media outlets have reposted and supported the Iranian embassy’s claims on Sina Weibo, another popular social media platform in China. The concerted efforts of these entities have led to a significant increase in the embassy’s influence on Douyin, now boasting over 1.3 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing, while maintaining robust political and trade relationships with Iran, presents itself as a peace broker in the Middle East conflict. However, it’s crucial to highlight that the country has yet to denounce Hamas’ actions or its connections to Iran, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. Marshals, backed by SWAT teams, experienced gunfire through a closed apartment door, escalating the situation to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon breaching the apartment, officers discovered 23-year-old Christian Williams, a suspect in a 2021 murder case who vanished under mysterious circumstances seven months ago. The suspect was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and is currently in critical condition at a local hospital. This incident marks the first time Williams has been seen since his reported abduction on March 6, just hours before his scheduled court appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams is suspected of assisting Joey Fournier (52), Chavis Stokes (29), Marc K. Anderson (24), and Johnifer Barnwell (37) in their escape from Bibbs County Jail. The inmates managed a daring escape, climbing out of a damaged window and cutting through a fence before making their getaway in a blue Dodge Challenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the suspected getaway vehicle in a parking lot near the jail has not brought the fugitives any closer to capture, as the search continues into its second week. The Bibb County Sheriff’s Office, while releasing few details, has confirmed that Williams’s involvement in the jailbreak is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, present at the scene, was arrested and charged with felony aiding or permitting another to escape lawful custody or confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current status of the escaped inmates remains uncertain, with the Bibb County Sheriff admitting during a press conference that “They could be anywhere…But how long they stay together or even if they’re together at this point: We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement has placed a $73,000 reward on the heads of the fugitives, a combination of contributions from the FBI, Macon Regional Crime Stoppers, U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tumultuous incident shines a spotlight on the intricate and often dangerous nature of manhunts, underscoring the lengths to which law enforcement will go to apprehend escapees and solve outstanding cases. As the situation continues to develop, the public and law enforcement alike are left on edge, wondering where the escapees will turn up next and what further revelations this intense manhunt will bring to light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The search for four escaped Georgia inmates took a violent turn, leading armed law enforcement teams straight to the doorstep of a missing murder suspect, resulting in a confrontation that ended in gunfire.

The suit alleges that the DHS is concealing critical details about a policy implemented in July 2021, designed to permit certain deported illegal aliens, particularly those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, to return to the United States, despite having been previously expelled due to criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This controversial policy has sparked fierce debate, as critics argue it exploits the American public’s support for military veterans, while potentially compromising national security by allowing individuals with criminal histories back into the country. The IRLI is pushing back, demanding answers and transparency on this issue, with Executive Director Dale Wilcox stating, “This administration has made clear its desire to keep criminal aliens in the country, and now they are exploiting the American people’s support of military veterans to allow more potentially dangerous aliens to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit stems from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted by the IRLI in April of this year, seeking access to all documentation, policies, and case details related to the DHS initiative focusing on the return of deported non-citizen veterans. Despite acknowledgment of the request, the DHS has yet to provide any determination, prompting the IRLI to take legal action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, highlights a critical issue at the intersection of immigration, national security, and transparency. It asks the federal court to mandate the DHS to disclose all relevant information pertaining to this ‘Special Amnesty’ policy, ensuring that the public is fully informed about the actions and intentions of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of Investigations at IRLI, Matt O’Brien, emphasizes the need for scrutiny, questioning the appropriateness of a policy that seemingly grants special treatment to foreign criminals, solely based on their brief service in the U.S. military. He raises concerns about the lack of oversight and the potential legal and ethical ramifications of such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lawsuit progresses, it represents not just a quest for transparency, but also a challenge to the ethical and legal standards of immigration policies. It underscores the need for a balanced approach that honors the service of military veterans while also safeguarding the nation’s security and upholding the rule of law. The outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications, potentially setting precedents for how similar cases are handled in the future and ensuring that the government remains accountable to the people it serves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), led by President Joe Biden.

In a letter addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the representatives have requested a comprehensive briefing to understand the Department of Defense’s (DoD) monitoring strategies and actions taken to prevent American arms from bolstering terrorist activities against Israel, a key ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter, penned by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), highlights the urgency of the matter, calling for Austin’s presence on Capitol Hill next Monday. The representatives express their concerns, citing reports of U.S. arms being redirected from conflict zones in Afghanistan and Ukraine to terrorist groups, specifically Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Examiner reported that the letter explicitly mentions the redistribution and resale of U.S.-manufactured weapons in secondary markets, leading to their acquisition by terrorist entities. Comer and Greene are seeking detailed information on the DoD’s “procedures for preventing, addressing, and mitigating weapon diversion abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent incidents have underscored the gravity of the situation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) shared an image captured on October 5, showcasing a Hamas terrorist wielding an M-16, a weapon of U.S. origin, moments before the IDF neutralized the threat. Additionally, a defense official from Ukraine raised alarms about Russia’s involvement, suggesting that Moscow is supplying Hamas with confiscated U.S. trophy weapons from the Ukrainian battlefield — a tactic aimed at tarnishing Ukraine’s reputation among its Western allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene took to social media on October 8, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts with Israel to trace U.S. weapons used against them, raising questions about their origins – Afghanistan, Ukraine, or possibly both. She underlines the critical need for accountability and stringent tracking to prevent such security lapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backdrop to these developments is the chaotic and much-criticized withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August 2021, during which $7.12 billion worth of military equipment was left behind. This equipment, originally intended for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, inadvertently armed the Taliban, effectively transforming them into a potential arms supplier for global terrorist networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the current geopolitical climate, with over $45 billion in military assistance provided to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, House Republicans are keen to prevent a recurrence of the Afghanistan debacle. The State Department, in a statement to Newsweek in June, assured proactive steps are being taken in cooperation with the Ukrainian government to mitigate the risks of weapon diversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter from Comer and Greene signifies a critical inquiry, as they seek transparency and details on these mitigation strategies, ensuring that American weaponry does not inadvertently empower those with malicious intentions against the U.S. and its allies. The outcomes of this inquiry could have significant implications for future military aid and weapon distribution policies, underlining the importance of robust monitoring and accountability in international military engagements.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">House Republicans have taken a bold step to demand answers regarding the alarming trend of U.S. weaponry ending up in the hands of Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization.

The suit alleges that Anthropic unlawfully utilized copyrighted song lyrics from a variety of artists, from Beyonce to Don McLean, to enhance its chatbot technology, known as Claude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Claude is a sophisticated chatbot designed to interact with users in a natural and intuitive manner. It was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet, learning to generate responses to user prompts. However, this lawsuit claims that Anthropic stepped over legal boundaries by incorporating lyrics from over 500 distinct songs without obtaining the necessary permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music publishers point out that Claude doesn’t just reproduce copyrighted lyrics in response to direct requests. Its capabilities extend to generating lyrics in response to a wide array of prompts, such as asking it to create songs, provide chord progressions, or craft poetry in the style of particular artists or songwriters. This, they argue, amounts to an unlawful reproduction of copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when prompted to write a song about the death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly, Claude reportedly provided lyrics from Don McLean’s “American Pie.” The music publishers’ attorney, Matt Oppenheim, was clear on the legal standpoint: “it’s well-established by copyright law that an entity cannot reproduce, distribute, and display someone else’s copyrighted works to build its own business unless it secures permission from rights holders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal battle draws attention to the increasingly complex interactions between artificial intelligence and copyright law, as AI technologies become more advanced and integrated into various sectors of business and creativity. The outcome of this lawsuit could set a significant precedent for how AI startups and tech companies at large handle copyrighted material in their products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this lawsuit comes at a pivotal moment for Anthropic. The AI startup recently entered into a major investment deal with Amazon, which includes making Amazon its primary cloud computing service and providing access to Amazon’s custom chips for training and deploying its generative AI systems. With such technological advancements on the line, the music industry’s lawsuit adds an extra layer of complexity to Anthropic’s path forward, possibly influencing how other AI companies approach the use of copyrighted material in their technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Major players in the music publishing world, including Universal Music, ABKCO, and Concord Publishing, have filed a lawsuit against the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, putting the tech world on notice. The suit alleges that Anthropic unlawfully utilized copyrighted song lyrics from a variety of artists, from Beyonce to Don McLean, to enhance its chatbot technology, known as Claude. Anthropic’s Claude is a sophisticated chatbot designed to interact with users in a natural and intuitive manner. It was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet, learning to generate responses to user prompts. However, this lawsuit claims that Anthropic stepped over legal boundaries by incorporating lyrics from over 500 distinct songs without obtaining the necessary permissions.

This suspension has been in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and with this extension, students in Oregon will not be required to demonstrate proficiency in core academic areas such as reading, writing, or math to earn their high school diploma until at least the 2027-2028 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board justified its decision by stating that the basic skills requirement disproportionately harms students of color, as well as students with disabilities and those learning English as a second language. However, this explanation has not quelled the concerns of critics who believe that the suspension could devalue Oregon high school diplomas and leave graduates unprepared for future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Republican gubernatorial candidate Christine Drazan has been particularly vocal in her opposition to the board’s decision. She has expressed fears that the suspension of these academic standards could result in Oregon diplomas resembling “participation prizes” rather than certificates of academic achievement. Drazan has urged the state to maintain rigorous academic standards to ensure that students are adequately prepared for life after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these concerns, the Oregon State Board of Education voted unanimously to continue the suspension of the graduation requirement. Under the original requirement, 11th graders were required to demonstrate competence in essential academic subjects through standardized testing or work samples. Those who failed to meet the standards were required to take additional classes in math and writing during their senior year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of the board’s decision have expressed concern that lowering academic standards could harm students in the long run, leaving them ill-equipped for college or the workforce. Hundreds of public comments were submitted in opposition to the move, many of which were generated through a call to action from Drazan’s advocacy group, A New Direction Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Board Chair Guadalupe Martinez Zapata dismissed the opposition as a “campaign of misinformation,” defending the decision as a step toward educational equity. However, this stance has not silenced critics who argue that maintaining high academic standards is crucial for the success of all students, regardless of their background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oregon has one of the lowest graduation rates in the country, yet it also has some of the most rigorous credit requirements. The suspension of the basic skills requirement raises questions about the balance between maintaining high standards and ensuring equitable access to education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drazan has called on concerned parents and community members to voice their concerns to Governor Tina Kotek’s office, emphasizing the need for the education board to be more responsive to the needs of students and families. As the debate over academic standards in Oregon continues, the future of the state’s education system hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">The Oregon State Board of Education has decided to extend the suspension of basic skills graduation requirements for high schoolers for an additional five years.

The celebrity’s public call to action highlights the mounting frustration and urgency felt by many as the situation overseas continues to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing a news report that shows Biden relaxing at his Rehoboth Beach home while Israel faces a severe crisis and Congress is embroiled in chaos, 50 Cent made his feelings clear: “Hey Joe get the fvck up, we in trouble man!” This stark message has resonated with thousands, as it echoes the growing concern over the President’s apparent detachment during a time of international turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post brings attention to the dire circumstances in the Middle East, where Israel is grappling with an onslaught of terrorist attacks from Hamas, resulting in the tragic loss of over 1,400 lives, mostly civilians. The rapper’s call to action underscores the need for decisive leadership and immediate engagement, especially when the stability of a region and the lives of innocent people are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden, 80, had just returned from a brief yet intense trip to Israel, where he spent seven hours on the ground, meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and those directly affected by Hamas’ brutal October 7 terror attack. However, instead of capitalizing on the momentum from this diplomatic endeavor, the President chose to retreat to his Delaware beach home, a decision that has since become a focal point of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the nation on Friday, Biden attempted to link the aid and support needed by Israel to that of Ukraine, drawing parallels between their respective struggles against aggressors seeking to obliterate their democracies. He likened Hamas’ actions to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, emphasizing their shared objective of annihilating neighboring democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strong rhetoric, 50 Cent’s Instagram post captures a sentiment shared by many Americans—that in times of international crisis, the nation’s leader must be fully engaged, visible, and ready to take decisive action. The rapper’s explicit call for President Biden to ‘get up’ and tackle the crisis head-on serves as a powerful reminder of the urgency and gravity of the situation, urging the President to rise to the occasion and lead with conviction and urgency.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pat Franklin</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><summary type="html">Amid escalating tensions and violence in the Middle East, rapper 50 Cent has taken to Instagram to deliver a bold and explicit message to President Joe Biden: “Get the f**k up” from your beach vacation and address the crisis.

Drake Jr., the 38-year-old estranged son of Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake. Drake Jr., with a lengthy criminal history and registered as a sex offender, is now the prime suspect in the shooting of two suburban police officers. The incident has spurred an intensive manhunt, putting local communities on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The officers, Ashely Boleyjack and Gregory Kern of La Vergne Police Department, are currently in stable condition after the brutal encounter on Saturday. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant as the search for Drake Jr. intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident unfolded around 2:30 p.m. outside a Dollar General store in La Vergne, roughly 20 miles southeast of Nashville. During a “struggle” with the officers, who were investigating a stolen car, Drake Jr. is accused of pulling out a gun and shooting both officers — one in the back and the other multiple times. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has since issued warrants for his arrest on two counts of attempted first-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drake Jr. is no stranger to law enforcement, with a criminal record spanning back to 2005, including dozens of prior arrests. His rap sheet reveals convictions for rape in 2009 and additional sex offenses over the past decade. Other charges include domestic violence, assault, unlawful possession of a weapon, evading arrest, and multiple violations of the state’s sex offender registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his estranged relationship and troubled past, Police Chief John Drake issued a statement urging his son to be held accountable. “He has not been a part of my life for quite some time. He now needs to be found and held accountable for his actions today,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The La Vergne Police Department has described Drake Jr. as a 5 feet, 11 inches tall male, with a muscular build, facial hair, and dreadlocks, last seen wearing a black T-shirt with a white hockey mask emblem and gray pants. He is considered armed and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities have lifted the shelter-in-place order in La Vergne but continue to ask the public to remain cautious and report any suspicious activity. Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell expressed his support for Chief Drake and the wounded officers, acknowledging the complex emotions involved when a family member is implicated in such a heinous act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the manhunt enters its second day, the community and law enforcement alike hope for a swift resolution, ensuring justice for the injured officers and safety for the residents of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Tennessee law enforcement is in a race against time, searching for John C.
