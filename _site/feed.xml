A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Train Travels - Migrants’ New Path to Texas</title><link href="/news/2023/09/21/Migrant-Journey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Train Travels - Migrants’ New Path to Texas" /><published>2023-09-21T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-21T11:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/21/Migrant-Journey</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/21/Migrant-Journey/">&lt;p&gt;The path to a new life can be hard.

&lt;p&gt;Migrants, in search of a brighter future, have turned to trains as their way into Piedras Negras, Coahuila. This city shares its borders with Texas. From here, many hope to enter the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting their trip in the bustling industrial city of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, these determined individuals rode in and on the rail cars, moving towards their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

The area lacks the extensive border barriers and fencing seen in other regions, making it an attractive point of entry.&lt;/p&gt;

However, what’s capturing even more attention is the seemingly lenient approach the Department of Justice (DOJ) is taking toward his case, especially when considering its historical hard stance on similar matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-surprising-treatment-of-a-presidents-son&quot;&gt;The Surprising Treatment of a President’s Son&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden’s case isn’t just any case. He’s the first son of a sitting U.S. president to face criminal indictment. While it’s big news, insiders suggest that there’s more to come in this unfolding saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former federal prosecutor has expressed deep concern over how the DOJ has been conducting a five-year investigation into Hunter Biden’s case. The evidence pointing toward corruption and severe criminal actions appears evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-hunters-case-to-traditional-doj-action&quot;&gt;Comparing Hunter’s Case to Traditional DOJ Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the DOJ has been strict, particularly when dealing with firearms offenses. This approach is in line with the Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), an initiative established over two decades ago to address such offenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program has seen every attorney general’s support, even the current one, Merrick Garland. Through this initiative, countless Americans have been sentenced to an average of 40 months in federal prison for similar gun charges. However, Hunter Biden’s treatment seems to diverge from these typical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his role, the former federal prosecutor has dealt with numerous firearms cases. Never has he seen a case with such compelling evidence being settled without charges. After sifting through data of over 189,000 illegal firearms possession cases, not one was found to be given an offer of diversion by the DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-controversial-sweetheart-deal&quot;&gt;The Controversial Sweetheart Deal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It caused quite a stir when the DOJ tried to settle Hunter Biden’s case without bringing any charges and even proposed immunity for unrelated charges. But, thanks to a vigilant federal judge, that deal was stopped in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, weeks later, three indictments were filed against Hunter. These were for allegedly making false statements when buying a gun and for possessing a gun while being addicted to drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-evidence-awaiting-in-the-wings&quot;&gt;More Evidence Awaiting in the Wings?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a treasure trove of evidence against Hunter Biden. An abandoned laptop, containing compromising emails, pictures, and videos, seems to point toward serious criminal activity. This, combined with testimony from a former business associate and revelations from House committee investigations, paints a grim picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available evidence seems to indicate the creation of fake companies, collaboration of co-conspirators, and a grand scheme to earn millions from foreign entities. Yet, the DOJ’s investigation seems to overlook these potential charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-big-question&quot;&gt;The Big Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the evidence is as compelling as it appears, why aren’t Hunter and Joe Biden facing the level of scrutiny that others in similar situations have encountered? Many feel that there’s a false sense of security that they will never face serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

Ron DeSantis has dramatically fallen to fifth place. This surprising turn was found in a recent CNN New Hampshire Primary Poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trump-towers-in-the-granite-state&quot;&gt;Trump Towers in the Granite State&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the poll, Trump leads the GOP primary race with an impressive 39% support. This places him a whopping 26 points ahead of the second contender, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who gathered 13% of the votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina Governor, wasn’t far behind Ramaswamy with 12% support. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was next in line with 11%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desantis-faces-a-setback&quot;&gt;DeSantis Faces a Setback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest news from the poll was DeSantis’s decline. After announcing earlier this summer that his campaign would focus on the first three states, including New Hampshire, the latest poll reveals he has only managed to garner 10% support, placing him fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents a significant 13-point dip from a survey conducted in July, where DeSantis was shown to have 23% support in New Hampshire. Changes in his campaign strategy, staff layoffs, and a change in campaign management may have contributed to this sharp decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-deeper-dive-into-voter-sentiments&quot;&gt;A Deeper Dive into Voter Sentiments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also shed light on the commitment of the voter base. A substantial 69% of Trump supporters stated they’re sure about supporting him, while only 18% of DeSantis supporters felt the same conviction for their candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participants were questioned about which candidate they felt had the best chance to win the 2024 presidential general election, over half (51%) vouched for Trump. DeSantis lagged far behind with only 16% believing in his chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the political landscape can be unpredictable, this recent survey clearly indicates a shift in the wind.

The series, a prequel to the successful “John Wick” films, features Gibson in the role of Cormac, the manager of the New York Continental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-gibson&quot;&gt;Why Gibson?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I cast [Gibson] based on his past work that I grew up on,” Hughes said in a recent interview with the New York Post. He believes that fans will understand the casting decision once they see Gibson’s performance. “The personal stuff is not my business to talk about,” Hughes emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is thrilled about the casting. Social media has been buzzing with reactions from fans, many of whom have strong opinions on Gibson due to his past controversies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another added, “I can’t stomach watching Mel Gibson ever again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hughes isn’t fazed by the social media chatter. He explained that the casting process in Hollywood often involves narrowing down from a list of big names, based on availability and response from agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-controversial-past&quot;&gt;A Controversial Past&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibson has been a contentious figure in Hollywood since his 2006 arrest for DUI. The incident became even more controversial due to Gibson’s antisemitic remarks during the arrest. Tapes from 2010 further tarnished his image, showcasing Gibson using racist language towards his then-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the actor-director has since apologized, particularly for the antisemitic comments, saying, “There is no excuse, nor should there be any tolerance, for anyone who thinks or expresses any kind of antisemitic remark.”&lt;/p&gt;

According to Cruz, the Dems are getting increasingly “nervous” about Biden’s potential run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-big-prediction&quot;&gt;The Big Prediction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his podcast, “Verdict with Ted Cruz”, the Senator voiced that the odds of Biden not getting the Democrat nomination have “risen significantly.” Citing reasons, he pointed to polling numbers indicating two-thirds of Americans believe Biden might be too old for presidency and emerging concerns about Biden’s connections and possible corruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruz did not shy away from pointing fingers at the media. According to him, their changing stance on Biden signifies the Democrats’ contemplation of a potential change in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;michelle-obama---the-unexpected-game-changer&quot;&gt;Michelle Obama - The Unexpected Game-Changer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Democratic National Convention sees Biden’s “mental diminishment” become more evident, Cruz believes the platform will serve as a launching pad for Michelle Obama. His reasoning? Bringing in Michelle Obama would not alienate African American women voters - a significant constituent for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having served as the First Lady, Cruz argues that Michelle has the leverage to bypass other top Democratic contenders and could be viewed as the Obamas’ attempt to “save the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind The Scenes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Cruz opined that former President Barack Obama might already be the unseen hand guiding the Biden administration. “I don’t think Joe Biden is the decision maker,” Cruz stated, suggesting Barack’s influential role. He warns that if media sentiment continues to turn on Biden, the chances of seeing Michelle Obama in the 2024 race could increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering a hypothetical scenario where Biden willingly steps down, Cruz joked that the Democrats might herald him as the “biggest hero” in their history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioning Democrats as being “dynastic” and “command and control”, Cruz believes Michelle already holds a superior position within the Democratic hierarchy than most contenders.

&lt;p&gt;While the political arena is unpredictable, Cruz’s observations offer an intriguing perspective on the potential future of American politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Texas Senator Ted Cruz has sparked conversations with a bold prediction: the Democrats might opt for former First Lady Michelle Obama to replace President Joe Biden for the 2024 elections. According to Cruz, the Dems are getting increasingly “nervous” about Biden’s potential run. The Big Prediction On his podcast, “Verdict with Ted Cruz”, the Senator voiced that the odds of Biden not getting the Democrat nomination have “risen significantly.” Citing reasons, he pointed to polling numbers indicating two-thirds of Americans believe Biden might be too old for presidency and emerging concerns about Biden’s connections and possible corruptions. Cruz did not shy away from pointing fingers at the media. According to him, their changing stance on Biden signifies the Democrats’ contemplation of a potential change in leadership. Michelle Obama - The Unexpected Game-Changer? If the Democratic National Convention sees Biden’s “mental diminishment” become more evident, Cruz believes the platform will serve as a launching pad for Michelle Obama. His reasoning? Bringing in Michelle Obama would not alienate African American women voters - a significant constituent for the Democrats. Having served as the First Lady, Cruz argues that Michelle has the leverage to bypass other top Democratic contenders and could be viewed as the Obamas’ attempt to “save the day.” Behind The Scenes Moreover, Cruz opined that former President Barack Obama might already be the unseen hand guiding the Biden administration. “I don’t think Joe Biden is the decision maker,” Cruz stated, suggesting Barack’s influential role. He warns that if media sentiment continues to turn on Biden, the chances of seeing Michelle Obama in the 2024 race could increase. Considering a hypothetical scenario where Biden willingly steps down, Cruz joked that the Democrats might herald him as the “biggest hero” in their history. Final Thoughts Positioning Democrats as being “dynastic” and “command and control”, Cruz believes Michelle already holds a superior position within the Democratic hierarchy than most contenders. He concludes by suggesting that her nomination might be the “only solution” that doesn’t lead to internal strife within the party. While the political arena is unpredictable, Cruz’s observations offer an intriguing perspective on the potential future of American politics.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Future Generations at Risk? The Potential Effects of Aspartame</title><link href="/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Future Generations at Risk? The Potential Effects of Aspartame" /><published>2023-09-21T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-21T06:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/21/Aspartame-Study-Effects/">&lt;p&gt;Aspartame, a widespread zero-calorie sweetener, is making headlines again. A study from Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine indicates potential links between the sweetener and memory or learning challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unpacking-the-study&quot;&gt;Unpacking the Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from FSU carried out a 16-week experiment on mice. Three groups were set up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One consumed 15% of the FDA’s daily recommended maximum intake of aspartame (like drinking four 8-oz. sodas).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second group had 7% of the recommended maximum (equivalent to two 8-oz. sodas daily).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A control group only drank water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the experiment, the mice underwent maze tests. The results? Mice that consumed water found their way out much quicker than their aspartame-drinking counterparts. Those consuming aspartame did finish, but they struggled and often needed extra assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/672/378/mice-in-maze.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Mice in a Maze&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mice navigating through a maze. The aspartame consumers had a tougher time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;findings-and-concerns&quot;&gt;Findings and Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-author, Pradeep Bhide, shed light on the emotional connection between memory and learning. He emphasized the unique nature of the findings, pointing out that only the children (and not the grandchildren) of the male mice showed these effects. This suggests epigenetic changes in the sperm might be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these results in mind, Bhide proposed a more in-depth, multi-generational investigation of aspartame by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in June, the World Health Organization made waves by categorizing aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”. While industry experts refuted this claim, the WHO hasn’t touched on the cognitive implications highlighted by FSU’s recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a Washington, D.C.-based medical toxicology physician, weighed in. She remarked on the study’s implications: potential hereditary memory and learning problems stemming from even minimal aspartame consumption. But she also added a note of caution, stating more research is necessary to firmly establish this connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-drink-or-not-to-drink&quot;&gt;To Drink or Not to Drink?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry leaders have stepped forward to defend aspartame. The Calorie Control Council’s president, Robert Rankin, emphasized that the study’s results should not be generalized to humans. He cited the vast body of evidence and global health organizations that deem aspartame safe after rigorous evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the debate rages on, the FSU study has certainly added a new layer to the conversation surrounding artificial sweeteners and their potential effects. As research continues, consumers might consider limiting their intake or staying updated with the latest findings to make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Aspartame, a widespread zero-calorie sweetener, is making headlines again.

On Tuesday, he reintroduced the “Protecting the Right To Keep and Bear Arms Act”. This legislation, if passed, would restrict the president and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using public health emergencies as a means to enforce gun control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-amendment-under-fire&quot;&gt;Second Amendment Under Fire?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris recently expressed her support for the Second Amendment on “The Jennifer Hudson Show”. However, her endorsement for an assault weapons ban in the same conversation has raised eyebrows among conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Michael Cloud has expressed concern over the strategies of the ‘radical left’. “For a long time, radical left politicians have been open about their willingness to use executive authority and rob Americans of their Second Amendment rights,” Cloud stated, pointing out the need for his reintroduced bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for such statements and actions is clear. Last week, New Mexico’s Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, declared gun violence as a public health crisis and attempted to implement a 30-day prohibition on carrying firearms in public spaces and on state-owned properties in Albuquerque. Cloud did not hold back in his criticism, “The Biden administration, Gov. Grisham, and others have exercised extraordinary executive power to push their liberal agenda and expand the power of the government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-response&quot;&gt;The Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grisham’s bold move faced swift resistance. A judge promptly blocked the proposed 30-day gun ban. In turn, Grisham adjusted her rule to limit firearms at public parks or playgrounds, specifically mentioning areas “where we know we have high risk of kids and families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, including Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, have voiced their concerns. Johnston noted that Grisham’s utilization of a ‘public health emergency’ to suspend the Second Amendment is a troubling instance of officials potentially misusing ‘emergency powers’ to infringe on constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these concerns, Rep. Pete Sessions and Rep. Mary Miller have also shown their support for Cloud’s bill, emphasizing the importance of preserving the rights of gun owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigger-picture&quot;&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time gun violence has been referred to as a “public health crisis.” Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra used the term after a mass shooting in Atlanta. Prior to that, officials in California had made similar appeals to label gun violence as a public health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

His lawyers stated on Tuesday that he intends to plead not guilty to federal gun charges recently levied against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-charges&quot;&gt;The Charges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These charges, emerging from Special Counsel David Weiss, accuse Biden of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing an inaccurate statement linked to information that federal firearms dealers are mandated to keep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in possession of a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Hunter Biden’s legal team requests his initial court appearance be virtual, they emphasize that Biden isn’t asking for any special treatment. Since his initial plea deal crumbled earlier this year, Biden has complied with all legal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;past-controversies&quot;&gt;Past Controversies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Hunter Biden has faced legal complications. In a previously reported incident from 2018, a gun owned by Hunter was found discarded in a trash can outside a Delaware market. This gun was reportedly thrown away by Hallie Biden, widow of President Biden’s late son, Beau. Notably, Hunter had been romantically linked with Hallie at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox News also revealed that Hunter had answered “no” on a firearm transaction report when queried if he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” However, it’s essential to recall that Hunter was dismissed from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-political-storm&quot;&gt;A Political Storm?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, stated that this gun-related case poses a greater threat to the justice system than to public safety, hinting at political motivations behind the charges. Lowell declared, “Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety, but a prosecutor bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the legal proceedings unfold, the public and media outlets are keenly observing the case, eager to understand its implications not just for Hunter Biden, but also for the Biden administration as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, has recently been caught in the center of a political and legal storm.

Roberto Emilio Vasquez-Santamaria, a 64-year-old Peruvian migrant who was released by the Biden administration to pursue an asylum claim, is now the primary suspect in a murder case. The victim, a 40-year-old man from Houston, was found beaten to death in a backyard in the Loma Bonita neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maverick County Sheriff, Tom Schmerber, revealed the disturbing details of the crime scene on Cotorra Street and Progresso Avenue. The chilling incident unfolded on a Monday morning, around 9:30 a.m. While the Sheriff held back from divulging extensive details due to the ongoing investigation, other sources in law enforcement indicated that the property where the crime took place had previous ties to migrant smuggling activities.
