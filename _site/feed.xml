A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Sahel’s Power Play - Former French Colonies Forge New Defense Alliance</title><link href="/news/2023/09/22/Sahel-Defense-Alliance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sahel’s Power Play - Former French Colonies Forge New Defense Alliance" /><published>2023-09-22T07:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-22T07:01:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/22/Sahel-Defense-Alliance</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/22/Sahel-Defense-Alliance/">&lt;p&gt;Amidst a backdrop of political upheavals and security concerns, the landlocked West African nations of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have announced the formation of the Alliance of Sahel States. This alliance comes as a bold move from nations previously aligned with the G5 Sahel Alliance, a group significantly supported by France, aiming to combat terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategic-alliance-in-the-sahel&quot;&gt;A Strategic Alliance in the Sahel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries involved have witnessed military coups overturning their elected governments: Mali in 2021, Burkina Faso in 2022, and Niger in July 2023. Now, under military regimes, these nations have inked a mutual defense pact on September 16, 2023, in Bamako, known as the Liptako-Gourma Charter, which could shape regional dynamics significantly. This alliance mandates mutual defense and suppression of armed uprisings in each other’s territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sahel-states-vs-france&quot;&gt;Sahel States vs. France&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defense pact appears as a definitive step following the deteriorating relations between these nations and France. Niger, especially, has expressed substantial concern over French involvement in the region and has compelled France to withdraw all forces from its territory, impacting the counterterrorism agreements profoundly. This development has sparked protests, with the local populace demanding the exit of French forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-alliance-matters&quot;&gt;Why the Alliance Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alliance is not just a military arrangement; it intertwines the economic and political futures of the involved nations and stresses the importance of political independence, human dignity, and economic emancipation for the African people and countries. The pact appears crucial for Mali, dealing with external military intervention fears and internal insurgencies, and offers Burkina Faso an opportunity to assume a leadership role, being relatively stable compared to its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-regional-turmoil&quot;&gt;Addressing Regional Turmoil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liptako-Gourma region, where the borders of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger converge, has been a hotspot for Islamist extremist violence for over a decade. This alliance seems to be a response to ongoing regional strife and is aimed at establishing a cohesive front against terrorism, symbolizing a united effort for regional stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-chapter-in-regional-dynamics&quot;&gt;A New Chapter in Regional Dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of the Alliance of Sahel States is a pivotal move that has the potential to reshape the geopolitical and security landscape of the Sahel region. It marks a departure from previous alignments and sets the stage for a new era of regional cooperation and conflict. Whether this alliance will prove to be a bastion of stability or a precursor to further tension remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly signals a new trajectory in the intricate tapestry of Sahel’s geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Amidst a backdrop of political upheavals and security concerns, the landlocked West African nations of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have announced the formation of the Alliance of Sahel States.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-chapter&quot;&gt;A New Chapter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 92, Murdoch reassured his colleagues through a letter that he remains in good health and his engagement with news and ideas will persist. His son, Lachlan Murdoch, is slated to take up the mantle as the sole chairman of both companies.

From taking control of News Limited in his mid-20s to establishing the internationally consolidated News Corporation in 1980, Murdoch’s impact has been both expansive and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murdoch’s innovations in media and his relentless pursuit of a diversified media empire, including television networks, newspapers, and magazines, have reshaped media consumption globally.

&lt;p&gt;Murdoch emphasized that his commitment to the cause of freedom of speech and thought would remain unswerving. He critiqued the contemptuous elites and some media entities, asserting that they have been pushing narratives rather than pursuing truth. In his newly announced role, he guaranteed his everyday involvement in the “contest of ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trident DMG’s connections to the Democratic Party are no secret in the corridors of power in Washington. And now, with reports suggesting their potential role in organizing opposition against Netanyahu on U.S. soil, these ties are receiving greater scrutiny.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-virtual-tug-of-war&quot;&gt;A Virtual Tug-of-War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, has found himself in hot water with the law. He has been slapped with charges, including making false statements during a firearm purchase and possessing a gun while being an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances. These accusations have come to the limelight amidst the broader controversies surrounding his past actions and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s legal team, led by attorney Abbe Lowell, sent out a request for the preliminary court appearance to be held virtually. However, this request isn’t sitting well with some, notably Special Counsel David Weiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-grounds-of-opposition&quot;&gt;The Grounds of Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weiss has made his stance clear by objecting to this request. His reasoning? The charges are of a “serious” nature, and it’s essential for the court to assess Hunter in person, especially when determining conditions of release. The emphasis here is on the gravity of the charges and the need for the court to make accurate evaluations without the limitations of a video call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counter-argument from Biden’s legal team is that they’re not asking for any special treatment. Lowell argues that Hunter is trying to minimize unnecessary strains on government resources, given the logistical challenges of a Secret Service-protected individual traveling cross-country and the subsequent disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-backstory&quot;&gt;The Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Hunter Biden’s activities have made the news. Fox News highlighted an incident from 2018 where a firearm owned by him was discarded in a trash bin near a school in Delaware. This event adds another layer of complexity to the current charges and the surrounding narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Hunter Biden’s past has been brought to light with his discharge from the Navy in 2014, following a positive cocaine test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-challenge-to-the-system&quot;&gt;A Challenge to the System?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbe Lowell is not backing down without a fight. He’s raised concerns over the nature of the charges and argues that they may be influenced by political pressure. Lowell believes that Hunter’s brief possession of an unloaded gun did not pose a public safety risk. In contrast, a prosecutor succumbing to political influences could threaten the justice system’s integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case progresses, many await to see how this chapter in Hunter Biden’s tumultuous life will conclude.

&lt;p&gt;During a candid chat with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, the 51-year-old “30 Seconds to Mars” frontman reminisced about his time in art school. Surrounded by artists, this environment nurtured both his creative passions and a penchant for drug experimentation. “I grew up in an environment where there were drugs around. I knew what the smell of weed is as a very, very young kid,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Leto matured, his curiosity grew. He spoke openly about being drawn to drugs and risk-taking, seeking novel experiences. However, this journey was not without its pitfalls. While honing his craft as a painter, he admitted to not just using drugs, but dealing them too. “My experience was certainly one that I took it for a ride and then it took me for a ride, for sure,” he reflected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, every dark tale has its turning point. For Leto, it was an “epiphany.” This moment of profound realization made him reconsider his life’s direction. Faced with two diverging paths, Leto chose one filled with aspirations and accomplishments he’d be proud of. Recalling close friends who didn’t make the same choice, Leto remarked somberly, “And they’re not here anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Leto has spoken out about his past. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, he delved into his experiences with drugs, sharing some light moments and the inevitable serious ones. “I guess at some point, too, there’s a decision: Is this going to be my life? I made a choice to pursue other dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not just about the choices made but the strength to change course when needed.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">56% of Virginians Say Drop Out - Gibson’s Tumultuous Campaign Journey</title><link href="/politics/2023/09/21/Gibson-Controversy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="56% of Virginians Say Drop Out - Gibson’s Tumultuous Campaign Journey" /><published>2023-09-21T14:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-21T14:12:00-04:00</updated><id>/politics/2023/09/21/Gibson-Controversy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/politics/2023/09/21/Gibson-Controversy/">&lt;p&gt;In an era where privacy lines blur and personal choices become political tools, Susanna Gibson, Virginia House of Delegates candidate for District 57, finds herself at the center of a public scandal that many argue she brought upon herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recently surfaced poll from Founders Insight Public Policy Institute, initially reported by the Daily Wire, reveals that a staggering 56% of likely Virginia voters believe Susanna Gibson should exit the political race. To make matters worse for Gibson, only 30% expressed that she should continue her campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-damaging-past-exposed&quot;&gt;A Damaging Past Exposed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibson’s fall from grace began with the revelation of her past indulgence in explicit online performances for monetary gains. As a 40-year-old nurse practitioner, wife to an attorney, and mother of two young boys, the explicit actions for which she once collected “tokens” or payments have now resurfaced to haunt her political aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to manage the fallout, Gibson posited herself as a victim of revenge porn. However, this stance was debunked swiftly, as several sources confirmed that the content in question was publicly produced and wasn’t “leaked” as she claimed. This has been particularly damaging, considering notable media outlets like the New York Times championed her “victim” narrative without verifying the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-questionable-response&quot;&gt;A Questionable Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that every individual has the right to their private choices. However, what is concerning to many is Gibson’s handling of the situation. Instead of addressing the issue head-on, she has essentially disappeared from the public eye, leaving many to speculate on her motivations and question her integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disappearing act might be a strategic move on Gibson’s part, waiting for the story to simmer down and for public attention to shift. However, this approach might be too optimistic, given that early voting starts this week and public sentiment is still largely against her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-matter-of-judgment&quot;&gt;A Matter of Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s reasonable to assert that everyone makes mistakes, especially in their youth, Gibson’s scenario is different. She wasn’t a naive teenager but a mature professional making choices that could impact her family’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of one’s past influencing their political career isn’t new. However, Gibson’s situation is particularly unique. It’s not just about her choices but also her seeming lack of foresight and responsibility, especially concerning her two young children. As the controversy continues to unfold, the looming question is whether Virginians can trust Gibson’s judgment in political matters when her personal decisions have been so questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, Gibson’s fate will unfold as Virginians decide if they can look past her questionable past and her recent behavior to support her bid for the House of Delegates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">In an era where privacy lines blur and personal choices become political tools, Susanna Gibson, Virginia House of Delegates candidate for District 57, finds herself at the center of a public scandal that many argue she brought upon herself.

But recently, it’s the growing number of tents and makeshift shelters that are stealing headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-the-golden-state-to-a-homeless-crisis&quot;&gt;From the Golden State to a Homeless Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic District Attorney Thien Ho of Sacramento County is up in arms against his city. Why? It’s over the homeless conditions which, according to him, resemble those of a “Third World country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Ho announced a civil lawsuit against Sacramento. The lawsuit accuses the city of allowing a public safety crisis concerning its homeless population. And the numbers back his claim: In just seven years, the unhoused population in Sacramento has skyrocketed by over 250%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our community is on the edge,” the lawsuit reads. “We have homeless folks living in conditions you’d find in severely underdeveloped countries. Meanwhile, the rest of us are caught between wanting to help and dealing with the chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tipping-point&quot;&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ho lamented the repetitive cycle the city seems to be stuck in. “It’s like Groundhog’s Day,” he said, “where the situation remains grim, and nothing improves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems stemming from the increasing homelessness are becoming hard to ignore. Both Judge Michael Bowman and District Attorney Ho have voiced concerns about growing homeless encampments near the courthouse. These settlements are not just an eyesore but also pose genuine threats. Reports include instances of assault, public misconduct, and other disturbances which, according to Ho, compromise the safety of jurors, victims, and witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plea-for-change&quot;&gt;A Plea for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s response to this escalating crisis has been, to many, unsatisfactory. Mayor Darrell Steinberg promised the initiation of the “Miller Park Safe Camping” to alleviate the situation, but three months on, conditions appear to have only deteriorated. Instances of assault and harassment linked to the homeless population have surged, further deepening the divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by Ho’s office in July asked locals how the 16 main homeless encampments across Sacramento affected their lives. Out of nearly 3,000 responses, many recounted harrowing experiences. Residents reported assaults, disruptions to community events, and continuous harassment by homeless individuals. Some even stated that their pleas for help from City Hall either went unanswered or were met with dismissive remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in response to the lawsuit, City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood expressed disappointment, stating the DA seems more keen on laying blame than seeking solutions. Mayor Steinberg termed Ho’s actions a “performative distraction,” yet acknowledged the frustrations faced by residents due to the ongoing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacramento’s struggle highlights the broader challenges many California cities face with their growing homeless populations. While solutions may be complex and multifaceted, the need for actionable change is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Sacramento, California’s capital, is often bustling with politicians and city leaders.

But it’s not a movie – it’s real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buzz around this surprising possibility grew louder after McConaughey shared some revelations about his family’s past. During a podcast interview, he disclosed that Harrelson’s father might have had a connection with his mother during her divorce. This set off waves of speculation – are the two superstar actors related by blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Maury Povich, a retired television host, best known for his dramatic on-screen DNA test reveals. In a light-hearted twist, Povich offered to step in and conduct a DNA test for the two stars, even proposing a prime-time TV special. “I would come out of retirement. We could do primetime, ‘DNA, Maury’s back with Woody and Matthew,’” Povich said in a video to E! News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrelson seemed intrigued by the idea when he appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” musing about the implications of such a test. “For [McConaughey], it’s a big deal. He feels like he’s losing a father. But I’m like, no, you’re gaining a different father and a brother.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two have been friends for over two decades, showcasing their camaraderie in projects such as “True Detective.” Fans are eagerly awaiting their reunion onscreen in the upcoming series, “Brother From Another Mother,” which, given the current rumors, holds an uncanny relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, will they take the test? The world waits with bated breath. Whatever the outcome, it’s clear that the bond between McConaughey and Harrelson is stronger than ever.

&lt;p&gt;Migrants, in search of a brighter future, have turned to trains as their way into Piedras Negras, Coahuila. This city shares its borders with Texas. From here, many hope to enter the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting their trip in the bustling industrial city of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, these determined individuals rode in and on the rail cars, moving towards their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things didn’t always go as planned. Mexican authorities caught wind of their journey and brought their train to a halt. Despite this hiccup, these migrants pressed on, eventually making their way to Piedras Negras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Piedras Negras? This city has become a significant spot for migrants. Nearly 4,000 migrants began their crossing into Texas just this past Wednesday. The city’s appeal? The area lacks the extensive border barriers and fencing seen in other regions, making it an attractive point of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
