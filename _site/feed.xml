A talent like hers, which spanned both on-screen and voice-over realms, is irreplaceable in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Christopher Lloyd, Sorkin’s husband and prominent figure behind “Modern Family” and “Frasier,” confirmed the sad news. The loss has left a void in the heart of Hollywood, and tributes are pouring in from across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gunn, the director known for his work on DC’s “The Suicide Squad,” expressed his condolences on Instagram, acknowledging Sorkin’s seminal contribution to the Harley Quinn character. “Rest in Peace, Arleen Sorkin, the incredibly talented original voice of Harley Quinn, who helped to create the character so many of us love. Love to her family and friends,” he penned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hamill, the voice of Joker and her co-star from “Batman: The Animated Series,” reminisced about his time working with Sorkin. Through his post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hamill highlighted not just Sorkin’s exemplary talent but her heartwarming personality. “Devastated to learn we’ve lost the brilliant Arleen Sorkin. Not just a wonderful talent, but a truly wonderful person,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Batman series, Sorkin’s voice brought Harley Quinn to life in a plethora of video games and animated series like “Justice League,” “Gotham Girls,” and “Batman: Arkham Asylum.” Harley Quinn’s prominence in the DC universe has only grown over the years, with Margot Robbie’s portrayal in movies like “Suicide Squad” and “Birds of Prey.” Kaley Cuoco and Tara Strong are among those who have since taken on the role in animated adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t just the world of animation that Arleen graced with her presence. She began her acting journey in the ’80s with roles in “Saturday Night Live” and “Trading Places,” eventually securing her memorable role in “Days of Our Lives” in 1984. The character Calliope Jones, known for her eccentricity and charm, earned Sorkin multiple awards and nominations. Her contribution to the soap opera spanned hundreds of episodes, with her final appearance in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorkin’s versatility was evident through her various roles, including her co-hosting stint on “America’s Funniest People” alongside Dave Coulier in the early ’90s. Her credits also extend to shows like “Duet,” “Open House,” and “Ted &amp;amp; Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world mourns the loss of such a multi-faceted talent. Arleen Sorkin is survived by her husband, Christopher Lloyd, and their two sons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gold Backed News</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Surge in Public Sector Jobs - 2023 Sees Massive Hiring Wave</title><link href="/news/2023/09/19/Public-Sector-Jobs-Boom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Surge in Public Sector Jobs - 2023 Sees Massive Hiring Wave" /><published>2023-09-19T15:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-19T15:04:00-04:00</updated><id>/news/2023/09/19/Public-Sector-Jobs-Boom</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2023/09/19/Public-Sector-Jobs-Boom/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Dawn for Public Sector Employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first eight months of 2023, there’s been a notable rise in public-sector job offerings. As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates an addition of 327,000 positions in the public sector. This impressive number represents almost 20% of all new jobs created this year, a significant leap from the mere 5% of total employment growth witnessed in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the Sudden Jump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that contributed to this growth. For one, the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 witnessed a similar hiring spree, when the U.S. government was on a hiring spree to address public safety concerns. Julia Pollak, an economist at the popular online job platform ZipRecruiter, made this insightful comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic saw a vast number of teachers, police officers, and other essential public workers stepping away from their roles. This left a massive void in the public sector, which is now being filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Border Patrol Ups Its Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear illustration of the public sector’s aggressive hiring approach can be seen in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s recent activities. They’ve strengthened their presence along the Mexico border. As part of their recruitment strategy, they’re offering attractive bonuses and other enticing incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of incentives, job postings on ZipRecruiter for government roles this year are showcasing salaries that are roughly 20% higher than what they were in 2022. This substantial bump in salary offerings is bound to make these roles more appealing to job seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Word of Caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this growth in the public sector is commendable, economists and HR leaders sound a word of caution. If the economy were to falter, resulting in budget deficits, the current momentum in public sector hiring could face significant challenges. Economic shortfalls could hinder governments’ ability to recruit for new positions in the future, making it imperative to monitor the situation closely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">A New Dawn for Public Sector Employment In the first eight months of 2023, there’s been a notable rise in public-sector job offerings.

Instead, he’s heading to Detroit, showing his support for the striking members of the United Auto Workers (UAW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Unwavering Support for the Working Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources, including Breitbart News and The New York Times, have confirmed Trump’s forthcoming appearance with UAW members, as they strike against automotive giants — General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. This bold move is seen as a counter to the GOP debate scheduled at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the union’s strike centers around higher wages amidst rising inflation and ensuring job security in President Joe Biden’s shifting vehicle agenda. Trump is slated to deliver a prime-time speech to current and former union members, highlighting these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strategic Move With A Broader Goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Trump has opted for such a strategy. Instead of attending the first GOP debate, he chose a one-on-one with Tucker Carlson, the host of the “Tucker on Twitter” show. This move generated significant attention, underscoring Trump’s distinctive style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe Trump’s approach is centered less on the GOP primaries and more on a potential general election rematch against President Biden. Historically, union workers, traditionally aligned with Democrats, played a crucial role in electing Trump in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Clear Message for the UAW and Biden’s Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump made his feelings clear about Biden’s electric vehicle strategy, suggesting it adversely affects UAW members. “AUTOWORKERS, VOTE FOR TRUMP – I’LL MAKE YOU VICTORIOUS &amp;amp; RICH,” Trump emphasized, urging workers to reconsider any allegiance to leaders who do not prioritize their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s message is clear: he stands firmly with the American working class. As the former President champions the cause of auto workers in Detroit, it becomes evident that his commitment to the everyday American remains undiminished.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">As the GOP candidates gear up for the second debate, Former President Donald Trump is once again pivoting away from the spotlight of party politics.

Already in the public eye for allegedly poisoning her husband with a lethal cocktail, she’s now accused of attempting to fabricate evidence by urging her brother to provide a false testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-twist-in-the-tale&quot;&gt;A Twist in the Tale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summit County officials stumbled upon a six-page letter in Richins’ jail cell that was addressed to her mother, Lisa Darden. Within the letter, Richins claims her attorney, Skye Lazaro, was seeking to establish a connection linking the drugs that poisoned her husband to Mexico. She then urged her brother, Ronald “Ronney” Darden, to provide testimony about Eric Richins’ supposed trips to Mexico to purchase painkillers and the lethal drug, fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an almost flippant tone, she wrote about the need to connect the drugs to Mexico, concluding with the statement “Upon information and belief LOL.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, prosecutors firmly state there is no existing connection between Eric Richins, Mexico, and the fatal fentanyl dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-motive-for-murder&quot;&gt;A Motive for Murder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that Kouri’s motive was financial gain. Records indicate she took out four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins, her husband, amounting to over $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On the first day of 2022, months before the tragic event, she changed the beneficiary of Eric’s $2 million life insurance policy to herself, without his consent. Notably, Eric had revised his will prior to his death, removing Kouri and naming his sister as the primary beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family members expressed concerns about Kouri’s intentions, recalling Eric’s fears for his life, especially after he believed she tried to poison him twice before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple’s relationship was also strained due to financial disagreements. Kouri had aspirations of purchasing and flipping a $2 million mansion for profit, while Eric viewed it as an overly costly venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disturbing-aftermath&quot;&gt;A Disturbing Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Eric’s untimely demise, Kouri penned a children’s book titled “Are You With Me?” dealing with the theme of death. Available for $14.99 on Amazon, the book claims to assist children in navigating the complexities of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the recent discoveries, it appears there’s much more to this case than meets the eye.

&lt;p&gt;Vice News recently brought to light accusations of sexual misconduct against Ballard, an anti-child trafficking activist. At the heart of the allegations are claims made by anonymous sources, indicating that at least seven women have voiced complaints against Ballard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;murky-details-amid-a-hit-movie&quot;&gt;Murky Details Amid a Hit Movie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women, believed to be central to these allegations, either haven’t responded to or have declined to comment on the Vice report. Ballard previously stepped down from his brainchild, Operation Underground Railroad, due to a separate investigation into similar misconduct claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rather startling detail, it was alleged that Ballard persuaded women to act as his “wife” during undercover missions abroad, which were directed at rescuing sex trafficking victims. Ballard allegedly pressured these women to share a bed or even shower together, under the pretext that it was essential to deceive the traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization, Operation Underground Railroad, acknowledged the allegations by stating they’ve employed an independent law firm to thoroughly investigate these claims. This inquiry remains underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;politics-and-podcasts&quot;&gt;Politics and Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these swirling allegations, there are whispers about Ballard’s political ambitions, suggesting he might be contemplating a run for the Utah U.S. Senate seat, potentially replacing Sen. Mitt Romney (R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballard’s political leanings are also garnering attention, given his alliance with former President Trump, even featuring him on his podcast. Recently, at a public gathering, Ballard seemed to refute the Vice News accusations, stating emphatically, “It’s not true, nothing you hear is true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more. An “anonymous letter” has allegedly been making rounds within Utah’s philanthropic circles over the past few months. This letter further accuses Ballard of sexual harassment, echoing some of Vice’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

The United States Marine Corps will now take charge of the ongoing investigation into this incident. The primary objective? To understand the circumstances leading to the “mishap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the safety of the local community, officials urge residents to steer clear of the area where the debris was found. With the incident currently under active investigation, further details remain scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s concerning, however, is the Marine Corps’ decision to halt operations temporarily. This two-day break will focus on discussing “aviation safety matters and best practices.” This comes on the back of three Class-A aviation “mishaps” occurring in the last six weeks. The pause will allow Marines to reevaluate and ensure proper flight procedures, maintenance standards, and overall combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

While MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi has labeled Meadows’ defense in the Georgia RICO case as “laughable,” it’s evident that the story is more nuanced than just the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meadows’ Defense: A Double-Edged Sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace emphasized the perception that Meadows is backed by strong legal counsel, suggesting that perhaps this sentiment has been blown out of proportion. Frank Figliuzzi weighed in, noting, “He does have a respected lawyer. The lesson is you can’t out-lawyer crime.” He indicated that Meadows’ efforts in the legal realm might encounter significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one can predict the outcome, Meadows, given his long-standing experience in politics, is likely well-aware of the ramifications and is probably strategizing with his legal team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexities in the Limelight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figliuzzi hinted at potential cooperation between Meadows and investigators, suggesting that Meadows might be in a difficult spot. And while this is pure speculation, such high-profile cases often come with a myriad of challenges. Meadows’ ability to navigate these will be under keen observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figliuzzi’s notion that time could see Meadows distancing himself from his allies is purely speculative, but such dynamics are not uncommon in high-stakes political situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Balanced Look at Mark Meadows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been a prominent figure in American politics, Mark Meadows has had his share of supporters and detractors. Current criticism notwithstanding, it’s crucial to approach his situation with a degree of objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As further details emerge, understanding the full scope of Meadows’ position and actions will be essential. He’s shown resilience in his political career, and this legal chapter will be another significant test of his mettle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The legal situation surrounding Mark Meadows, former Trump chief of staff, is rapidly evolving.

&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram clash, Hollywood actress Halle Berry voiced her disapproval when rapper Drake and singer SZA used a 2012 photograph of her to promote their fresh track “Slime You Out.” What’s the catch? They did it without asking her first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-slimy-situation&quot;&gt;The Slimy Situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial photo features Berry at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, where she is seen covered from head to toe in the iconic green slime. As it is customary at the Kids’ Choice Awards, celebrities often end up covered in this playful goop. But for Berry, the problem wasn’t the slime – it was its unexpected and unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, both Drake and SZA gave their fans a sneak peek of the song on their Instagram accounts, where they shared the slimed snapshot of Berry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry didn’t remain silent. On her own Instagram, she shared a mysterious message: “SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER GUY…EVEN IF YOU’RE A WOMAN!” Diving into the comments section, Berry further revealed her feelings, saying, “Didn’t get my permission,” and “That’s not cool I thought better of him!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further emphasized, “When people you admire disappoint you you have to be the bigger person and move on!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silence-from-the-stars&quot;&gt;The Silence from the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy, representatives for all three – Berry, Drake, and SZA – haven’t made any public statements addressing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song in the midst of this dispute, “Slime You Out,” was launched on September 15. Interestingly, the artwork for the song will also serve as the cover for Drake’s upcoming album, “For All The Dogs.” The rapper has also recently shared that his fans will have to wait a bit longer for his eighth studio album, now set to drop on October 6.&lt;/p&gt;

This incident underscores the complex challenges at the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-swift-verdict&quot;&gt;A Swift Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Posas Jr., 51, stood before U.S. District Judge Micaela Alvarez last week. The outcome? A hefty sentence of 162 months in prison followed by five years of closely watched release. This decision followed a brief trial held on June 27, where a jury took merely two hours to declare Posas guilty of plotting to traffic cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-incident&quot;&gt;The Incident&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 6, 2022, Posas met up with Alexis Soria Soria, a 25-year-old living unlawfully in the U.S., in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Weslaco, Texas. There, Soria handed over a box to Posas, which was later discovered to contain 20 kilograms of cocaine. The authorities also acquired recordings that captured the duo conversing about the drug deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Homeland Security Investigations had Posas under their radar for quite some time. They even managed to procure recorded phone calls, revealing Posas discussing drug deals for cash with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during his trial, Posas offered a surprising defense. He argued that he believed the box merely contained fruit, rather than the illicit drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-larger-picture&quot;&gt;The Larger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest and subsequent sentencing of a former CBP officer expose vulnerabilities and raise pressing questions about the integrity of those tasked with safeguarding the nation’s borders. The Rio Grande Valley remains a hotspot for both drug and human trafficking activities. Posas’ case stands as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against smuggling and the unexpected actors that can sometimes be found in its web.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Donna Teetree</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">In a stunning revelation, a former officer of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is sentenced to over a decade in prison for his involvement in a drug smuggling scheme.

But is this truly in the best interest of the American people and domestic energy production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shift from Energy Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located north of Albuquerque in Sandoval County, the affected area spans over 4,200 acres. If this proposal is greenlit, it will not only halt new mining claims and oil and gas development for up to five decades, but it also raises questions on the United States’ commitment to energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who previously pushed for similar actions while in Congress, defended the move. “Today we’re responding to calls from Tribes, elected leaders, and community members who want to see these public lands protected,” she commented. Haaland emphasized the importance of these lands for their cultural significance and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Cost of the Ban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the protection of natural habitats and historical sites is important, it’s equally crucial to consider the country’s energy needs and the potential economic implications of such bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the region possesses a high potential for sand and gravel extraction, which plays a pivotal role in infrastructure projects like roads. By sidelining these resources, not only does the country lose out on valuable domestic energy resources, but there’s also a significant economic blow. The Congressional Budget Office reported a projected decrease of $2 million in federal revenue due to this land withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as the Biden administration maneuvers to pivot the US away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, the tangible impact of these decisions on everyday Americans is profound. With restrictions on domestic energy production, the US could see increased dependence on foreign energy sources, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy security and higher costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Question of Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intent to preserve cultural resources and protect Native American lands is commendable, it’s essential to strike a balance. As we have seen from past actions, including the reversal of Trump-era decisions related to fossil fuel pipelines, the current administration’s approach tends to prioritize global climate ambitions over domestic energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of energy independence and the role of domestic resources in bolstering the US economy, it’s crucial to reassess the long-term implications of such bans. Finding a middle ground that caters to both environmental and energy concerns could be the way forward, ensuring a more stable future for the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Standard</name></author><category term="Politics" /><summary type="html">The Biden administration recently unleashed a proposal to impose a 50-year ban on mining and oil drilling across thousands of acres in New Mexico, citing protection of wildlife, cultural resources, and Native American lands as reasons.
