  <p>After more than three months of stalled productions and fervent negotiations, the stage is set for a return to normalcy in Hollywood. SAG-AFTRA, the union representing actors, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) have reached a tentative agreement, bringing an end to the historic 118-day strike that shook the core of the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>The agreement, which was reached with a unanimous vote, signals a new era of protections and pay raises for actors. With the ink set to dry at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, the entertainment industry breathes a collective sigh of relief. The union touted the deal as historic, particularly highlighting the first-ever protections against artificial intelligence that could impact actors’ livelihoods.</p>

<p>The resolution of the strike hinged on a pivotal and unanimous vote, with details of the agreement eagerly anticipated to be disclosed following a national board vote on Friday. Among the key victories for SAG-AFTRA members are the significant increases in minimums—up by 7%, which overshadows the increases secured by other industry guilds.</p>

<p>One of the most complex issues—artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize or disrupt the traditional ways of Hollywood—was among the last to be ironed out. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s chief negotiator, and Carol Lombardini, AMPTP’s CEO, engaged in critical discussions to finalize the terms that would eventually lead to the strike’s conclusion.</p>

<p>The Hollywood community, both on and offline, celebrated the end of the strike, which was felt by everyone from the most celebrated on-screen talents to the hardworking crews behind the scenes. The deal’s conclusion was not only a win for the actors but also signaled a positive shift for an industry grappling with technological advancements and new forms of content delivery.</p>

<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike’s conclusion is a testament to the power of collective bargaining and the resilience of union members. As the industry prepares to return to its bustling activity, the summer of 2024 looks brighter for both the creators and the audiences who cherish the magic of movies and television.</p>
