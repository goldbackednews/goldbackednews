  <p>From 19 to 15 years – that’s the new combined prison sentence for Todd and Julie Chrisley, the faces of reality show “Chrisley Knows Best.” Fox News Digital confirmed that the significant reduction in their sentences is thanks to their exemplary conduct behind bars.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the couple’s attorney, Jay Surgent, “Todd and Julie Chrisley have been model incarcerated individuals and have been compliant with all regulations promulgated by the bureau of prisons.”</p>

<p>Prior to the revision, Todd faced 12 years, while Julie was to serve seven after their 2019 indictment on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. This announcement comes just months after the pair’s entry into prison on January 17th.</p>

<p>However, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for the Chrisleys. Todd’s claims of prison mistreatment due to his celebrity status, and even reports of hazardous living conditions like mold, snakes, and temperature extremes have surfaced. Their children, Savannah and Chase Chrisley, expressed concerns over the “inhumane treatment” their parents faced, detailing the troubling conditions during an episode of the “Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley” podcast.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges and controversies surrounding the Chrisleys, their legacy in the entertainment world remains intact. Their breakthrough show, “Chrisley Knows Best,” may have signed off in March, but the Chrisley saga continues. A new reality show focusing on the lives of Todd and Julie’s children in the aftermath of their parents’ prison sentences is on the horizon.</p>

<p>Jay Surgent hints at the future show, stating, “It will be unscripted, and it will be a pivotal next chapter … for Chase, Savannah, Grayson, Chloe, and Nanny Faye,” potentially referring to an even more candid look into the Chrisley family.</p>

<p>As the family continues to evolve, fans and critics alike will be watching, eager to see what the next chapter brings for the Chrisleys.</p>
