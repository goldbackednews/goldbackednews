  <p>When it comes to the glamorous world of Hollywood, there’s always more than meets the eye. A recent revelation from Barbara Eden, the “I Dream of Jeannie” star, highlights one such behind-the-scenes tidbit involving none other than the king of rock ‘n’ roll, Elvis Presley.</p>

<h2 id="an-unexpected-counselor">An Unexpected Counselor</h2>

<p>During the filming of the 1960 movie “Flaming Star”, Presley found himself struggling with a personal dilemma. He was deeply in love with a young woman overseas and had concerns about bringing her to the limelight of Hollywood.</p>

<p>“[Elvis] told me about this girl he was very fond of,” Eden, who recently celebrated her 92nd birthday, shared. “He was curious about how my husband and I navigated the challenges of Hollywood as a couple.”</p>

<p>For those unaware, Eden was married to actor Michael Ansara at the time, and their relationship was thriving amidst the trials of Tinseltown.</p>

<p>“I advised him that as long as you see yourselves as a team, everything will work out,” Eden mentioned. Elvis, however, had his reservations, often echoing, “I just don’t know.” And who was this mysterious girl? The world soon came to know her as Priscilla Presley.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-a-king-but-a-gentleman">Not Just A King, But A Gentleman</h2>

<p>Though he was revered for his musical prowess and commanding stage presence, Presley left a lasting impression on Eden as a kind-hearted and well-mannered gentleman. She reminisced about his courteous gestures, such as pulling out a chair for her – a rarity in the world of acting.</p>

<p>With a chuckle, Eden recalled, “He’d bring along his father and another man, whom he referred to as his ‘cousin’. They’d just sit together, strumming their guitars and singing.”</p>

<p>When it came to the topic of Priscilla, Presley had met the young beauty while stationed in Germany with the Army. The age difference and circumstances raised eyebrows, but their love story became a topic of much discussion and admiration.</p>

<h2 id="a-legacy-beyond-jeannies-bottle">A Legacy Beyond Jeannie’s Bottle</h2>

<p>While Presley’s and Eden’s paths crossed briefly, Eden’s own journey in Hollywood was nothing short of legendary. Her iconic role as the whimsical and loveable genie propelled her to stardom. However, her casting was anything but conventional.</p>

<p>“I never imagined they’d cast a short blonde like me for the role,” Eden laughed. But after a simple tea meeting with the show creator, Sidney Sheldon, the rest became history.</p>

<p>While her character and the show itself were groundbreaking, Eden revealed that the most buzzed-about topic was her concealed navel! NBC executives were insistent on keeping her midriff modestly hidden, sparking endless speculation and intrigue among fans and the media.</p>

<h2 id="a-life-well-lived">A Life Well Lived</h2>

<p>Now, Eden remains active and is looking forward to her appearances at upcoming conventions and the release of her new children’s book. Her secret to staying fit? A rigorous routine involving cycling and weightlifting.</p>

<p>She concludes with a smile, “I’m blessed with a wonderful family and amazing fans. ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ was a joyful journey, and I’m grateful for every moment of it.”</p>

<p>A heartwarming tale of two iconic figures, this revelation about Presley and Eden’s relationship provides a deeper look into the human side of Hollywood’s glitz and glamour.</p>
