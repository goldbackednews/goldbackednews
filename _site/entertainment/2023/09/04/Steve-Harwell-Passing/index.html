  <p>LOS ANGELES - The world of rock mourns the loss of a stalwart as Steve Harwell, the spirited lead singer of Grammy-nominated pop rock ensemble, Smash Mouth, departs at the age of 56.</p>

<p>Robert Hayes, the band’s manager, conveyed the sad news stating that Harwell’s demise came in a peaceful manner, surrounded by close family and friends in his Boise, Idaho residence. The untimely death was due to acute liver failure.</p>

<p>Smash Mouth, best known for chartbusters such as “All Star” and “Then the morning comes,” rose to prominence under Harwell’s dynamic leadership.</p>

<p>Hayes reminisced about Harwell’s impact, stating, “Steve Harwell was a true American Original. A larger than life character… Steve should be remembered for his unwavering focus and impassioned determination to reach the heights of pop stardom.”</p>

<p>Hailing from California, Harwell began his music journey with rap ensemble F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech) before founding Smash Mouth in 1994. The band’s monumental success was marked by platinum records such as 1997’s “Fush Yu Mang” and 1999’s “Astro Lounge.” The latter encapsulated gems like the Grammy-nominated “All Star,” immortalized further by its appearance in the film “Shrek.”</p>

<p>Harwell’s unique voice was not the only thing that set him apart; his spirited personality played a pivotal role in Smash Mouth’s rise. He possessed an unerring sense of humor that manifested both in the band’s music and his 2001 comedy cameo in “Rat Race.” Off-stage, he enjoyed a close camaraderie with renowned chef and host, Guy Fieri.</p>

<p>“His only tools were his irrepressible charm and charisma… Steve lived a 100% full-throttle life. Burning brightly across the universe before burning out,” expressed Hayes.</p>

<p>Despite his departure from Smash Mouth in 2021 due to health challenges, Harwell’s presence left an indelible mark. Harwell had been battling cardiomyopathy for nearly a decade, facing a series of medical complications.</p>

<p>Harwell’s final days were marked by the comfort of hospice care. His mortal remains will find solace in San Jose, California, next to his beloved mother.</p>

<p>The void left by his departure is profound, but his legacy will resonate in the melodies he left behind.</p>
