  <p>Mohamed Al-Fayed, a name synonymous with luxury businesses and a significant figure in the controversy surrounding Princess Diana’s tragic death, has passed away at age 94. The announcement of his passing comes a day after the 26th anniversary of the tragic car crash in Paris that claimed the lives of his son Dodi and Princess Diana.</p>

<h2 id="an-illustrious-legacy">An Illustrious Legacy</h2>

<p>Born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1929, Al-Fayed moved to the U.K. in the 1960s and built a sprawling business empire. Among his notable possessions were the iconic Harrods department store in London and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, the latter being the location where Diana and Dodi dined before their ill-fated drive.</p>

<p>Besides his ventures in luxury retail, Al-Fayed also had affiliations with Fulham Football Club. “On behalf of everyone at Fulham Football Club, I send my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mohamed Al Fayed,” expressed Shahid Khan, his successor as owner of the club, emphasizing Al-Fayed’s legacy at Fulham.</p>

<h2 id="personal-investigations-and-allegations">Personal Investigations and Allegations</h2>

<p>The Egyptian billionaire’s life took a sharp turn on the night of August 31, 1997. The accident that caused the demise of his son and Princess Diana became a focal point of his life. Struggling with the personal loss, Al-Fayed launched his private investigations, positing that the crash was not accidental but rather a conspiracy. His explosive claims included allegations that the British royal family was involved in orchestrating the deaths to “get rid” of Diana.</p>

<p>However, the official British and French investigations contradicted Al-Fayed’s claims, concluding that the accident was caused by the car’s driver who was intoxicated and speeding.</p>

<h2 id="dianas-final-moments-and-speculations">Diana’s Final Moments and Speculations</h2>

<p>The summer leading to the tragic event saw Diana enjoying a vacation on the yacht named the Jonikal. Sansum, her former bodyguard, recalled a particular instance when Diana was deeply distraught after hearing about Versace’s death. She questioned her safety, hinting at fears about potential threats to her life. Despite the peril posed by paparazzi, who constantly sought photos of Diana, her security did their utmost to ensure her privacy and safety.</p>

<p>Sansum also shared Diana’s thoughts on relocating to the U.S., where she felt more loved and safer. Although she desired to move, she acknowledged that her sons, Princes William and Harry, would remain in the U.K.</p>

<p>Mohamed Al-Fayed’s life, marked by immense success and grave controversies, has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on many. As the world mourns his passing, discussions around the events that dominated his later life will likely resurface. However, beyond the shadows of conspiracy theories and speculation, stands a man who built an empire, faced unimaginable personal loss, and remained a significant figure in the global spotlight until his final days.</p>
