  <p>The talented actor and singer, Jared Leto, recently peeled back the curtain on a darker chapter in his life, revealing that he was once “a professional drug user.”</p>

<p>During a candid chat with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, the 51-year-old “30 Seconds to Mars” frontman reminisced about his time in art school. Surrounded by artists, this environment nurtured both his creative passions and a penchant for drug experimentation. “I grew up in an environment where there were drugs around. I knew what the smell of weed is as a very, very young kid,” he shared.</p>

<p>As Leto matured, his curiosity grew. He spoke openly about being drawn to drugs and risk-taking, seeking novel experiences. However, this journey was not without its pitfalls. While honing his craft as a painter, he admitted to not just using drugs, but dealing them too. “My experience was certainly one that I took it for a ride and then it took me for a ride, for sure,” he reflected.</p>

<p>Yet, every dark tale has its turning point. For Leto, it was an “epiphany.” This moment of profound realization made him reconsider his life’s direction. Faced with two diverging paths, Leto chose one filled with aspirations and accomplishments he’d be proud of. Recalling close friends who didn’t make the same choice, Leto remarked somberly, “And they’re not here anymore.”</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time Leto has spoken out about his past. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, he delved into his experiences with drugs, sharing some light moments and the inevitable serious ones. “I guess at some point, too, there’s a decision: Is this going to be my life? I made a choice to pursue other dreams.”</p>

<p>Leto’s candid revelations serve as a potent reminder of the challenges many face and the resilience required to overcome them. It’s not just about the choices made but the strength to change course when needed.</p>
