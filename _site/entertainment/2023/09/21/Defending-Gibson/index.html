  <p>Amidst a wave of mixed reactions, Albert Hughes, the director of the new TV series “The Continental: From the World of John Wick”, is defending his choice to cast Mel Gibson. The series, a prequel to the successful “John Wick” films, features Gibson in the role of Cormac, the manager of the New York Continental.</p>

<h3 id="why-gibson">Why Gibson?</h3>

<p>“I cast [Gibson] based on his past work that I grew up on,” Hughes said in a recent interview with the New York Post. He believes that fans will understand the casting decision once they see Gibson’s performance. “The personal stuff is not my business to talk about,” Hughes emphasized.</p>

<p>However, not everyone is thrilled about the casting. Social media has been buzzing with reactions from fans, many of whom have strong opinions on Gibson due to his past controversies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“john wick without keanu (and with mel gibson) is not john wick at all,” shared one user on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another added, “I can’t stomach watching Mel Gibson ever again.”</p>

<p>But Hughes isn’t fazed by the social media chatter. He explained that the casting process in Hollywood often involves narrowing down from a list of big names, based on availability and response from agents.</p>

<h3 id="a-controversial-past">A Controversial Past</h3>

<p>Gibson has been a contentious figure in Hollywood since his 2006 arrest for DUI. The incident became even more controversial due to Gibson’s antisemitic remarks during the arrest. Tapes from 2010 further tarnished his image, showcasing Gibson using racist language towards his then-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva.</p>

<p>However, the actor-director has since apologized, particularly for the antisemitic comments, saying, “There is no excuse, nor should there be any tolerance, for anyone who thinks or expresses any kind of antisemitic remark.”</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

<p>Chad Stahelski, the director behind the “John Wick” films, serves as the executive producer for the new series. Though the show shares a universe with the films, Hughes assures fans that it offers a different perspective.</p>

<p>Gibson’s presence in the series will undoubtedly continue to be a topic of debate among fans. But as the premiere date draws near, it remains to be seen whether the actor’s involvement will affect the show’s success.</p>
