  <p>In a hard-hitting speech delivered to the South Dakota GOP convention, former President Donald Trump voiced concerns over the resurgence of “COVID hysteria.” A believer in political maneuvering, Trump suggested the return of heightened pandemic precautions may be linked to the upcoming elections, urging Republicans to be vigilant against potential overreaches.</p>

<p>Addressing a rapt audience and broadcast live on Newsmax, Trump stated, <em>“Congressional Republicans should also stop the Biden administration from bringing back COVID mandates, lockdowns, and restrictions of any kind, cutting off the money.”</em></p>

<p>South Dakota, under the leadership of GOP Gov. Kristi Noem, stands strong against such restrictions, a fact not lost on Trump. The former president lauded Noem’s approach, highlighting the freedoms enjoyed by South Dakotans compared to residents in other states. Gov. Noem’s endorsement of Trump the same evening has further ignited speculations about her possible vice-presidential candidacy alongside Trump in 2024.</p>

<p>Looking back at the 2020 presidential election, Trump remained consistent in his criticism, maintaining that Democrats “used COVID to cheat,” particularly focusing on the sudden adoption of mass mail-in balloting in pivotal states without the necessary constitutional authorization from their respective state legislatures.</p>

<p>Continuing his critique, Trump didn’t mince words as he said, <em>“The radical Democrats are trying hard to restart COVID hysteria. I wonder why? Is there an election coming up by any chance?”</em> His statement was underlined by his observation that talk of masks has resurfaced, drawing a line of connection between COVID precautions and the upcoming electoral showdown.</p>

<p>Trump’s warning is a call to action for Republicans. As America gears up for another critical electoral season, the interplay between pandemic management and political strategy remains a topic that will be fervently discussed and dissected in the months to come.</p>
