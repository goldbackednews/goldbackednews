  <p>Country music’s rising star, Oliver Anthony, recently made waves not only for his music but also for taking a firm stance on affordable concert ticket prices. He cancelled an upcoming performance in Knoxville, Tennessee, in response to the venue’s alleged sharp ticket price increase.</p>

<p>Last month, Anthony was catapulted into the spotlight after his politically-infused track, “Rich Men North of Richmond,” became an internet sensation.</p>

<p>Addressing the issue, Anthony voiced his disappointment on Facebook, explaining his intentions for keeping his shows budget-friendly. “These are supposed to be affordable shows,” he emphasized, adding, “It’s also horses— that they’re charging extra for VIP meet and greet. Those are supposed to be free.”</p>

<p>In an age of exorbitant concert ticket prices, Anthony’s commitment to affordability is refreshing. Moreover, he shed light on allegations made by the venue, Cotton Eyed Joe, which claimed Anthony was demanding $120,000 for his performance.</p>

<p>Setting the record straight, the singer detailed, “The most I’ve ever made on a show is $35,000. We’ve done two shows in NC that were completely free, and have another free show scheduled September 23rd in Kentucky for a cancer benefit.”</p>

<p>While Anthony expressed his frustrations with the venue’s alleged misleading claims, he also acknowledged his responsibility in the matter. “All the fault ultimately is with me. I should have been more thoroughly involved in the booking, and I should probably consider using a professional consultant in this area,” he admitted.</p>

<p>But fans of the country sensation need not be dismayed. Oliver Anthony has already arranged an alternate venue for his performance in Knoxville. He recently announced a new concert date at the Knoxville Convention Center on September 29, promising an affordable and fun-filled evening for his supporters.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that artists prioritize their fans over potential earnings, and Oliver Anthony’s actions are a testament to his dedication to his fanbase. His genuine concern and proactive response are sure to earn him even more respect and loyalty in the country music community.</p>
