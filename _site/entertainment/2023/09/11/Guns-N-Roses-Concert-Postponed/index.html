  <p>In an unforeseen twist, rock legends Guns N’ Roses have postponed their highly-anticipated St. Louis concert scheduled for September 9 due to a reported illness.</p>

<p><strong>Unplugged Due to Illness</strong></p>

<p>In an official statement shared on their Instagram, the band relayed the unfortunate news, “Gunners, the concert in St. Louis on September 9 stands postponed due to illness. Please hold on to your tickets. Those unable to attend the rescheduled date will receive refunds.”</p>

<p>The band rounded off their announcement by expressing gratitude for the continued support from their fans, symbolized with a rose emoji.</p>

<p><strong>Unwavering Fan Support</strong></p>

<p>Despite the unexpected setback, the band’s loyal followers, known endearingly as “Gunners,” flooded the Instagram announcement with messages of goodwill and concern. Comments ranged from fans recalling the band’s memorable New Jersey show to general well wishes, emphasizing health as a priority.</p>

<p>While the specific member affected by the illness remains unclear, the band’s iconic frontman, Axl Rose, hinted at health issues earlier in the week. Taking to X, previously known as Twitter, he remarked that he felt “a little horse,” accompanying his statement with a playful picture of a small horse, adding, “Fun night, Great Crowd!! Great Venue!! N’ great to be back!!”</p>

<p><strong>On the Road Again</strong></p>

<p>The legendary hard rock ensemble began their ambitious Guns N’ Roses World Tour 2023 in Tel Aviv, Israel, this June. After electrifying performances spanning Europe, including shows in countries like Spain, Denmark, Germany, and the U.K., the group commenced their North American leg in August, with a stopover in Moncton, Canada.</p>

<p>With the St. Louis concert temporarily on hold, fans eagerly await the band’s next scheduled performance at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville on September 12.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, the current lineup of the iconic group comprises Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Dizzy Reed, Richard Fortus, Frank Ferrer, and Melissa Reese.</p>

<p>For the “Gunners” out there, remember to stay updated on the band’s official channels for the rescheduled concert date.</p>
