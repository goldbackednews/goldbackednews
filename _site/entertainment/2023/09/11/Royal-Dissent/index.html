  <p>The tides of popularity have dramatically shifted for Prince Harry in the UK. Recent findings from a Deltapoll conducted for the Daily Mail reveal that an overwhelming 61% of Britons believe that Prince Harry should be excluded from the line to the throne.</p>

<p>Prince Harry, once a widely cherished member of the British Royal Family, saw a precipitous drop in his public standing following his marriage to American actress Meghan Markle. Although Harry stepped away from his royal duties to pursue roles in entertainment and activism, he currently stands fifth in the royal line of succession. This sequence places him behind his elder brother Prince William and William’s children, Prince George, Prince Louis, and Princess Charlotte.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Meghan doesn’t hold a position in the line of succession, similar to her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales. However, Meghan’s children with Harry, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, are presently sixth and seventh in line for the throne.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan’s reputation has experienced a considerable decline in the UK over recent years. The couple, often described as ‘woke’, have openly expressed their challenges within the Royal Family, making serious accusations, including claims of racism. Such accusations have reportedly strained relations between Prince Harry, King Charles III, and Prince William. Reports even suggested that the couple’s sharp criticisms deeply upset the late Queen Elizabeth II, particularly in the twilight of her life, battling bone marrow cancer.</p>

<p>In line with the consensus against Harry’s place in the royal line, the dominant view among the British populace is that Harry and Meghan should not benefit from public funding. This sentiment emerges despite the couple’s reported earnings of around £100 million from media deals since their 2020 move to the United States. Notwithstanding their substantial earnings, Meghan and Harry have sought taxpayer-funded police protection during their visits to the UK.</p>
