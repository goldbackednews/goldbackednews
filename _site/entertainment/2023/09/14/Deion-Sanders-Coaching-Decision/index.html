  <p>Launching the Colorado Buffaloes to a promising 2-0 start this season, Deion Sanders appears to have bigger fish to fry than the glitz and glamour of the NFL.</p>

<p>After his transition from Jackson State, an FCS school, to Colorado in December, Sanders swiftly became a household name in the coaching realm. His leadership has ushered the Buffaloes to national prominence, with both “Big Noon Kickoff” and “College Gameday” gearing up to cover their imminent clash against Colorado State.</p>

<p>Yet, with growing acclaim come rumors. Many speculated if Sanders would soon take his talent to the NFL sidelines. Joel Klatt, in a recent segment, laid such speculations to rest. “He’s not going to the NFL,” Klatt affirmed. Sharing insights from a conversation with Sanders, Klatt conveyed, “Deion doesn’t want to coach in the NFL. He sees his role as more of a mentor.”</p>

<p>Sanders’ passion lies in shaping young athletes during the pivotal years of college. Klatt highlighted Sanders’ perspective, stating he “believes this is his ministry. To be present for these college kids.”</p>

<p>Sanders doesn’t just impress on the coaching front. His adeptness as a recruiter is evident. Under the moniker “Coach Prime”, Sanders succeeded in bringing Travis Hunter, 2022’s top recruit, from Jackson State to Colorado. And whispers have it that Bryce Underwood, pegged as the premier quarterback recruit for 2025, has Colorado on his radar, thanks to reports.</p>

<p>Addressing his recruitment philosophy, Sanders opined, “Obviously, when you have a coach that played defensive back, you attract skill positions.” He went on to hint at the barrage of inquiries they receive from budding players keen on joining the Colorado ranks, showcasing the burgeoning interest and trust in his leadership.</p>

<p>For the foreseeable future, it’s clear: Sanders is on a mission to redefine college football, leaving the NFL’s allure in the rearview.</p>
