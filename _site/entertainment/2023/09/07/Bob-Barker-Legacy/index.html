  <p>Bob Barker, whose name became synonymous with daytime TV and the ever-entertaining “The Price is Right,” passed away last month. Reports now reveal that the charismatic TV personality had been silently grappling with Alzheimer’s Disease for years.</p>

<p>According to a death certificate accessed by PEOPLE, Barker’s demise at the venerable age of 99 came after a prolonged battle with this neurodegenerative disorder. The certificate didn’t specify the exact time of diagnosis but confirmed that the beloved game show host had been living with Alzheimer’s Disease for “years.”</p>

<p>In addition to Alzheimer’s, other health challenges faced by Barker in his later years included hypertension (high blood pressure), hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). These were listed as “other significant conditions” that may have contributed to his passing.</p>

<p>Barker’s influence on American television is undeniable. From 1972 to 2007, his daily presence on CBS’s “The Price is Right” was a comforting ritual for countless fans, spanning generations. His signature charm and affable demeanor made him a favorite among both housewives and young ones spending a sick day away from school.</p>

<p>While Barker’s professional life was filled with accolades and fan adoration, his personal life saw its share of sorrow. His wife, Dorothy Jo, passed away in 1981. The couple had no children, and Barker chose not to remarry, dedicating his later years to various philanthropic efforts.</p>

<p>As the entertainment industry mourns the loss of one of its brightest stars, Bob Barker’s legacy as a television icon remains indelible. His contribution to the world of entertainment, coupled with the strength he displayed in his personal battles, will be remembered for years to come.</p>
