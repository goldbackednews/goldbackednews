  <p>For fans of the legendary horror film “Halloween,” a unique opportunity has arisen. The infamous Pasadena home that served as the backdrop for Laurie Strode’s (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) nightmarish encounters with the relentless Michael Meyers is now listed for sale.</p>

<p>This iconic property, which provided the setting for the chilling events of Haddonfield, Illinois, in the 1978 movie, has remained with one family for three generations. Now, according to the New York Daily News, it awaits a new owner with a listed price of $1.799 million.</p>

<p>The realtor’s description emphasizes the home’s cinematic significance, drawing attention to its familiar stoop: “If you watch the film, you’ll recognize the infamous stoop that Jamie Lee Curtis sat on, holding a pumpkin.” But beyond its filmic connections, the house has undergone transformations over the years. Originally portrayed as a single-family residence, it has since been subdivided into three separate units.</p>

<p>The property also boasts a historic fruit-bearing avocado tree, a remnant from the 1940s, planted by the sellers’ grandfather. This detail provides a touch of nostalgia to the otherwise eerie history of the home.</p>

<p>Jamie Lee Curtis, now 64, has an intimate bond with the Halloween series, crediting it with many positive turns in her life. Reflecting on her connection to Laurie, she told People magazine, “everything good in my life can be traced back to Laurie.” Curtis even recalls spotting her now-husband of 37 years, Christopher Guest, in a 1984 Rolling Stone article while she was with Debra Hill, the writer of the original Halloween. “Life is scary. But Laurie taught me that life can also be beautiful, filled with love and art and life!” Curtis expressed, cherishing her role’s impact on her personal and professional journey.</p>

<p>The so-called “murder house” wasn’t only featured in the original film. It made a return in the 2021 sequel, “Halloween Kills,” where a harrowing scene involving firefighters unfolds.</p>

<p>Realtor Heidi Babcock captures the allure of this unique listing, stating, “This exceptional property is a wonderful place to live, work, and play in one of the most desirable communities in greater LA.”</p>

<p>For horror aficionados or fans of cinematic history, this property presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Who will be the next to claim this piece of Hollywood horror legacy?</p>
