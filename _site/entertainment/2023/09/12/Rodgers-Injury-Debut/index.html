  <p>Monday night’s highly awaited game between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills saw an unexpected turn as Aaron Rodgers, the newly acquired Jets quarterback, had to exit early. After being on the field for only a few minutes into his debut with the Jets, Rodgers suffered an ankle injury, putting a damper on the night for Jets fans.</p>

<p>The injury occurred when Buffalo Bills linebacker Leonard Floyd managed to sack Rodgers. Although Rodgers initially attempted to brush off the setback, he soon needed assistance to leave the field. This was a sight no sports fan ever wishes to see – a prominent player being escorted off the field, especially during a debut.</p>

<p>Subsequent broadcasts from ESPN showed Rodgers, with evident difficulty, making his way onto a cart that transported him towards the stadium’s tunnel. He was then spotted limping towards the locker room, and later, with a protective boot on his injured ankle. Before this unfortunate turn of events, Rodgers had yet to complete a pass, with a record of 0-for-1.</p>

<p>With Rodgers out of the picture, the Jets had to rely on Zach Wilson, their former starting quarterback. Wilson, who started for the Jets during his first two seasons, was supposed to be the backup to Rodgers after losing his primary spot towards the end of 2022.</p>

<p>For Rodgers, this game was meant to be an exhilarating first with the Jets, having recently showcased his prowess in a preseason match against the New York Giants where he threw an impressive touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson. Pre-game, he had spoken about the “butterflies” he felt during that preseason match.</p>

<p>In a light-hearted moment before the game, when asked about his feelings on stepping onto the field for his Jets’ debut, Rodgers had humorously remarked that he’d probably be “sobbing.” He had further added that he looked forward to the experience and the energy of the crowd.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Rodgers and the Jets, the night didn’t go as planned. The extent of Rodgers’ injury remains to be seen, and fans across the nation are hoping for a swift recovery for the renowned quarterback.</p>
