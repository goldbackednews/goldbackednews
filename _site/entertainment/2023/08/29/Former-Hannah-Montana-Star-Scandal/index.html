  <p>In a surprise turn of events for Disney Channel enthusiasts, Mitchel Musso, renowned for his portrayal of Oliver Oken in the popular series ‘Hannah Montana,’ finds himself once again under the scrutiny of the law.</p>

<p>The Saturday evening of August 12th in Rockwall, Texas, witnessed Musso’s arrest, not far from the city lights of Dallas. The root cause? Reportedly, entering a hotel seemingly under the influence. As per eyewitness accounts and later confirmed by the police, the actor impulsively grabbed a bag of chips, began munching on them, and then, without any intention of payment, got into a verbal altercation when confronted.</p>

<p>However, the charges didn’t stop at theft and public intoxication. Upon his arrest outside the hotel, police officers discerned clear signs of intoxication. Further investigation unearthed several outstanding traffic warrants linked to the Rockwall Police Department. As a result, Musso was promptly moved to the Rockwall County Detention Center.</p>

<p>Following a night behind bars, the actor was released late Sunday afternoon after posting a $1,000 bond.</p>

<p>This isn’t Musso’s maiden voyage into the realm of legal troubles. Flashback to 2011, a 20-year-old Musso was apprehended on DUI charges in Burbank, California. As reports highlighted back then, Musso didn’t decelerate at an intersection, despite clear instructions from traffic police officers. Subsequent investigations confirmed the actor’s blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit, especially damning considering his age.</p>

<p>The question now remains - how will these recent charges impact the former Disney star’s career and public image? While time will tell, fans and critics alike await Musso’s response to this latest chapter in his tumultuous journey.</p>
