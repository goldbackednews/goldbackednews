  <p>In an era where our online identities sometimes speak louder than our real lives, a digital hack can be devastating. For former ‘Bachelorette’ contestant, Josh Seiter, this became a nightmarish reality when hackers took over his Instagram account, leading many to believe the worst - that he had passed away.</p>

<p>The internet was in a frenzy when on Monday, a post from Seiter’s account announced his “unexpected passing.” Understandably, fans were in shock and disbelief, pouring out their grief and condolences. But soon after, a determined Seiter regained control of his account, ensuring his fans and followers that he was, in fact, “alive and well.”</p>

<p>In a heartfelt video shared on his Instagram, Seiter revealed, “Somebody was playing a cruel joke and mocking my mental illness and the struggles I’ve gone through with depression and suicide attempts.” Expressing deep regret for the anguish caused by the ill-intentioned post, he vowed to work with his team to find the culprits behind this digital crime.</p>

<p>While representatives for Meta, the company owning Instagram, have yet to comment, Seiter’s ordeal sheds light on the darker side of our internet-driven society. It’s a stark reminder of how intertwined our lives have become with our online personas, and how easily the narrative can be changed, causing immeasurable distress.</p>

<p>Beyond the hacking incident, Seiter’s transparency about his mental health struggles over the years showcases a resilience that is both humbling and inspiring. In previous posts, he opened up about his journey, from being committed to a psychiatric ward at 21 and surviving an attempted suicide at 22, to graduating top of his class from law school at 25 and becoming a prominent mental health advocate.</p>

<p>Seiter’s message to fans is clear: “Never, ever give up. Your story isn’t written yet. Every chapter is leading to a more perfect ending. I promise.” As he moves forward from this incident, the former reality star’s tale of triumph over adversity continues to inspire and remind us all of the strength of the human spirit.</p>
