  <p>Meghan Markle, previously adored for her role in the popular TV show “Suits”, now faces the challenges of reshaping her career, post royal responsibilities. As Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, leans more towards charitable work after their royal exit, Meghan seems to be taking a new direction in her career.</p>

<p>This distinction in their career paths was highlighted when talent agency WME announced that they were only representing Meghan. Subsequent news revealed that Prince Harry was the executive producer of ‘Heart of Invictus’, a venture Meghan wasn’t involved in. This has stirred debates among royal experts, suggesting Meghan’s inclination towards resuming her acting career and setting herself apart from the royal sphere.</p>

<p>Meghan’s journey began with her prominent role in “Suits”. However, she gave up her role in 2016 as her relationship with Prince Harry deepened. Her recent signing with the high-profile agency WME was reportedly to explore avenues in film and television production, brand partnerships, and “overall business-building.” Interestingly, acting was explicitly mentioned not to be her primary focus.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing, though. “Pearl”, an animated series under Meghan’s Archewell Productions label, was dropped by Netflix during its development phase. Following that, the “Archetypes” podcast, which Meghan and Harry produced together, was also discontinued.</p>

<p>However, there might be a silver lining for Meghan’s career. In tandem with Prince Harry, Meghan has secured film rights to a romance novel, “Meet Me at the Lake”, hinting at a potential Netflix production that may resonate with their personal love story.</p>

<p>Kinsey Schofield of the “To Di for Daily” podcast commented on the matter, suggesting that the general public’s acceptance of Meghan was primarily due to their admiration for Prince Harry. Schofield believes that while Meghan might pursue the limelight, Harry’s commitment to charity could earn him more appreciation.</p>

<p>Branding expert Doug Eldridge opined that Meghan’s recent career endeavors might not have been as successful as expected. Yet, with strong PR strategies, she could still pique interest among various media brands and studio executives.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Meghan’s fame skyrocketed after “Suits” achieved record-breaking streams on platforms like Netflix. This feat, combined with the couple’s exclusive multiyear production deal with Netflix, suggests that Meghan’s future in the entertainment industry is still promising.</p>

<p>Schofield encapsulated the sentiment by saying that the duo’s philanthropic work could have led to a different narrative for them post their royal departure. Whether Meghan’s rebranding decision will stand in her favor remains to be seen, but it’s clear that the Sussexes continue to capture the public’s attention, each in their unique way.</p>
