  <p>Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, admired by many for her taste in decor, culinary expertise, and recent Sports Illustrated feature, now faces an avalanche of backlash. The bone of contention? A cocktail chilled with an “iceberg.”</p>

<p>During a luxurious Arctic cruise from Iceland to Greenland, Martha shared a social media snapshot, gleefully sipping her drink. Her caption, “We actually captured a small iceberg for our cocktails tonight,” was where the chill began for her followers.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for celebrities to celebrate with lavish and sometimes unique experiences, but in this era of environmental consciousness, many felt Stewart’s icy stunt was tone-deaf to the ongoing climate crisis. The shared images, one of a chunk of ice on a cart, and others depicting the serene glaciers, inadvertently shed light on the fragility of the Arctic ecosystem.</p>

<p>Comments ranged from concerns about the melting ice caps to direct calls out on Martha’s perceived insensitivity. “I generally love Martha and the excesses of her life,” shared one user, “but wealthy white people drinking their iceberg cocktails while the planet is in flames is a bit tone deaf.” The irony wasn’t lost on another commenter who remembered Martha’s recent climate change mention about a washout on her New York driveway.</p>

<p>However, the backlash wasn’t limited to the climate alone. Some followers raised eyebrows over the purity of the supposed iceberg ice. The idea of potentially drinking ancient contaminants or, humorously put by one, “a side of ancient ice worm martinis” was less than appealing to many.</p>

<p>Representatives for Stewart have yet to comment on the controversy. For someone celebrated for her keen aesthetic sense and attention to detail, this oversight reminds us that, in today’s world, the most lavish luxuries must be viewed through a lens of global responsibility.</p>

<p>Whether a simple oversight or a deeper indication of celebrity disconnect from pressing issues, this incident underscores the importance of environmental sensitivity - even when on vacation. As the world grapples with the implications of climate change, one hopes even our lifestyle leaders recognize the importance of treading lightly, on ice or otherwise.</p>
