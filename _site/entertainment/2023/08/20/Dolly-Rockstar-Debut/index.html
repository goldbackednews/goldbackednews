  <p>From being a shining star in the realm of country music to now exploring the riffs and rhythms of rock, Dolly Parton is all set to surprise her fans with her latest venture. Teaming up with none other than the legendary Beatles duo, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Parton has presented her rendition of the Beatles’ iconic song “Let It Be,” bringing it back to the limelight after more than five decades of its original release.</p>

<p><strong>An Iconic Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Taking to her Instagram to announce this exhilarating collaboration, Parton exclaimed, “Does it get any better than singing “Let It Be” with @paulmccartney who wrote the song.” The excitement didn’t end there. She added, “Well, it did get even better when Ringo Starr joined in on drums, Peter Frampton on guitar, and Mick Fleetwood playing percussion.”</p>

<p>The music world buzzed with appreciation and admiration. Paul McCartney responded to Parton’s post with a heartfelt message, “Thanks Dolly for doing my song. I love your version and am very pleased to be by your side on this one. Rock on.”</p>

<p><strong>A Dive into Rock</strong></p>

<p>The journey to rock for Dolly Parton is an interesting one. After her induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in May, Parton expressed her desire to create rock music. With a dash of nostalgia and a touch of ambition, she said, “When I got nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, I thought, well, no better time to do it.’ I had always wanted to do it.”</p>

<p>Her upcoming rock album, “Rockstar,” is set to release this fall. It promises to be a melodious blend of classics and contemporary hits, featuring tracks initially performed by renowned artists like Prince, Freddie Mercury, Sting, and Miley Cyrus.</p>

<p>In a touching tribute, Parton dedicates this album to her husband, Carl Thomas Dean. She remarked, “My husband is a big hard rock ’n’ roll fan, and for years I thought, ‘One of these days I’d like to do an album mainly just for him, just to kind of do it.’”</p>

<p><strong>A New Era for Parton</strong></p>

<p>Dolly Parton’s journey into rock is a testament to her versatile talent and the evergreen charm she brings into her music. As fans eagerly await the release of “Rockstar” on November 17, the world is sure to witness another dimension of this timeless artist’s magical prowess.</p>
