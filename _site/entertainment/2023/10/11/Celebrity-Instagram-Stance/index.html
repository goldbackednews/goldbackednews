  <p>In the wake of recent violent attacks by Hamas on Israel, resulting in over 1,100 Israeli casualties, top-tier celebrities on Instagram have been surprisingly quiet. An observation made just four days post the bloody events reveals that none of the ten most-followed celebrity Instagram accounts have expressed their support for Israel.</p>

<p>Beyonce, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and notable members of the Kardashian family, among others, have kept their opinions about the situation under wraps. The exception being Kylie Jenner who briefly posted a pro-Israel message, but quickly retracted and deleted it after a wave of negative responses.</p>

<p>Top celebrities like Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and football sensations Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have also refrained from commenting on the situation.</p>

<p>This lack of response might reflect a complex PR landscape for celebrities. Taking a stance on the Israel-Palestine issue can potentially alienate certain fanbases or invite media scrutiny, especially since mainstream news often leans anti-Israel.</p>

<p>However, these celebrities had been rather vocal when it came to supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in the past, even though it’s polarizing within the U.S. populace.</p>

<p>Recall Beyonce dedicating her 2020 BET Humanitarian Award to BLM supporters, Dwayne Johnson’s vocal support on Twitter alongside a critique of then-President Donald Trump, or Ariana Grande joining a BLM protest march in Los Angeles. Additionally, Selena Gomez expressed her solidarity with the BLM movement on Instagram, and both Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner contributed monetary donations.</p>

<p>Recently, the Chicago chapter of BLM voiced their support for Palestinians over Israel. Their post included a graphic illustrating a Hamas terrorist in a paragliding attack — mirroring the very tactic used against Israelis during a music festival on the weekend.</p>

<p>However, some celebrities have bucked the trend. Noteworthy figures like Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Mark Hamill, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Israeli natives Gal Gadot and Natalie Portman have been openly supportive of Israel during these trying times.</p>

<p>As tensions continue, the entertainment world’s response—or lack thereof—offers a fascinating glimpse into the intricate dance between celebrity influence and international politics.</p>
