  <p>Hollywood mourns the loss of a star, Suzanne Somers, who left an indelible mark both on and off-screen. Best known for her iconic role as “Chrissy Snow” on “Three’s Company,” Suzanne passed away at the age of 76 after a long battle with breast cancer.</p>

<p>Born in Northern California, Suzanne’s big break came in 1977 when she landed the role of the bubbly blonde roommate, Chrissy, in the hit sitcom “Three’s Company.” With her natural comedic timing and undeniable on-screen charisma, Somers quickly became a household name.</p>

<p>But Suzanne wasn’t just confined to the realms of television. Her business acumen led her to become the spokesperson, and eventually the owner, of the popular fitness product, ThighMaster. This at-home exercise device designed to tone legs reportedly netted her a staggering $300 million. Somers once quipped she stopped counting sales “after 10 million.”</p>

<p>She ventured further into the world of entrepreneurship, penning 27 books, with 14 hitting the New York Times bestseller list. Suzanne’s name adorned products ranging from jewelry to protein formula. Last year, she mentioned, “I have over a thousand products.” Her dedication to work was evident, even joking that her biggest complaint was that she “worked too much.”</p>

<p>Apart from her business endeavors, Suzanne’s resilience in her health journey was nothing short of inspiring. Diagnosed with skin cancer in her 30s and breast cancer in her 50s, she faced each challenge head-on, often combining alternative and conventional treatments. “Every time that little f—– pops up, I continue to bat it back,” she bravely stated in July, when she revealed her breast cancer’s recurrence.</p>

<p>Throughout her journey, her husband, Alan Hamel, was her unwavering pillar of support. Married since 1977, their love story was one that many admired. “I can’t even explain how much he has done for me. If it’s even possible, we are even closer than ever,” Suzanne once shared.</p>

<p>Suzanne’s life wasn’t without its challenges, but her ability to find joy in every moment set her apart. During the pandemic, she adapted to the digital age, engaging with fans through Facebook Live and Instagram shows. Always with a drink in hand and her husband behind the camera, Suzanne cherished the freedom the internet gave her compared to mainstream television.</p>

<p>A health-conscious individual, Suzanne was committed to an organic lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of toxin-free products in her household, especially after her cancer diagnoses.</p>

<p>As fans, friends, and family bid adieu to this multifaceted icon, they celebrate her extraordinary life, legacy, and the profound impact she had on countless lives. Whether through her infectious laugh on “Three’s Company,” her best-selling books, or her enduring love story with Alan, Suzanne Somers will always be remembered as a beacon of strength, talent, and inspiration.</p>
