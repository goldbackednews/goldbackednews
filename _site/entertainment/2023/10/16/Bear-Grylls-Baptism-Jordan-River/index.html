  <p>Renowned survivalist, TV personality, and author Bear Grylls recently lived a dream come true as he got baptized in the Jordan River, a location deeply significant in Christian traditions.</p>

<p>Grylls shared his profound moment with fans, expressing his elation at experiencing a sacrament in the very waters where, according to Christian beliefs, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. “It had always been a dream of mine to get in the water that Jesus was baptized in by my hero John the Baptist,” Grylls penned on his social media. Alongside his heartfelt message, he posted a photo capturing the poignant moment of his baptism.</p>

<p>Bear Grylls, over the years, has never shied away from discussing his faith. In 2022, during an engaging chat with Steven Bartlett on ‘The Diary of a CEO’, Grylls shed light on how his faith anchors him. He reminisced about his childhood, saying, “As a kid, I had a really natural faith, always felt there was something greater around.” However, he expressed regret over how modern perceptions of Christianity have been “tarnished”.</p>

<p>He further delved into his beliefs, emphasizing the power of faith as a guiding light. “Faith is in your heart, knowing that you are not alone. There’s something bigger than us out there,” he elaborated, highlighting the importance of love, trust, and empowerment.</p>

<p>Adding to this sentiment, in a conversation with the Christian Post, Grylls shared his concerns about the contemporary practices of many churches. Expressing his thoughts, he mentioned, “I think Jesus would really struggle with 99% of churches nowadays.” Grylls emphasized that the crux of faith lies in love, community, honesty, and staying close to one’s beliefs rather than being embroiled in the theatrics of religious practices.</p>

<p>Born in Ireland, the TV star proudly associates with the UK’s Anglican Church.</p>

<p>Grylls’ baptism in the Jordan River and his candid discussions about faith reflect the TV star’s deep-rooted beliefs. As fans continue to admire him for his thrilling survival shows, moments like these offer a glimpse into the man behind the adventure, showcasing a side that’s grounded in faith and spiritual reflection.</p>
