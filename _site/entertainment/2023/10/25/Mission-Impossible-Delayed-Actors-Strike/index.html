  <p>Hollywood is facing a major shakeup as the highly anticipated eighth installment of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise gets hit with a year-long delay, all due to the ongoing actors strike that has now surpassed a staggering three months of work stoppage.</p>

<p>Paramount Pictures made the announcement this Monday, shifting the release date of the next ‘Mission: Impossible’ film from its original slot on June 28 to a new date on May 23, 2025. The halt in production can be traced back to July, when lead actor Tom Cruise and the rest of the crew took a break for an international promotion tour for ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’.</p>

<p>The sequel, previously titled ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two’, is now simply listed as ‘Mission: Impossible’. Despite the prior installment’s success, grossing a substantial $567.5 million worldwide, it fell short of its predecessor, ‘Fallout’ ($791.7 million globally), and Cruise’s other major hit, ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ ($1.5 billion). The 163-minute-long action thriller received high praise, yet it quickly found itself overshadowed by blockbuster giants ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’.</p>

<p>This actor strike has not just impacted the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise; it is sending ripples throughout Hollywood, upsetting release plans for other major films. From this fall’s ‘Dune: Part Two’ being postponed to March, to delays and indefinite postponements of various Marvel and ‘Venom’ films, and even ‘Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse’, the industry is in a state of flux.</p>

<p>In light of these delays, Paramount Pictures has also adjusted the release schedule for other titles in their lineup. ‘A Quiet Place: Day One’, a prequel to the popular post-apocalyptic horror series and featuring Lupita Nyong’o, has had its release pushed from March to June 28, filling the slot originally occupied by ‘Mission: Impossible’.</p>

<p>Negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the studios are set to resume this Tuesday, leaving Hollywood and its eager audience in anticipation of what resolution—or further delays—may come.</p>
