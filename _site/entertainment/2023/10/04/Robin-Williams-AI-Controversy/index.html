  <p>Zelda Williams, daughter of the beloved late actor Robin Williams, has publicly criticized the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) to emulate her father’s distinctive voice. She described the technology-driven imitation as a “horrendous Frankensteinian monster.”</p>

<p>The Hollywood community, ever adapting to technological progress, recently encountered a controversial application of AI — recreating voices of actors, especially those who’ve passed away. The trend touched a nerve with Zelda, who articulated her disapproval in an impassioned Instagram Story.</p>

<p>She highlighted her unique standpoint, writing, “I am not an impartial voice in SAG’s fight against AI,” referencing the screen actors union. Zelda emphasized the ethical concerns, stating, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.”</p>

<p>While the impersonation of Robin’s voice might unsettle fans, the broader issue at hand extends beyond personal sentiments. “I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want,” Zelda remarked, pointing out the deeper implications of the technology.</p>

<p>Zelda’s main contention is with the principle behind the act. She believes that living actors “deserve a chance to create characters with their choices, to voice cartoons, to put their HUMAN effort and time into the pursuit of performance.” Using AI, she argues, can lead to shallow reproductions that lack the depth, emotion, and nuance that human actors bring to their roles.</p>

<p>In her pointed critique, she described AI simulations of actors as being, “at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”</p>

<p>This isn’t a lone outcry. Other prominent figures in Hollywood, like James Cameron, Christopher Nolan, and Tim Burton, have previously expressed reservations about such technology. Their combined voices raise a significant question about the industry’s future direction and the ethical considerations of AI.</p>

<p>As technology continues to push boundaries, Hollywood, and the world at large, will need to grapple with the moral quandaries it presents. Zelda’s candid remarks shed light on an issue that’s bound to grow more prominent in the coming years.</p>
