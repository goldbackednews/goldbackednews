  <p>Kanye West, also known as Ye, has been a dominant figure in the music and fashion industries, with his unique style and outspoken personality capturing the public’s attention. However, a new report from the New York Times has brought to light a darker side of the rapper’s actions, particularly during his partnership with Adidas.</p>

<p>The report details disturbing incidents, including West’s demand for a Jewish Adidas executive to kiss a photo of Adolf Hitler. This revelation adds another layer to the understanding of why Adidas decided to sever ties with the artist last year, initially thought to be a response to his public antisemitic outbursts.</p>

<p>Kanye’s partnership with Adidas, which began in 2013, was mutually beneficial for a time, with soaring profits and West’s brand Yeezys contributing significantly to his billionaire status. However, the report reveals that the company had been dealing with West’s erratic and troubling behavior for nearly a decade, often adapting to his demands and mood swings.</p>

<p>One of the most alarming revelations is an incident in 2013, where West, during a meeting at Adidas headquarters in Germany, drew a swastika on an Adidas sketch and told a Jewish executive to kiss a portrait of Hitler daily. He also expressed admiration for Hitler’s command of propaganda to Adidas employees.</p>

<p>The report, based on interviews with current and former employees and a review of internal documents, paints a picture of a company struggling to manage their star partner’s behavior while reaping the financial rewards of the partnership. Top executives and managers reportedly had a group chat named “Yzy hotline” to discuss how to handle any chaos caused by West, comparing their strategy to firefighting.</p>

<p>As Adidas grew more reliant on the Yeezy brand, West benefited significantly, receiving a 15 percent royalty on net sales, $15 million upfront, millions in company stock annually, and a $100 million annual fund for Yeezy marketing starting in 2019.</p>

<p>However, when the partnership ended last year amidst public backlash against West’s actions, Adidas projected its first annual loss in decades, and West’s net worth took a hit. Despite this, Adidas and West had one more financial interaction, as Adidas released the remaining $1.3 billion worth of Yeezys, with a portion of the proceeds going to charity, but most of the money going back to Adidas and royalties to West.</p>

<p>This report highlights the complex and often troubling nature of celebrity partnerships, raising questions about the responsibility of companies to take a stand against harmful behavior, even when there are significant financial incentives at play.</p>
