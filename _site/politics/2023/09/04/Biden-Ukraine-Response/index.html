  <p>The American electorate seems increasingly disenchanted with President Joe Biden’s approach towards the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. A recent Wall Street Journal poll indicates that a majority of American voters, 52 percent to be exact, disapprove of his handling of the situation. This number marks an increase from a previous poll in late March which had pegged disapproval at 46 percent.</p>

<p>While the exact issues of contention were not detailed in the poll, there appears to be a common sentiment that the US is perhaps too involved in the Ukraine crisis. A significant 38 percent of respondents felt that the US was offering excessive assistance to Ukraine. In comparison, 31 percent believed the support was just right, and a meager 22 percent opined that the US wasn’t doing enough.</p>

<p>Partisan lines are evident in these perspectives. A dominant 62 percent of Republican primary voters felt the US was overstepping, whereas only 17 percent believed the support was adequate. A mere 14 percent among them thought more could be done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, Biden has been vocal about his commitment to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recent events in the Ukraine war arena may have further shaped public opinion. Although Ukraine initiated a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russian forces, their progress hasn’t matched Western expectations.</p>

<p>Biden’s financial commitments to the crisis have also been under scrutiny. The president’s recent proposal of an additional $24 billion aid for Ukraine might intensify debates. If approved, this would elevate the total US spending on the Ukraine conflict to an eye-popping $135 billion since its commencement in February 2022.</p>

<p>The aforementioned WSJ poll was conducted between August 24 and 30, with insights from 1,500 registered voters, and a margin of error of ±2.5 percentage points.</p>
