  <p>Deepening concerns and raising eyebrows in the corridors of Washington, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has cast a shadow over former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of the alleged influence peddling saga. In a revealing conversation, Johnson pulled no punches, stating that Obama was “fully aware of a lot of this.”</p>

<p>Underpinning his claim with significant details, Johnson shed light on the fact that the Obama State Department was more than just familiar with the alleged influence peddling associated with Hunter Biden. To add fuel to the fire, Johnson explained, “President Obama was briefed, together with Vice President Biden, by then-CIA Director John Brennan about the scheme that the Hillary Clinton campaign had to accuse the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia.”</p>

<p>Making a hard-hitting assertion, Johnson underlined that Obama was in the know about the concocted narrative of Russian collusion. “President Obama knew full well that the Russian collusion scheme false narrative was a hoax,” he stated firmly.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the steps taken against Michael Flynn, he mentioned, “They certainly set up Michael Flynn so that he would never be involved in the Trump White House because he was just too dangerous. He knew too much.” For Johnson, the Obama administration’s actions toward Flynn smacked of ulterior motives, which he says extends to the broader influence peddling episode.</p>

<p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) recently missed a deadline to turn over documents associated with then-Vice President Joe Biden’s alias email accounts. These records are of particular interest to the House Oversight Committee, which is meticulously combing through the Hunter Biden situation. As it stands, the Biden White House and former President Obama have received the documents, with permission pending for their release to the Oversight Committee.</p>

<p>Johnson, expressing his growing exasperation, stated, “Sen. Grassley and I have written multiple letters, three to the White House, starting in the summer of 2021, asking for those same documents.” He emphasized the consistent stonewalling they’ve faced from the current administration.</p>

<p>Taking a direct jab at Obama, Johnson remarked, “I don’t know why he’s not allowing to release them now,” hinting at possible inconsistencies in Obama’s approach.</p>

<p>Johnson’s revelations point to a possible impeachment inquiry, emphasizing the duty of Congress to maintain constitutional oversight. As the layers of this political drama unfold, Johnson’s words paint a picture that many in Washington would rather remain hidden.</p>
