  <p>New Hampshire’s primary stage was recently set with a dramatic backdrop, with Secretary of State Dave Scanlan firmly deciding not to block former President Donald Trump from appearing on the presidential primary ballot, despite looming controversies.</p>

<p>In a Concord news conference, Scanlan detailed the requirements for Trump’s participation — a declaration of candidacy under penalty of perjury and a $1,000 filing fee. He emphasized that the language guiding this decision was unequivocal, leaving no room for discretion.</p>

<p>Republican Bryant “Corky” Messner, aided by Trump in securing the 2020 Republican Senate nomination, has been an outspoken critic, even contemplating legal recourse should Trump’s name feature on the ballot. Central to Messner’s argument is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which focuses on prohibiting those having engaged in “insurrection or rebellion” from holding office.</p>

<p>In the wake of Trump’s announcement of a third White House run, this Amendment has increasingly become a central theme. Given recent indictments against Trump in federal court and in Georgia, efforts to invoke the 14th Amendment have intensified.</p>

<p>Yet, Scanlan was unyielding in his stand. He highlighted that there was no mention in New Hampshire’s statute that permits a presidential primary candidate to be disqualified based on the 14th Amendment, particularly referencing insurrection or rebellion.</p>

<p>While most state secretaries have hesitated in removing presidential candidates independently, the final decision might land on the U.S. Supreme Court’s desk, a body that hasn’t adjudicated on the relevant clause in the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>A day before Scanlan’s declaration, a letter from the Trump campaign, backed by numerous Republican state lawmakers, urged Scanlan to disregard what they described as “an absurd conspiracy theory.”</p>

<p>The political tapestry further complicates with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seeking to redefine its 2024 election cycle calendar, a move that threatens New Hampshire’s historic place as the inaugural primary. The DNC’s plan, aiming to reflect more diversity, has encountered stiff resistance in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Despite the pushback, Scanlan remains steadfast, alluding that New Hampshire’s actions will be independent of DNC’s decisions. The repercussions could be significant, with New Hampshire potentially losing half of its delegates to the Democratic presidential nominating convention due to DNC penalties.</p>

<p>Many Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire speculate that the calendar reshuffling may be a retaliatory measure, referencing Biden’s underwhelming performance in both states during the 2020 primary season.</p>

<p>While Scanlan has only confirmed the filing period, the tentative dates suggest New Hampshire’s primary could be on January 23, just over a week post Iowa’s GOP presidential caucus.</p>

<p>For now, New Hampshire’s political battleground remains intense and unpredictable as the primary date approaches.</p>
