  <p>In an enlightening interview, former President Donald Trump recently argued against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, claiming her decisions played a significant role in the events that transpired on January 6th.</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-not-taken">The Decision Not Taken</h3>

<p>Speaking with NBC’s “Meet the Press” host, Kristen Welker, Trump didn’t hold back. He stated, “Nancy Pelosi was in charge of security. She turned down 10,000 soldiers. If she didn’t turn down the soldiers, you wouldn’t have had Jan. 6.”</p>

<p>Welker challenged Trump’s stance, mentioning that Pelosi lacked the same security authority he possessed as the commander in chief. But Trump countered by highlighting how the Capitol police, who he described as “great people,” had testified against Pelosi.</p>

<em>Former President Donald Trump holds firm to his belief that former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, played a significant role in the Jan. 6 events.</em></p>

<p>Trump reiterated that Pelosi held authority over the Capitol and that her alleged refusal to bolster security with the National Guard, even after his request, was a major oversight. In his eyes, Pelosi’s decision is a clear indicator of her responsibility for the events of January 6th.</p>

<h3 id="different-versions-of-the-story">Different Versions of the Story</h3>

<p>Naturally, there have been conflicting accounts on who was responsible for the security decisions that day. Some point out that the choice to summon National Guard troops to the Capitol rests with the Capitol Police Board, which includes members like the House and Senate sergeants at arms. These officials reportedly decided against deploying the Guard before the riots but called for backup when the situation intensified.</p>

<p>The former Capitol Police Chief, Steven Sund, previously stated to <em>The Washington Post</em> that he had requested backup several times both before and during the riot. According to him, these pleas were either delayed or denied outright.</p>

<p>When asked about his leadership during those tumultuous events, Trump confidently stated, “Yes, absolutely, I did.” He also touched upon the allegations made against him, refuting claims by a former aide and making it clear that he felt the charges against him were politically motivated.</p>

<p>Regardless of where one stands on this issue, it’s evident that the January 6th event will remain a significant topic of debate and discussion in political circles. As investigations and inquiries continue, the hope is that a clearer picture of responsibility and accountability will emerge.</p>
