  <p>Former President Donald Trump, known for his candid expressions and unfiltered opinions, blasted President Joe Biden’s recent deal with Iran. Labeled by Trump as a “6 Billion Dollar Hostage Deal,” this agreement has drawn attention and criticism from several corners.</p>

<h3 id="a-lopsided-deal">A Lopsided Deal?</h3>

<p>In a candid post on Truth Social, Trump declared that this Iran deal has established a “terrible PRECEDENT for the future.” Expressing his concerns, he warned his followers and the general public to “buckle up” for the potential aftermath of such a deal. Highlighting the past reputation of the United States, he remarked that the once “highly respected USA” has now turned into a “laughingstock” globally.</p>

<p>His comments were in light of the recent event where five U.S. citizens were freed from Iranian custody. In exchange, the U.S. released five Iranian prisoners and unfroze $6 billion in Iranian assets that were under U.S. sanctions.</p>

<h3 id="trumps-perspective">Trump’s Perspective</h3>

<p>While Trump did commend the release of the American hostages, he heavily criticized the price at which their freedom came. Comparing this situation with his tenure as President, he boasted of bringing home 58 hostages from various countries, including North Korea, without any ransom payments. He implied that his strong stance made countries rethink their hostage negotiation strategies. “Toward the end, it got so that countries didn’t even start the conversation asking for money, because they knew they would not get it,” Trump stated.</p>

<p>Continuing his critique, Trump expressed his apprehension that such deals might pave the way for what he calls “hostage inflation.” According to him, if countries see that the U.S. is willing to pay billions for the safe return of its citizens, more Americans could potentially be taken hostage in the future.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-future-hold">What’s the Future Hold?</h3>

<p>The implication of Trump’s statements is clear. He firmly believes that once a precedent of payment is set, the demands will only increase, leading to more Americans at risk overseas. In his signature style, he concluded by labelling President Biden as “Dumb as a ROCK!” and blaming him for this deal.</p>

<p>Only time will tell whether Trump’s fears are realized or if this deal will pave the way for smoother international relations. However, his concerns serve as a reminder to always tread cautiously on the international stage.</p>
