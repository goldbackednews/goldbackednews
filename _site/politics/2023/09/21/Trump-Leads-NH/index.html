  <p>In a twist of political fate, Former President Donald Trump has taken a strong lead in New Hampshire, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has dramatically fallen to fifth place. This surprising turn was found in a recent CNN New Hampshire Primary Poll.</p>

<h2 id="trump-towers-in-the-granite-state">Trump Towers in the Granite State</h2>

<p>According to the poll, Trump leads the GOP primary race with an impressive 39% support. This places him a whopping 26 points ahead of the second contender, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who gathered 13% of the votes.</p>

<p>Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina Governor, wasn’t far behind Ramaswamy with 12% support. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was next in line with 11%.</p>

<h2 id="desantis-faces-a-setback">DeSantis Faces a Setback</h2>

<p>Perhaps the biggest news from the poll was DeSantis’s decline. After announcing earlier this summer that his campaign would focus on the first three states, including New Hampshire, the latest poll reveals he has only managed to garner 10% support, placing him fifth.</p>

<p>This represents a significant 13-point dip from a survey conducted in July, where DeSantis was shown to have 23% support in New Hampshire. Changes in his campaign strategy, staff layoffs, and a change in campaign management may have contributed to this sharp decline.</p>

<h2 id="a-deeper-dive-into-voter-sentiments">A Deeper Dive into Voter Sentiments</h2>

<p>The survey also shed light on the commitment of the voter base. A substantial 69% of Trump supporters stated they’re sure about supporting him, while only 18% of DeSantis supporters felt the same conviction for their candidate.</p>

<p>When participants were questioned about which candidate they felt had the best chance to win the 2024 presidential general election, over half (51%) vouched for Trump. DeSantis lagged far behind with only 16% believing in his chances.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>While the political landscape can be unpredictable, this recent survey clearly indicates a shift in the wind. With DeSantis’s position dwindling in both national and state-wide polls, and Trump’s strong presence in New Hampshire, the 2024 GOP primary race is shaping up to be an intriguing one.</p>
