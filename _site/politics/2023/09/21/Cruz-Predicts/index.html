  <p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz has sparked conversations with a bold prediction: the Democrats might opt for former First Lady Michelle Obama to replace President Joe Biden for the 2024 elections. According to Cruz, the Dems are getting increasingly “nervous” about Biden’s potential run.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-prediction">The Big Prediction</h2>

<p>On his podcast, “Verdict with Ted Cruz”, the Senator voiced that the odds of Biden not getting the Democrat nomination have “risen significantly.” Citing reasons, he pointed to polling numbers indicating two-thirds of Americans believe Biden might be too old for presidency and emerging concerns about Biden’s connections and possible corruptions.</p>

<p>Cruz did not shy away from pointing fingers at the media. According to him, their changing stance on Biden signifies the Democrats’ contemplation of a potential change in leadership.</p>

<h2 id="michelle-obama---the-unexpected-game-changer">Michelle Obama - The Unexpected Game-Changer?</h2>

<p>If the Democratic National Convention sees Biden’s “mental diminishment” become more evident, Cruz believes the platform will serve as a launching pad for Michelle Obama. His reasoning? Bringing in Michelle Obama would not alienate African American women voters - a significant constituent for the Democrats.</p>

<p>Having served as the First Lady, Cruz argues that Michelle has the leverage to bypass other top Democratic contenders and could be viewed as the Obamas’ attempt to “save the day.”</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind The Scenes</h2>

<p>Moreover, Cruz opined that former President Barack Obama might already be the unseen hand guiding the Biden administration. “I don’t think Joe Biden is the decision maker,” Cruz stated, suggesting Barack’s influential role. He warns that if media sentiment continues to turn on Biden, the chances of seeing Michelle Obama in the 2024 race could increase.</p>

<p>Considering a hypothetical scenario where Biden willingly steps down, Cruz joked that the Democrats might herald him as the “biggest hero” in their history.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Positioning Democrats as being “dynastic” and “command and control”, Cruz believes Michelle already holds a superior position within the Democratic hierarchy than most contenders. He concludes by suggesting that her nomination might be the “only solution” that doesn’t lead to internal strife within the party.</p>

<p>While the political arena is unpredictable, Cruz’s observations offer an intriguing perspective on the potential future of American politics.</p>
