  <p>Hunter Biden’s recent indictment has taken the nation by storm. However, what’s capturing even more attention is the seemingly lenient approach the Department of Justice (DOJ) is taking toward his case, especially when considering its historical hard stance on similar matters.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-treatment-of-a-presidents-son">The Surprising Treatment of a President’s Son</h2>

<p>Hunter Biden’s case isn’t just any case. He’s the first son of a sitting U.S. president to face criminal indictment. While it’s big news, insiders suggest that there’s more to come in this unfolding saga.</p>

<p>A former federal prosecutor has expressed deep concern over how the DOJ has been conducting a five-year investigation into Hunter Biden’s case. The evidence pointing toward corruption and severe criminal actions appears evident.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-hunters-case-to-traditional-doj-action">Comparing Hunter’s Case to Traditional DOJ Action</h2>

<p>Historically, the DOJ has been strict, particularly when dealing with firearms offenses. This approach is in line with the Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), an initiative established over two decades ago to address such offenses.</p>

<p>The program has seen every attorney general’s support, even the current one, Merrick Garland. Through this initiative, countless Americans have been sentenced to an average of 40 months in federal prison for similar gun charges. However, Hunter Biden’s treatment seems to diverge from these typical outcomes.</p>

<p>In his role, the former federal prosecutor has dealt with numerous firearms cases. Never has he seen a case with such compelling evidence being settled without charges. After sifting through data of over 189,000 illegal firearms possession cases, not one was found to be given an offer of diversion by the DOJ.</p>

<h2 id="the-controversial-sweetheart-deal">The Controversial Sweetheart Deal</h2>

<p>It caused quite a stir when the DOJ tried to settle Hunter Biden’s case without bringing any charges and even proposed immunity for unrelated charges. But, thanks to a vigilant federal judge, that deal was stopped in its tracks.</p>

<p>However, weeks later, three indictments were filed against Hunter. These were for allegedly making false statements when buying a gun and for possessing a gun while being addicted to drugs.</p>

<h2 id="more-evidence-awaiting-in-the-wings">More Evidence Awaiting in the Wings?</h2>

<p>There seems to be a treasure trove of evidence against Hunter Biden. An abandoned laptop, containing compromising emails, pictures, and videos, seems to point toward serious criminal activity. This, combined with testimony from a former business associate and revelations from House committee investigations, paints a grim picture.</p>

<p>The available evidence seems to indicate the creation of fake companies, collaboration of co-conspirators, and a grand scheme to earn millions from foreign entities. Yet, the DOJ’s investigation seems to overlook these potential charges.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-question">The Big Question</h2>

<p>If the evidence is as compelling as it appears, why aren’t Hunter and Joe Biden facing the level of scrutiny that others in similar situations have encountered? Many feel that there’s a false sense of security that they will never face serious consequences.</p>

<p>Only time will tell if justice will prevail in its true form, or if a different set of rules applies to those in power.</p>
