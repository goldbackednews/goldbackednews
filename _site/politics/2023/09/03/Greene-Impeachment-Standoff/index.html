  <p>In a bold move, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has ignited controversy by declaring she would vote against government funding if the House of Representatives refuses to initiate an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Greene’s call for impeachment revolves around allegations of corruption concerning overseas business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>Greene voiced her discontent with the White House’s backlash over her recent remarks on the microblogging platform, X (previously known as Twitter). She asserted, “The White House is attacking me for demanding an impeachment inquiry before I’ll vote to fund one penny to our over bloated $32 TRILLION dollar in debt failing government.” Emphasizing her standpoint, Greene further elaborated, “Should we inquire? Should we just take a look? Dare we investigate further? The answer is YES but the White House is outraged at my audacity to demand it.”</p>

<p>During her Floyd County Town Hall on Thursday, Greene expressed her strong reservations against funding the government unless Congress prioritizes the impeachment inquiry, curbs “Biden’s weaponization of government”, and ceases U.S. monetary assistance for Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. Additionally, she highlighted the necessity of eliminating COVID-19-related mask and vaccine mandates.</p>

<p>In response, the White House’s spokesperson, Andrew Bates, labeled Greene as a representative of the “hardcore fringe” within the Republican Party. Bates warned of the dire consequences that could arise due to any rash decisions by extreme House members, potentially leading to a government shutdown that could adversely impact the economy, disaster readiness, and the nation’s troops.</p>

<p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., signaled his willingness to advance the impeachment inquiry concerning Biden and his family’s overseas financial dealings. However, he stipulated the need for an official House vote for the same. This decisive vote could potentially be scheduled for later this month, once the legislative sessions recommence.</p>

<p>The looming deadline to fund the government is set for September 30. McCarthy has informed House GOP colleagues about his anticipation of endorsing a short-term solution to prevent a government shutdown. This temporary resolution will be pursued while the Republican-majority House and Democrat-controlled Senate work towards a consensus on a comprehensive, long-term budget.</p>

<p>With the government’s new fiscal year around the corner, starting on October 1, the urgency for funding approval is palpable. A failure to achieve this could result in the unfortunate shutdown of several federal offices.</p>
