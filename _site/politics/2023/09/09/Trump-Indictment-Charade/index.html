  <p>In what appears to be the latest episode in a long-running campaign to delegitimize President Donald Trump’s legacy, Fulton County’s most recent grand jury report smells more of partisan foul play than of actual justice. The inconsistency in indictments is not just eyebrow-raising but also an affront to any reasonable sense of fairness and impartiality.</p>

<p>The CEO of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, Devin Nunes, raises valid concerns. Out of the 39 Republicans initially poised for indictment, why were only 19 actually charged? The arithmetic doesn’t add up and indeed begs the question Nunes posed on “The Chris Salcedo Show”: “That just makes no sense. It just leads to more questions and answers.”</p>

<p>This whole charade turns even more baffling when we find out that some heavy hitters, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, the then-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, were among the names originally slated for indictment. If such a key figure can be in the crosshairs and then suddenly be off the hook, how are we to trust the very premise of these accusations?</p>

<p>Devin Nunes’ clarion call for Governor Brian Kemp to step up and address this glaring anomaly is more than justified. Kemp’s past disagreements with Trump notwithstanding, this situation transcends personal conflicts and ventures into the realm of safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process in Georgia.</p>

<p>The Associated Press’s revelation that the grand jury was overwhelmingly in favor of indicting an additional 20 Republicans adds another layer of intrigue. Why did District Attorney Fani Willis backpedal? Was it truly due to a lack of evidence, or were other opaque factors at play?</p>

<p>Nunes succinctly summarizes the predicament: “You just had 20 people who walked away innocent, scot-free … in a normal working system, nearly all of those people should have been indicted, or they all should not have been indicted.”</p>

<p>The state of Georgia stands at a critical juncture. It can either choose to further mire itself in controversial, questionable legal maneuvers or rise above partisan pettiness and ensure a fair and transparent judicial process.</p>

<p>For now, though, one thing is crystal clear: the grand jury’s recent actions in Fulton County have left more Americans skeptical and demanding answers. And rightly so.</p>
