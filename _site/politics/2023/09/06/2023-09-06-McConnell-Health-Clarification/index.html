  <p>In recent days, concerns about Republican Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s health were in the limelight after he paused for an extended period during a public address. The Capitol attending physician has now stepped forward to address these concerns, providing a much-needed clarity on the GOP leader’s condition.</p>

<p>Dr. Brian Monahan, Sen. McConnell’s attending physician, recently issued a comprehensive statement after performing an extensive neurological assessment on the Senator. According to Monahan, various tests, including a brain MRI imaging and an EEG study, showed “no evidence” that the Senator had suffered a stroke, TIA, or any movement disorder such as Parkinson’s disease. Monahan further emphasized that there’s no need to adjust McConnell’s current treatments stemming from his fall in March 2023.</p>

<p>These health concerns took root after an episode last week in Covington, Kentucky. While responding to a reporter’s question on his re-election plans for 2026, Sen. McConnell appeared to lose his train of thought and went silent for over half a minute. This “freeze” was particularly alarming as it came a month after a similar occurrence during a Capitol news conference.</p>

<p>However, after the episode, a spokesperson for McConnell provided insights into his condition. “Leader McConnell felt momentarily lightheaded and paused during his press conference today,” they said.</p>

<p>Despite these moments of concern, Dr. Monahan gave the go-ahead for the Senator to resume his regular schedule. Commenting on McConnell’s occasional lightheadedness, the physician explained that such symptoms are not uncommon during concussion recovery, suggesting that dehydration might also play a role.</p>

<p>This year has been challenging health-wise for the 81-year-old Senator. Earlier in the year, McConnell had a severe fall in a Washington hotel, resulting in a concussion and a fractured rib. After spending some time in an inpatient rehabilitation facility, he made his return to the Senate. With the recent clarifications, supporters and colleagues hope for McConnell’s continued contribution to the political landscape without further health concerns.</p>
