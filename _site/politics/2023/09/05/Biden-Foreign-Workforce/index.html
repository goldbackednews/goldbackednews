  <p>In what can only be termed as a perplexing move, President Joe Biden plans to massively enhance the foreign-born workforce in the US. This decision aims to introduce approximately half a million foreign workers to American jobs, while an astounding 44 million native-born Americans languish unemployed.</p>

<p>Recent analysis by Goldman Sachs economists paints a worrying picture: Biden’s initiative to expand the US legal immigration system—routinely bringing in over a million foreign nationals annually on green cards and another million on temporary work visas—will usher in about 500,000 foreign workers by mid-June next year.</p>

<p>Biden’s move, economists argue, inflates the labor market monthly with tens of thousands of foreign workers that employers can engage, frequently at reduced wages and diminished benefits. The crux? “… growth in the foreign-born labor force has accelerated by 50k to 160k per month this year…” they point out.</p>

<p>Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, indicates the long-term consequences of this approach: “rebalancing” the labor market. This strategy is not skewed in favor of American employees but leans heavily toward employers, putting a strain on wage growth and causing it to decelerate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This raises a pressing question: Why is the Biden administration sidelining the local workforce in favor of foreign workers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) recently disclosed alarming data: more than 44 million native-born Americans are conspicuously absent from the labor market. This figure does not even encompass the multitude of native-born Americans included in regular unemployment statistics.</p>

<p>The decline in labor force participation among native-born Americans over the past two decades starkly contrasts with the steady rise in foreign-born workers. From 1960 to 2023, there was an increase of nearly 14 million native-born American men (16 to 64 years old) who were not participating in the labor market. Conversely, during this same period, the number of foreign-born workers in the same age range spiked by 13.7 million.</p>

<p>This trend glaringly impacts America’s working and lower-middle classes. Research from the CIS, by Steven Camarota and Karen Zeigler, highlight that U.S.-born men without bachelor’s degrees have seen a steady decline in labor force participation over the decades. By April of this year, only 77.3% of these men participated in the workforce.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, foreign-born men in the same demographic have a significantly higher participation rate in the workforce. In April, 85.8% of these foreign-born, working-class men were employed—nearly 10% more than their native-born counterparts.</p>

<p>It’s evident: Biden’s decision to favor the foreign workforce over native-born Americans is not only puzzling but also, many would argue, misguided. At a time when millions of Americans are seeking employment, prioritizing foreign workers raises serious concerns about the administration’s commitment to American workers.</p>
