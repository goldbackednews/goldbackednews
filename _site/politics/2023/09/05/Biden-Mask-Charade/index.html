  <p>In a move that’s becoming all too familiar, President Joe Biden has once again opted to wear a mask indoors, this time in the wake of First Lady Jill Biden’s second positive COVID-19 test, despite her double vaccination and two booster shots.</p>

<p>The White House’s stance, as announced by press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, is that the President will don his mask as a preventive measure. However, this decision seems more aligned with optics than science.</p>

<p>A study from the Cochrane Library states quite clearly that medical or surgical masks make “little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI)/COVID-19 like illness compared to not wearing masks.” Even the esteemed Dr. Anthony Fauci, in a candid email from February 5, 2020, stated, “The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.”</p>

<p>Yet, here we are, watching as Biden places his trust in a method Dr. Fauci once claimed might provide only a “slight benefit.” If the science isn’t enough to convince the President, what is?</p>

<p>Biden’s continued reliance on masking seems to be more of a nod to political pressures than a respect for empirical evidence. Over the years, he’s made several erroneous claims related to COVID-19, including the misleading assertion that vaccinated individuals cannot contract or spread the virus. One can’t help but wonder if this mask saga is merely a continuation of such missteps.</p>

<p>But it’s not just Biden. Despite an array of data suggesting masks might be of little use in the broader population, many Democrats continue to champion their use. Their reasoning often boils down to individual benefits, seemingly sidestepping the larger implications for society.</p>

<p>To mask or not to mask? That’s the question. And while it’s everyone’s personal choice, leaders should be grounded in science, not theater.</p>
