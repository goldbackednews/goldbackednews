  <p>In a striking deviation from her previous fervor, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appears to have placed the ongoing southern border crisis on the backburner during the Biden administration.</p>

<p>During Trump’s tenure, the Congresswoman made multiple high-profile trips to federal migrant detention facilities. Ocasio-Cortez’s theatrical 2019 visit, where she posted a photo of herself shedding tears outside a Texas migrant facility, became emblematic of her criticism against Trump’s border policies. Yet, the same passionate advocate has been markedly silent on border issues under President Biden’s leadership.</p>

<h3 id="new-york-over-southern-border">New York Over Southern Border</h3>

<p>In a recent interview with the New York Times, when questioned about her conspicuous absence from the border during Biden’s term, Ocasio-Cortez artfully dodged, emphasizing her tours of “New York-area facilities.”</p>

<p>This diversion prompts a legitimate query: Is the border crisis less of a humanitarian issue and more of a political pawn for AOC and the Democratic Party?</p>

<h3 id="actions-speak-louder-than-words">Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h3>

<p>Ocasio-Cortez’s rhetoric has often painted a bleak picture of the border situation, including questionable claims, such as Border Patrol agents in Texas allegedly “whipping” Haitian migrants – a narrative that was later debunked.</p>

<p>Yet, actions speak louder than words. If the border crisis was indeed a pressing concern for the Congresswoman, wouldn’t the sharp escalation of migrant numbers under Biden warrant a visit?</p>

<p>Republicans, rightly so, have highlighted the growing predicament at the southern border, noting the staggering number of 2.3 million illegal migrants crossing the border this fiscal year alone.</p>

<h3 id="blue-state-tensions-rise">Blue State Tensions Rise</h3>

<p>The escalating crisis is not just a point of contention for the GOP. Blue state Democrats, including NYC Mayor Eric Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, have voiced their exasperation at the Biden administration’s handling of the situation. Busloads of migrants arriving in cities like New York, Chicago, and Boston from border states like Texas only compound the issue, stretching resources thin and fanning frustrations.</p>

<p>Prominent business leaders in NYC, including top executives from major firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Wells Fargo, have penned an open letter to President Biden and Congress, pressing for increased federal aid to manage the influx.</p>

<h3 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>While Ocasio-Cortez has been a champion of numerous causes, her conspicuous absence on the border issue during Biden’s term suggests a possible double standard. Is it fair for the public to ask if her prior visits were mere photo opportunities, or does she genuinely care about the humanitarian aspects of the border crisis? As the saying goes, consistency is the true measure of integrity.</p>
