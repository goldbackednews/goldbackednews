  <p>In a recent development, former President Donald Trump, amidst swirling allegations, clarified his stance to NBC News, firmly stating that he did not instruct any staff member at Mar-a-Lago to delete security video footage. This follows charges in late July that alleged Trump and two of his employees tried to delete footage from his Florida estate.</p>

<p>In a candid conversation with “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, Trump categorically labeled the allegations against him as “false”. Emphasizing his point, when quizzed about his willingness to testify under oath, Trump didn’t flinch, asserting, “Sure, I’m going to — I’ll testify.”</p>

<p>A significant revelation from Trump highlighted that the tapes in question were never deleted. “But more importantly, the tapes weren’t deleted. In other words, there was nothing done to them. And they were my tapes. I could have fought them. I didn’t even have to give them the tapes, I don’t think,” Trump emphasized.</p>

<p>While Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet, and Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance supervisor at Mar-a-Lago, have both been charged with obstruction, Trump has consistently maintained a clean slate. Prosecutors allege that the two, following a subpoena, instructed an unnamed staffer to delete the tapes, claiming that “the boss” had made the request.</p>

<p>Trump’s steadfast claim to innocence doesn’t stop with the tapes. The former President faces multiple trials, yet he remains undeterred, stating he’s done nothing wrong. Addressing the possibility of a self-pardon should he win the 2024 general election, Trump told NBC, “What, what did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything wrong. You mean, because I challenge an election, they want to put me in jail?”</p>

<p>As the nation watches closely, Trump’s interview with “Meet the Press” promises more insights and is scheduled to air this Sunday.</p>
