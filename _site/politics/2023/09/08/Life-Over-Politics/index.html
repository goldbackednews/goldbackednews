  <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has resoundingly affirmed his unwavering commitment to the pro-life cause, emphasizing that the right to life holds more weight than political gamesmanship. During a candid interview with Newsmax’s “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Pence declared that the value of life is paramount, even more so than winning an election.</p>

<p>In a charged political environment where political calculations often override principles, Pence’s bold proclamation stands out. Challenging a common belief, Pence dismissed the notion, earlier suggested by former President Trump, that their administration lost midterm elections because of overturning Roe v. Wade. “I don’t believe that for a second,” Pence responded.</p>

<p>More than just politics, Pence views the right to life as a deep moral conviction. He expressed concerns about some wanting to reduce the life issue to a state-level matter. “For me, right to life’s not a state issue, it’s a moral issue. I’ll be a champion for right to life in the Oval Office,” he passionately conveyed.</p>

<p>Pence’s words weren’t solely about unborn children but extended to women in distressing situations as well. His remarks highlight the compassion underlying the pro-life stance: “I think when you stand on the right to life, you stand with principle and compassion and demonstrate not just a willingness to put our arms around the unborn but around newborns and women in crisis.”</p>

<p>Drawing parallels with international sentiment, Pence highlighted that most European nations have restrictions on abortion after the unborn child can feel pain. This aligns with the beliefs of a vast majority of Americans, with 70% sharing this sentiment.</p>

<p>While the GOP primary is unfolding with various stances and policies, Pence wants to be recognized for his unwavering conservative approach. He refrained from diving deep into the populist policies of Trump, only emphasizing that their administration had always governed with conservative principles.</p>

<p>Pence’s interview underscores his dedication to the pro-life movement. As the political sphere evolves with various narratives, Pence’s commitment to life, compassion, and moral values remains unshaken.</p>
