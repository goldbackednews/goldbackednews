  <p>In a rapidly escalating political development, House Republicans have addressed a strongly-worded letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. This letter, penned by prominent Republican figures, alleges that Hunter Biden’s legal team actively sought to “intimidate and harass” two key whistleblowers from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) during the ongoing tax investigation into the President’s son.</p>

<p>Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Jason Smith (R-MO), and James Comer (R-KY) named the IRS whistleblowers as Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler. These individuals recently came forward, suggesting that political machinations interfered with prosecutorial decisions spanning the extensive federal examination of Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>Notably, the letter levels severe accusations at Biden’s attorneys, asserting they “slandered” Shapley and Ziegler, painting them as “disgruntled”. Furthermore, it contends that Biden’s legal team pressured the Department of Justice to seek prosecution against these whistleblowers.</p>

<p>“Federal law safeguards whistleblowers from undue retaliation. The overt efforts to coerce these whistleblowers spark grave concerns about possible obstructions in our Committees’ inquiry,” the GOP leaders penned in the letter. They subsequently requested details on any endeavors by Hunter Biden’s lawyers to coax the Department into taking punitive action against the mentioned IRS whistleblowers.</p>

<p>In a revealing highlight, the letter references a New York Times report. According to this article, Biden’s legal team argued with the Justice Department that the whistleblowers “violated the law by sharing investigation details with Congress and should consequently face legal proceedings.”</p>

<p>With the clock ticking, the Republicans have given the DOJ a deadline until September 26, 5 p.m., to present any correspondences from Hunter Biden’s attorneys that “call for the investigation or prosecution” of the whistleblowers. Additionally, any documented communication between Biden’s lawyers and the DOJ about potential criminal investigations against Shapley or Ziegler is also sought.</p>

<p>On the horizon, Attorney General Garland is slated to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on September 20 for a routine oversight hearing.</p>

<p>This news coincides with the expectation that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) will soon endorse an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, focusing on allegations tied to his son’s controversial business associations.</p>
