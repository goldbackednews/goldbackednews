  <p>As the Kentucky gubernatorial election looms closer, incumbent Democratic Governor Andy Beshear finds himself at the center of a scathing new television advertisement campaign. The ad, released by the conservative-aligned School Freedom Fund, sharply criticizes Beshear for his decision to potentially release certain prisoners at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Among these prisoners was James Hamlin, who was accused and later convicted of sodomizing a six-year-old child.</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>

<p>In the early stages of the pandemic, amidst concerns of virus spread in crowded facilities, Governor Beshear signed an order titled “Conditional Commutation of Sentence.” The order aimed at reducing the inmate population in Kentucky’s overcrowded prisons. This action was taken in response to the heightened risk presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The order detailed a list of 697 inmates convicted of “non-violent, non-sexual offenses” whose sentences were set to expire by the end of September 2020. However, included in this list was James Hamlin.</p>

<p>Hamlin, whose Facebook page contained disturbing comments about minors, was rearrested shortly after the order and subsequently convicted of heinous charges. He is now slated to remain behind bars until 2044, with a possibility for parole in 2039.</p>

<h2 id="broader-implications">Broader Implications</h2>

<p>The advertisement equates the decision to release such prisoners as putting “deviant predators before innocent kids” and describes such choices as “not just wrong, it’s unforgivable.” Drawing parallels to the controversial Willie Horton ads from the 1988 presidential election, this new campaign against Beshear has the potential to drastically affect the outcome of the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Current public polls suggest a favorable leaning towards Beshear, but the provocative nature of the advertisement might sway public opinion. Governor Beshear’s potential missteps during the early days of the pandemic have previously been highlighted by the School Freedom Fund in another advertisement, spotlighting criminals with “means and motive.”</p>

<p>A 2021 report from Kentucky’s Administrative Office of Courts added more fuel to the fire. It pointed out that of the 1,704 individuals who had their sentences commuted by Beshear, 553 were later charged with felonies.</p>

<h2 id="the-larger-picture">The Larger Picture</h2>

<p>This controversy comes at a crucial time, with only three major gubernatorial elections slated for 2023. Apart from Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi are the other states headed for a gubernatorial showdown. With the Republicans eager to turn the tables after a lackluster 2022 midterm, flipping Kentucky’s and Louisiana’s governor’s mansions from blue to red would offer a significant boost.</p>

<p>Insiders believe that this is just the beginning and that more such ads can be expected as election day nears, raising the stakes in an already high-voltage political atmosphere.</p>
