  <p>In a candid conversation with “Rob Schmitt Tonight,” Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., voiced his concerns regarding the United States’ recent decision to partake in prisoner swaps with Iran. Highlighting the potential repercussions of such moves, Waltz emphasized that this could unintentionally encourage more hostage-taking incidents by hostile entities in the future.</p>

<p>Waltz, expressing his sympathy and heartbreak for the affected families, recounted an earlier incident in 2015 involving the Iran deal. “One of these hostages was left behind back in 2015 with the original Iran deal. John Kerry, [Then-Secretary of State], was promised the hostage’s release. However, even after the hostage remained in captivity, Kerry went ahead and signed the deal.”</p>

<p>Drawing parallels with the current scenario, Waltz expressed his concerns: “The problem with this deal is that future Americans are at risk of being taken hostage all over again.” Waltz’s argument is based on a simple yet concerning principle: When nations like the US give in to the demands of hostage-takers, it provides a strong incentive for other hostile actors, whether they are nations like Iran or Russia, or even terrorist groups, to follow suit.</p>

<p>He further added, “There’s no downside for these hostage-takers. In most scenarios, they find themselves in advantageous positions, either financially or through swaps.” Drawing attention to a recent swap involving the world’s largest arms dealer for Brittney Griner, Waltz underlined the troubling pattern that seems to be emerging.</p>

<p>Adding another layer to his criticism, Waltz voiced his concerns regarding the lack of transparency from the current administration. “This is just a horrific deal. Despite being a member of both the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, we are still in the dark about who these Iranians are that Biden’s administration is releasing.”</p>

<p>Decisions involving prisoner swaps are always delicate, with multiple facets to consider. Yet, Waltz’s caution serves as a reminder that, while the immediate resolution of a crisis is paramount, it’s equally essential to consider the long-term implications of such decisions. The well-being and safety of future American citizens overseas might very well depend on the choices made today.</p>
