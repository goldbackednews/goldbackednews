  <p>President Joe Biden, during a recent address at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, made a claim that raised eyebrows. He stated that he was present at Ground Zero in New York City on September 12, 2001, a day after the horrific attacks on the World Trade Centers.</p>

<p>“I remember standing there the next day and looking at the building,” the President recollected. The vivid description he offered was as if “looking through the gates of hell.”</p>

<p>However, records and archival material from that time tell a different story.</p>

<p>On September 12, 2001, Biden, then a U.S. Senator, was with his Senate colleagues and delivered a 10-minute speech addressing the attacks. He was recorded stating, “Some have said, yesterday and today, that all has changed for America… but I pray that is not true … the one thing we cannot allow to change are the values upon which this country is built, for if that were to occur, then they would be able to declare victory.”</p>

<p>Additionally, Biden, in unity with all his Senate colleagues, voted to pass a resolution that officially condemned the acts of terror on that fateful day. It wasn’t until September 20, 2001, that Biden made his first confirmed visit to Ground Zero, joining a group of senators to witness the aftermath of the terror strike.</p>

<p>These inconsistencies have brought Biden’s comments under scrutiny. Furthermore, Biden’s decision to commemorate the 9/11 anniversary in Alaska, instead of at the actual attack sites in New York City, Virginia, or Pennsylvania, has also generated debate.</p>

<p>Given the sensitive nature and the magnitude of the events surrounding 9/11, it remains essential to maintain the accuracy of accounts related to it. As the nation remembers and pays tribute to the lives lost, ensuring a factual retelling of events honors their memory.</p>
