  <p>The road to the 2024 presidential nomination is shaping up to be a contentious one for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. His campaign recently sounded the alarm on what they believe to be an overt attempt by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to stifle his bid against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who is currently steering the Kennedy campaign, recently pointed out that the DNC seems to have established a class of pledged delegates named Party Leaders and Elected Officials (PLEOs). According to Kucinich, these PLEOs bear a striking resemblance to super delegates, given the influence the party has over them. “The repositioning of these delegates puts the DNC in a spot where it could override the popular vote,” Kucinich stated, emphasizing the gravity of potentially ignoring the voice of the masses.</p>

<p>The reordering of state primaries by the DNC, aimed at penalizing states that did not cast their votes in Biden’s favor in the 2020 elections, also came under scrutiny. Kennedy’s campaign has cautioned that such a move could discount the votes of millions, making mail-in voting the only option for many more.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time the DNC has been embroiled in such controversies. Observers can’t help but recall 2016 when there were allegations of the DNC favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Kennedy, sharing his dismay on Fox News, mentioned, “They are even pondering making me foot the bill for the primaries.” He further criticized the DNC’s logic, suggesting they believe there’s no need for a primary when a candidate is already in place.</p>

<p>Biden’s recent reshuffling of the 2024 primary schedule, placing South Carolina at the forefront on Feb. 3, is another significant point of contention. The DNC’s strict guidelines dictate that states not adhering to this altered schedule could face penalties, with a deduction of half their delegates at the national convention.</p>

<p>Kucinich, echoing the sentiments of many, has reached out to DNC Chair Jaime Harrison twice in the past week, seeking a conversation between Kennedy and Harrison. The aim is to emphasize the importance of voter rights and safeguarding the voice of the populace.</p>

<p>Discussing the topic further on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters Prime Time,” Kucinich stated, “Mr. Kennedy’s sole objective is to ensure that every single Democrat vote in the primaries holds weight.” Highlighting the questionable tactics of the DNC, Kucinich expressed fears that even if Kennedy received a significant majority of votes, the DNC’s positioning of extra delegates could still sway the result in Biden’s favor.</p>

<p>Further aggravating the situation, the DNC’s decision to abstain from hosting debates between Democratic candidates has caused alarm. Both Marianne Williamson and Kennedy, the Democrats challenging Biden, have voiced their concerns on this matter.</p>

<p>The unfolding situation puts the spotlight on the DNC’s actions and decisions leading up to the 2024 elections. Only time will tell how this will impact the race and, more importantly, the voters’ faith in the democratic process.</p>
