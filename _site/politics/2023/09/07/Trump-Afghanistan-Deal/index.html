  <p>Amidst the chaos and questions surrounding the Afghanistan withdrawal, 2024 Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump sets the record straight on his stance and the strategy of his administration.</p>

<p>On Wednesday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Trump highlighted the distinctive strength and respect commanded by his administration in comparison to the Biden leadership. He discussed his deal with the Taliban, emphasizing that any violation on their part met with serious consequences.</p>

<p>The former President stated, “So we [had] a step-by-step agreement. They didn’t fulfill certain steps, and therefore, we knocked the hell out of them. We didn’t lose a soldier in 18 months.” This stands in stark contrast to the violence and instability faced by American troops during the Obama administration, where Taliban snipers were a constant threat.</p>

<p>Trump’s remarks point towards the hands-on, no-nonsense approach that his administration adopted. A significant conversation with Taliban leader Abdul underlined this approach, following which the U.S. didn’t lose a single soldier for a year and a half. Trump reiterated, “They had total respect for us. And we were going to get out, but we were going to get out with dignity and strength.”</p>

<p>In drawing this comparison, Trump seems to make a clear distinction between the calculated strategy adopted by his administration and the perceived hastiness and lack of preparedness under Biden. As the 2024 presidential race looms ahead, such reflections provide a glimpse into the leadership styles of the former President, raising important questions about foreign policy strategies and America’s standing on the global stage.</p>
