  <p>Bruce Dubinsky, a seasoned forensic accountant and the first witness in the latest impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, sheds light on what he sees as a deliberate avoidance of facts by the Democrats during the hearings, emphasizing their “misleading” behavior.</p>

<h3 id="dismissing-evidence--a-democratic-strategy">Dismissing Evidence – A Democratic Strategy?</h3>
<p>Dubinsky, with his forty years of experience, stated that Democrats seem to be dismissing the lack of evidence as a reason to sidestep the whole inquiry, deeming the hearings inconclusive. This approach appears to be designed to evade the fundamental aspects of the investigation rather than focusing on gathering the crucial evidence needed to understand the truth behind the accusations against the Bidens.</p>

<h3 id="the-ignored-facts-and-unanswered-questions">The Ignored Facts and Unanswered Questions</h3>
<p>According to Dubinsky, the Democrats’ reluctance to confront the facts presented is a clear indication of their unwillingness to scrutinize the potential misdemeanors of the then Vice President Biden. The Democrats, instead of questioning the purpose behind the monetary transactions and what the funds were used for, are choosing to stay silent and avoid digging deeper into the matter.</p>

<h3 id="the-bidens--a-possible-pay-to-play-scheme">The Bidens – A Possible Pay-to-Play Scheme?</h3>
<p>The reluctance of Democrats to probe further into the transaction raises questions about a possible pay-to-play scheme, where the Bidens are accused of selling access and influence for their benefit. Republicans argue that such transactions seem to be more than mere consulting fees and that the money received by the Bidens needs to be explained.</p>

<p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has announced immediate issuance of subpoenas for the bank records of Hunter and James Biden, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the intricacies of these transactions and the purpose behind them.</p>

<h3 id="a-structured-payment-from-cefc-china-energy">A Structured Payment from CEFC China Energy</h3>
<p>There’s also the lingering matter of the funds received by Biden from CEFC China Energy after he left the Obama White House, which according to Dubinsky seems like a deferred payment. He stated, “If it’s proven that there was intent to structure it that way, that’s a problem certainly.” The investigation needs to determine the legitimacy of such structured payments and the intent behind them.</p>

<h3 id="a-need-for-an-unimpeded-investigation">A Need for an Unimpeded Investigation</h3>
<p>For a thorough understanding of the matter, the investigation should be allowed to proceed without any impediments. Any attempts to hinder the progress of the investigation will only lead to more unanswered questions. Only an unobstructed investigation can open doors to crucial information and determine whether any treasonous violations were committed.</p>

<p>The avoidance and evasion strategy seemingly adopted by the Democrats highlights a concerning reluctance to uncover the truth behind the transactions involving the Bidens. It’s crucial for the sanctity of political processes that all facts are faced and scrutinized meticulously to uphold justice and integrity in political engagements.</p>
