  <p>With the tides of politics swirling, former President Donald Trump steps into the current fray, encouraging the Republican party to use potential government shutdowns as leverage against the policies of the current administration led by President Joe Biden. This confrontation is bringing to light the battle lines drawn within the GOP, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces internal opposition.</p>

<h2 id="fiscal-stalemate">Fiscal Stalemate</h2>
<p>The internal strife within the GOP is marked by fiscal debates, as conservative demands for individual appropriation bills clash with the broader party agenda. Trump’s recent involvement in this dispute emphasizes his enduring influence within the party, as he urges Republicans to “defund all aspects” of what he calls a “weaponized Government” under Biden.</p>

The protracted battle then was over Trump’s sought-after border wall funding, which the Republicans struggled to secure against Democratic opposition.</p>

<h2 id="the-bipartisan-struggle">The Bipartisan Struggle</h2>
<p>To avoid another government shutdown on Oct. 1, both the House and the Democrat-led Senate need to converge on spending legislation acceptable to President Biden.
