  <p>In a revealing statement, former Vice President Mike Pence has confirmed that then-President Donald Trump pressured him to overturn the results of the 2020 election and “reject the vote outright.” This admission further underscores the intense tensions within the Trump administration during its final days.</p>

<p>Speaking candidly, Pence discussed the fraught weeks following the contentious 2020 election, detailing the internal disagreements and external pressures that defined the transition period. The former Vice President noted that while he and Trump have had many shared achievements and moments of camaraderie, their views on the role of the Vice President in the certification process were sharply divergent.</p>

<p>Legal and constitutional experts have long argued that the Vice President does not have the power to unilaterally overturn an election. Pence’s assertion during his interview aligns with this perspective, indicating that he believed his duties were largely ceremonial and that he did not have the authority to change the outcome.</p>

<p>This revelation sheds light on the deep divides within the Trump administration as it grappled with a contested election outcome and growing allegations of voter fraud. The public acknowledgment by Pence is bound to reignite discussions about the legacy of the Trump administration, its commitment to democratic processes, and the role of key players during critical junctures.</p>

<p>As the political landscape continues to evolve, Pence’s statements offer a rare glimpse into the dynamics and deliberations of an administration in crisis, adding another layer to the complex tapestry of American political history.</p>
