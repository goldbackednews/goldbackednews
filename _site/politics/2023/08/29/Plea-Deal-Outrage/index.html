  <p>Anger and frustration are simmering among Republican lawmakers and the families of the 9/11 victims over the Biden administration’s potential plea deal that may let the principal architects of the 9/11 tragedy walk away without facing the death penalty.</p>

<p>Leading the charge against this alleged betrayal are Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.), who have labeled the potential plea deal as “completely unacceptable.” Their joint letter to Secretary of State Lloyd Austin was unambiguous: “Make no mistake, any outcome short of the death penalty for the September 11th plotters would be completely unacceptable.”</p>

<p>But the ramifications of such a deal don’t just lie in political corridors. The heart of the issue touches the wounds of countless American families who lost their loved ones on that fateful day in 2001. Terry Strada, Chair of 9/11 Families United, echoed sentiments of a “betrayal,” while Brett Eagleson, president of Justice 911, labeled the move an “absurd betrayal of justice.”</p>

<p>The Pentagon’s outreach to the victims’ families on August 1 about a potential plea deal, as Fox News Digital and The Associated Press reported, has reignited not just sorrow, but a desperate call for justice. In a heart-wrenching response, more than 2,000 family members of 9/11 victims stated that avoiding a trial would continue to hide crucial information about the 9/11 conspirators from both them and the general public.</p>

<p>One might wonder why such a deal would even be considered? Speculations arise from allegations of torture, including waterboarding, faced by al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay by the CIA. Such accusations have raised legitimate concerns about the potential impact on prosecutors’ cases, further complicating the path to justice.</p>

<p>But, as the National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson clarified, the White House wasn’t part of this decision-making process, signaling no shift in their stance on the issue.</p>

<p>Regardless of the intricacies and legalities, the overarching sentiment remains clear. Justice delayed might very well be justice denied. As we approach the 22nd anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy, the nation and its leaders must ask: What message do we want to send to the world, and more importantly, to the heartbroken families who await justice?</p>
