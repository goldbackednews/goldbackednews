  <p>Former President Donald Trump, never one to shy away from controversy or a public feud, has intensified his criticism of media titan Rupert Murdoch. In a recent video on his Truth Social account, Trump labeled the Fox Corp. chairman as a “globalist,” a term often laden with negative connotations in certain political circles.</p>

<p><strong>Trump vs. Murdoch: A Battle of Titans</strong></p>

<p>While the rift between Trump and Murdoch has been simmering since the 2020 election, it’s now boiling over into the public domain. A pivotal moment in their relationship occurred when Fox News, under Murdoch’s leadership, was the first to announce Arizona’s leaning towards Joe Biden, much earlier than other news agencies. Trump perceives this as part of Murdoch’s broader agenda, which he believes undermines his “America First” doctrine.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Trump didn’t limit his criticism to Murdoch alone. He also took aim at The Wall Street Journal, another media entity owned by Murdoch’s News Corp. In Trump’s view, both Fox News and The Wall Street Journal have strayed from their paths, largely due to Murdoch’s influence.</p>

<p><strong>A Tussle Over the 2024 Republican Nomination</strong></p>

<p>Amidst the infighting, the 2024 Republican nomination is emerging as a battlefield. Trump alleges that Murdoch is promoting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the coveted spot, much to his chagrin. This claim was underscored by Trump’s swipe at DeSantis, whom he referred to as “DeSanctimonious,” hinting at Murdoch’s hand behind previous nominations, like Jeb Bush and even Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>But despite DeSantis’ backing by significant media entities, Trump highlighted his seemingly unassailable lead in the polls. Citing the RealClearPolitics average, Trump boasted a staggering 53.6% to DeSantis’ 13.5%.</p>

<p><strong>Ripples in the Republican Waters</strong></p>

<p>This feud between Trump and Murdoch reveals deeper fissures within the Republican Party. While Trump remains a dominant figure, commanding significant support and influence, the emerging differences suggest a party grappling with its identity in the post-Trump era.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a battle for control over the Republican narrative or a genuine ideological clash, this saga between two influential figures is far from over. As the 2024 elections loom, these fractures could determine the direction the party takes and its prospects in the coming years.</p>

<p>In a climate where media narratives play a pivotal role, the battle lines seem clearly drawn between the former president and a media juggernaut. One thing’s for sure, as Trump concluded in his video, “some people don’t like” the America First vision, but he has no intentions of backing down.</p>
