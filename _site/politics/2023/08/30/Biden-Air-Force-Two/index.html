  <p>Amid rising allegations of potential abuse of public office for personal gain, the House Oversight Committee has initiated a probe into President Joe Biden’s Air Force Two and Marine Two travel records. These records, housed at the National Archives (NARA), are coming under scrutiny for including logs of Joe Biden’s foreign travel accompanied by his family during his tenure as vice president.</p>

<p><strong>Trips Under the Microscope</strong></p>

<p>Between 2009 and mid-2014, Joe Biden, serving as Vice President, embarked on 411 trips across 29 countries, as revealed by the Secret Service logs procured by Judicial Watch. A significant trip that stands out was to Beijing, China, in 2013, masked under the guise of a family vacation. Notably, a mere ten days post this visit, Hunter Biden secured a 10% interest in BHR Partners, a Chinese state-backed investment fund. This fund was co-founded alongside Devon Archer and Chinese equity executive Jonathan Li. Reports even suggest that Joe Biden went to the extent of personally speaking to Li over a speakerphone, essentially to market the Biden “brand.”</p>

<p><strong>Implications of the Beijing Visit</strong></p>

<p>BHR Partners, the fund where Hunter Biden holds a co-founding position with Archer and Li, boasts of investments scaling billions of dollars globally. In a move that attracted attention, in 2017, Devon Archer transferred his stake in BHR Painters to his spouse. Following suit, Hunter Biden transferred his share to his legal representative, Kevin Morris, a fact exclusively disclosed by Breitbart News in April.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns Over Hunter Biden’s Frequent Travels</strong></p>

<p>Breitbart News highlighted in 2021 that Hunter Biden journeyed more than 20 times through Joint Base Andrews. Additionally, Fox News unveiled last week that the younger Biden had visited 15 countries, with his father invariably accompanying him. Such frequent travels, especially to nations with significant business interests, raise eyebrows. The underlying apprehension remains if Joe Biden, in his capacity as Vice President, granted Hunter Biden’s business acquaintances privileged access to Air Force Two. Further, there are doubts if many of these trips had minimal official commitments and were primarily for personal agendas.</p>

<p>House Oversight Committee Chair, James Comer (R-KY), in tandem with Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), expressed these concerns in a letter to the Archives. The lawmakers emphatically stated, “Then-Vice President Biden’s misuse of Air Force Two and Marine Two is indicative of another way in which the President has abused his various offices of public trust and wasted taxpayer money to benefit his family’s enterprise.”</p>

<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The deep-seated allegations and insinuations pose a significant threat to the Biden family’s reputation. The House Republicans remain committed to tracing the money, conducting interviews, and unveiling any underlying corruption. With a deadline set for September 13, 2023, for the Archives to produce the necessary records, the political landscape remains abuzz with anticipation and apprehensions.</p>
