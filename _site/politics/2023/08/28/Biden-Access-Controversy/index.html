  <p>In yet another episode that showcases the opacity shrouding the current administration, the White House was notably non-committal when pressed about allegations of Hunter Biden peddling access to his father, President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Fox News’s relentless correspondent, Peter Doocy, took White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to task during Monday’s press briefing. Doocy sought clarity on whether the White House is “confident” that Hunter Biden has ceased selling access to President Biden. Instead of a direct answer, Jean-Pierre frustratingly deflected, suggesting the question was more appropriate for Hunter Biden’s representatives.</p>

<p>The evasion continued as Doocy rightly argued that if someone appeared to be trading access to the White House, then surely the question was valid for its representatives. Jean-Pierre’s response was an unyielding and rather vague, “I’m just not going to get into this.”</p>

<p>Devon Archer, a close business ally of Hunter Biden, recently divulged some telling insights to House investigators. He revealed that the younger Biden frequently brought then-Vice President Joe Biden into conversations with business partners via speakerphone to ostensibly “sell the brand.” Archer’s admissions to Tucker Carlson further highlighted the brazenness of these dealings, emphasizing the allure and influence the “Biden brand” commanded when Joe Biden held the vice-presidential office.</p>

<p>But when Jean-Pierre was questioned about what exactly the “Biden brand” signified, she again deftly sidestepped the inquiry, leaving more questions than answers.</p>

<p>A recent Yahoo News/YouGov survey has unveiled startling figures that underscore growing public skepticism. A staggering 73% of voters suspect Hunter Biden engaged in illicit activities, and 45% believe Joe Biden personally benefited from the family’s business dealings.</p>

<p>Given the mounting evidence and persistent doubts among voters, the administration’s choice to remain evasive only amplifies concerns. The electorate deserves transparency, especially when such serious allegations loom large. Yet, as the Democrats seemingly stonewall, the public’s faith in the administration’s integrity risks being eroded further.</p>
