  </div><article class="article-content">
  <p>In a closed-door testimony held in April, former President Donald Trump staunchly defended his business empire while touting his accomplishments during his presidency. The deposition, released recently, showcased Trump’s fiery defense against the New York attorney general’s fraud allegations and his assertion that he played a pivotal role in averting nuclear conflicts.</p>

<p>Facing off against Attorney General Letitia James, Trump expressed his dismay at being sued over claims made in his financial statements regarding the valuation of his properties. He deemed the lawsuit a “terrible thing” and remarked that it was regrettable that he had to justify himself.</p>

<p>The released transcript, spanning a staggering 479 pages, unveiled Trump’s assertions that his real estate company was financially robust. He vehemently dismissed James’ claims that he had inflated his net worth by as much as 39% in some years. Despite this legal battle, Trump remained confident in his business’s standing and the value of his assets.</p>

<p>Trump’s testimonial focus wasn’t limited to his business endeavors; he also took the opportunity to highlight his accomplishments during his tenure as President. He described the role of the presidency as the “most important job in the world,” emphasizing his strong stance on China, his efforts to prevent Russian aggression in Ukraine, and his successful deterrence of North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>Regarding North Korea, Trump testified, “I think you would have nuclear holocaust if I didn’t deal with North Korea. I think you would have a nuclear war if I weren’t elected. And I think you might have a nuclear war now, if you want to know the truth.”</p>

<p>The released transcript has sparked anticipation ahead of a September 22 hearing before Judge Arthur Engoron, where aspects of the case could potentially be resolved before the scheduled October trial. Attorney General Letitia James is striving for summary judgment, aiming to establish that Trump and his company deceived various parties by misrepresenting their financials.</p>

<p>The lawsuit hinges on two key questions: whether Trump’s financial statements were false or misleading, and whether these statements were utilized in business transactions. James and her legal team assert that both questions warrant a resounding “yes” based on the extensive evidence they’ve gathered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Trump’s legal team is fervently seeking the dismissal of the case, asserting that many claims are barred by the statute of limitations and questioning James’ standing to sue. Regardless of the outcome of the fraud claim, Engoron will preside over a non-jury trial for the remaining claims if they are not settled.</p>

<p>As the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the upcoming presidential election, Trump has repeatedly decried the lawsuit as a politically motivated effort by his opponents to tarnish his reputation. This legal battle is just one of several that Trump is currently facing, underscoring the complex landscape of his potential return to the White House.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the recently released deposition transcript provides a window into Donald Trump’s unwavering defense of his business empire and his legacy as a former President. The legal battle against the New York attorney general’s fraud allegations has not deterred Trump’s confidence in his financial standing, nor has it dimmed his conviction in the impact he had on international relations during his presidency. As legal proceedings unfold, all eyes will remain on the courtroom, awaiting Judge Engoron’s decision and the potential implications for both Trump’s business reputation and his political aspirations.</p>
