  <p>During a recent CNN segment, anchor Jake Tapper voiced concerns over the appointment of U.S. attorney David Weiss as special counsel for the Hunter Biden investigation. While Republicans have been openly skeptical about Weiss overseeing the probe, Tapper’s comments marked a departure from the typical media narrative, suggesting that some GOP concerns “have merit.”</p>

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss, the federal prosecutor who previously faced criticism for a “sweetheart” plea deal for Hunter Biden that subsequently fell through under close examination. This move grants Weiss greater authority regarding the pressing of charges.</p>

<p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., labeled Garland’s decision as a likely attempt by the Justice Department to orchestrate a “coverup” of the Biden family’s purported financial dealings with foreign entities. Tapper shared similar concerns, questioning the rationale behind Weiss’s special counsel designation.</p>

<p>“It is odd,” Tapper remarked, noting that a special counsel is typically an external appointment. While acknowledging that such an internal appointment has precedent, Tapper wondered aloud why the Department of Justice would retain Weiss after the dissolution of the initial plea deal for Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>Further, Tapper highlighted inconsistencies in Weiss’s assertions about his jurisdictional power, especially concerning charges outside of Delaware. Whistleblowers have claimed that Weiss conveyed differing narratives in public versus private settings regarding his reach. The recent special counsel appointment appears to validate these whistleblower concerns.</p>

<p>“The Justice Department and Weiss denied what the whistleblowers were saying, but this move makes it seem as though, well, maybe the whistleblowers were right,” Tapper opined.</p>

<p>The broader Hunter Biden investigation has also been shrouded in controversy. In a prior interview, Tapper had labeled the financial ties between Hunter Biden and overseas entities as “sleazy,” albeit not necessarily criminal. However, he repeatedly underscored that there seemed to be “no evidence” that President Biden had engaged in any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In that same interview, Comer outlined multiple obstructions faced by the investigation, alleging non-cooperation from various agencies, including the DOJ, FBI, and IRS. Whistleblower testimonies, especially from the IRS, indicated possible directive interference in the probe.</p>

<p>As the Hunter Biden investigation progresses under Weiss’s direction, both sides of the political spectrum will be observing closely, searching for any indications of bias or compromise in the process.</p>
