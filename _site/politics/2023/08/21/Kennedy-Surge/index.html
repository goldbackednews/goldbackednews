  <p>Amid the buzzing political landscape of South Carolina, a fresh face emerges as a prominent contender among Democrat voters - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Recent polls indicate a considerable uptick in his support among the likely Democrat primary voters in this crucial state, once instrumental in bolstering President Joe Biden’s campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Kennedy’s Climbing Numbers</strong></p>

<p>A recent poll sponsored by the American Values 2024 SuperPAC (which supports Kennedy) and conducted by John Zogby Strategies unveiled Kennedy Jr.’s impressive leap. Garnering a 24% approval rate among the likely primary voters, Kennedy is positioning himself as a significant contender.</p>

<p>Further details from the poll show that in a theoretical three-way race, Biden still maintains a lead with 55% as opposed to Kennedy’s 24%. Marianne Williamson lags behind at 5%, and a significant 16% remain undecided. However, when it narrows down to a direct contest between Biden and Kennedy, Biden’s edge shrinks to a mere 10 points.</p>

<p><strong>Key Issues Tipping the Scale?</strong></p>

<p>One notable factor that might be playing into Kennedy’s favor is his vocal opposition to the stringent coronavirus measures that were enacted during the height of the pandemic. The poll highlighted that half of the likely voters in the South Carolina primary felt that the coronavirus lockdowns had a catastrophic impact, leading to the permanent shutdown of numerous small businesses. This had a disproportionately adverse effect on the African American community.</p>

<p>Kennedy’s campaign appears to be sensing the momentum, marked by his aggressive campaigning in the state. By this week, he will have completed six visits to South Carolina. Contrasting this, the superPAC statement pointed out President Biden’s limited visibility in the state, marked by a solitary visit earlier in July.</p>

<p>As the political season intensifies, RFK Jr.’s surge in South Carolina might very well be a precursor to a broader national trend. The next few weeks will be pivotal in shaping the Democratic landscape ahead of the primaries.</p>
