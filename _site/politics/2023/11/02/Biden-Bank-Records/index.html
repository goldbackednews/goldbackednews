  <p>In an eye-opening episode of ‘Jesse Watters Primetime’, the popular FOX News host meticulously unraveled the intricate financial web surrounding President Biden, raising severe concerns about the alleged money laundering schemes that seem to trace back directly to China. Jesse Watters, known for his sharp analysis and no-holds-barred commentary, left no stone unturned as he dissected the money trail, bringing to light the unsettling connections that many have long suspected but were never able to conclusively prove.</p>

<p>For years, whispers and speculations have circulated around President Biden’s financial dealings, particularly regarding his ties to China. However, it seemed as if Biden believed he could simply run out the clock, evading the need to disclose his bank records, and with them, the truth. But as Watters pointed out, in today’s digital age, accessing bank records is a far cry from the tedious process of rummaging through physical files. With a simple account number, the truth can be printed out in black and white, laid bare for all to see.</p>

<p>Representative James Comer has been at the forefront of this investigation, diligently working to uncover the facts and follow the money straight to the source. And it seems his efforts are finally bearing fruit. Despite the left’s persistent claims of innocence and lack of evidence, the Biden family bank records are beginning to tell a different story.</p>

<p>At the heart of this controversy is a $40,000 check made out directly to Joe Biden. While the left continues to insist that there is no incriminating evidence against the President, this check raises a multitude of questions. The funds can be traced back to China, as uncovered by Rep. Comer. The money trail is convoluted, yet undeniable: China wired $5 million to Hunter Biden’s company, which then sent $400,000 to Hunter, and subsequently, money was sent to Biden’s brother, finally culminating in a $40,000 check to Biden himself.</p>

<p>Breaking down the numbers, a startling realization comes to light: $40,000 is precisely 10% of $400,000. Watters aptly coined this the ‘10% for “The Big Guy”’ scenario, drawing a direct line between the money from China and Biden’s bank account. This revelation raises the stakes significantly, challenging the Democrats’ narrative and forcing the question: What does a smoking gun look like in the face of such compelling evidence?</p>

<p>As the country watches closely, the Biden money saga continues to unfold. Watters’ exposé has brought to light the uncomfortable truths and unanswered questions that linger around President Biden’s financial dealings, making it clear that this story is far from over. The call for transparency and accountability has never been louder, as Americans from coast to coast demand answers. It’s time to follow the money, and the trail does not lie.</p>
