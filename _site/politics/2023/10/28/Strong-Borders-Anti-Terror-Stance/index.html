  <p>In a bold statement Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., underscored the paramount importance of enforcing stringent border security measures and maintaining a relentless stance against terrorism within the halls of Congress.</p>

<p>Carter was unequivocal in his message: “Look, if you have ties to terrorist organizations or if you support terrorist organizations, there’s no place for you in the United States Congress, and you don’t need to be there.”</p>

<p>The timely conversation comes in the wake of a resounding vote by the House to express steadfast support for Israel and to denounce Hamas in the strongest terms. With a vote tally of 412 in favor, 10 opposed, and 6 abstaining, the resolution was overwhelmingly supported by lawmakers.</p>

<p>The resolution firmly positions the House alongside Israel in its defense against “the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists,” affirming Israel’s right to defend itself. Moreover, it delivers a sharp rebuke to Hamas, calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the release of hostages.</p>

<p>Carter did not mince words in expressing his disappointment with the 10 members who chose not to back the resolution. He emphasized the near-unanimity of support, stating, “I’m very, very disappointed that these people who did not support this; this is obvious. It was overwhelming with only just a few of them who didn’t. … If you support terrorism, if you have ties to terrorism, there’s no place for you in the United States.”</p>

<p>Addressing the issue of border security, Carter drew a direct connection to national security, expressing alarm at the ease with which individuals are currently able to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. He highlighted the potential for terrorists to exploit this vulnerability, stating, “Oh, no question about it. Listen, that is a porous border. I mean, people are crossing that; and we would be naive to think that they’re not terrorists who are coming across that border with the intention of hurting us.”</p>

<p>He reinforced the idea that the primary responsibility of the federal government is to protect American soil, a task he believes can only be accomplished through robust and secure borders.</p>

<p>Carter did not hold back in his critique of the current administration’s approach to border security, asserting, “This administration is just ridiculous in what they’re doing right now. They are not doing anything at all to protect us, and we’re just welcoming in people who truly do want to hurt us.”</p>

<p>He concluded with a call to action, underscoring the urgency of strengthening our borders to ensure the safety and security of the United States.</p>
