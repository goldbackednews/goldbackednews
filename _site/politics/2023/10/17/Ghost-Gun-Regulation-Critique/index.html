  <p>In what some view as an alarming overreach, the Supreme Court has dictated that two internet-based gun part vendors comply with a regulation championed by the Biden administration, targeting so-called ‘ghost guns’. These firearms, which lack serial numbers, have been portrayed by some as a looming threat, despite arguments from advocates about the importance of individual freedom and rights.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the court, by a narrow margin of 5-4, opted to maintain the regulation after it had been sensibly negated by a lower-tier court. This recent verdict is made even more contentious given that no justice offered public dissent on Monday’s directive. This ruling, however, contradicts the decision of a federal Texas judge who rightfully exempted Blackhawk Manufacturing Group and Defense Distributed from this arguably intrusive regulation.</p>

<p>Hoping to justify this expansion of government oversight, the Biden administration communicated to the Supreme Court that other gun part producers were in line seeking similar legal protections.</p>

<p>Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, in a somewhat fear-mongering tone, cautioned, “Without this Court’s interference, ghost guns would be accessible to anyone with a computer and a credit card, completely bypassing the need for a background check.”</p>

<p>In a dramatic regulatory shift, the Biden administration has broadened the definition of a firearm to include even unfinished parts, like a frame or a receiver. This move ostensibly aims for easier tracking, but in effect, burdens manufacturers and possibly infringes upon Second Amendment rights. These parts now need licensing and serial numbers, adding layers of bureaucracy to a once straightforward process. The rule also mandates background checks prior to any sale, equating these parts with commercial firearms – a false equivalence for many.</p>

<p>This regulation, alarmingly, doesn’t limit its reach, encapsulating all means of firearm production, including those from individual parts, kits, or even 3D printers.</p>

<p>While this overreaching regulation remains active, the Biden administration plans to challenge the Texas judge’s decision at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Many anticipate, with bated breath, the potential for this divisive issue to echo once again within the walls of the Supreme Court.</p>
