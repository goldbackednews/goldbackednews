  <p>In a fervent address, former President Donald Trump expressed his strong disapproval of California’s recent “sanctuary law” for children undergoing transgender-related medical treatments without parental consent. Trump, eyeing a return to the Oval Office in 2024, pledged to use federal laws, including those against child abuse and kidnapping, to counteract this state legislation.</p>

<p>California’s controversial law allows children to travel to the state for transgender-related procedures even if their parents from other states oppose it. Describing the legislation as a “horrific scheme,” Trump asserted that it permits “barbaric and irreversible” treatments that infringe upon parental rights.</p>

<p>“It’s sick,” said the 45th president, emphasizing the disbelief many share about the existence of such a law. Trump described the act of overriding parents’ rights as a sterilization of children. “The state of California has no right to take your children away from parents and to sterilize them, which is exactly what they’re doing,” Trump stressed.</p>

<p>Further elaborating on his stance, Trump promised that if reelected, he would address the issue on his first day in office. “Upon my inauguration, we will aggressively challenge these perverted California laws that strip parents of their rights and that encourage minors to be transported across state lines for sexual mutilation purposes,” he voiced with a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>Throughout his address, Trump reiterated his commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of the nation’s youth. “I will protect your youth. I will protect your children. I will protect the right of parents to make decisions on behalf of their children,” he passionately declared.</p>

<p>Expressing a broader concern for the nation’s trajectory, Trump concluded by saying, “We’re in a failing nation. This nation is failing. We’re not going to let it fail any longer. We’re going to make America great again.”</p>

<p>The evolving dialogue and growing acceptance of transgenderism and “non-binary” concepts have raised eyebrows, especially concerning the youth. Recent studies indicate that social contagion may play a role in younger generations identifying as transgender. Disturbing reports, such as the one indicating that over 600 underage girls underwent breast removal in Canada for transgender purposes, further fuel the debate around this sensitive issue.</p>
