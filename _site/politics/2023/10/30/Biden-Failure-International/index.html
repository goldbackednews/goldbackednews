  <p>In a no-holds-barred critique, Rep. Rob Estes, a Kansas Republican, took President Joe Biden to task for what he views as a series of critical failures in international relations, tying them directly to a trifecta of global crises. Estes, in his candid conversation on Newsmax’s “Saturday Agenda,” did not mince words, painting a picture of an administration fraught with weakness and a lack of strategic foresight.</p>

<p>The Afghanistan debacle stands as a glaring testament to Biden’s incapacity to lead, according to Estes. The chaotic withdrawal, he argues, broadcasted a message of vulnerability that reverberated across the globe, emboldening the likes of Russia and Iran, and resulting in devastating humanitarian crises.</p>

<p>“Biden’s mismanagement in Afghanistan was a clear signal to world leaders like Putin that the U.S. was retreating from its position of strength,” Estes declared, connecting the dots between the administration’s blunders and the emboldened stance of adversarial nations. He underscored the severity of these blunders, pointing out the direct line between Biden’s failures and the atrocities unfolding before the world.</p>

<p>Estes’ criticism extended beyond the international arena, as he also tackled the dysfunction evident in domestic politics. He described the election of Speaker Mike Johnson as a “messy process,” a symptom of the broader disarray within the government. Despite acknowledging Johnson’s commitment to doing the right thing, Estes could not help but highlight the ways in which the administration’s failures have permeated every level of governance.</p>

<p>In his call to action, Estes underscored the dire need for strong, decisive leadership, the kind that seems to be sorely lacking in the current administration. He pinpointed inflation, government overspending, border insecurity, and the need to stand with Israel as pressing issues that require immediate and unwavering attention.</p>

<p>For conservative readers and those frustrated with the direction in which the country is headed, Estes’ words resonate deeply. His critique of Biden is not just a denunciation of past actions; it is a rallying cry for a return to strength, accountability, and principled leadership. The Biden administration’s failures on the world stage are not just abstract policies gone awry; they are, as Estes highlights, a direct threat to American security and global stability.</p>
