  <p>New York Republican House members are rallying to potentially expel Rep. George Santos (R-NY) from Congress, making it one of the rarest occurrences in U.S. political history. CNN’s Manu Raju reported on “News Central” that the Republicans believe they are on the verge of securing the two-thirds majority required for expulsion, with a vote expected to take place later this week.</p>

<p>The United States House of Representatives has only witnessed the expulsion of five members throughout its existence, highlighting the gravity of this situation. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) expressed a strong sentiment outside the Capitol, stating, “We’re getting two thirds. There seems to be a good sentiment out there that enough is enough.” He emphasized the disappointment and frustration with Santos, citing his fraudulent activities and manipulation of donors over the past year or longer.</p>

<p>Rep. Marcus Molinaro (R-NY) also voiced his concerns, asserting that it is “absolutely inappropriate” for Santos to continue serving in his position. He highlighted the bipartisan support for this move, acknowledging some hesitance but underlining the clear case against Santos and his deceitful actions to attain his current office.</p>

<p>Despite the growing momentum, Speaker Johnson has expressed his lack of support for the expulsion effort, noting that Santos has not been convicted yet. Raju also pointed out that two censure resolutions are on the table, one against Rashida Tlaib and another against Marjorie Taylor Greene. However, there is opposition against both measures, and their future remains uncertain. Johnson himself conveyed his disapproval of the tit-for-tat censure resolutions during a private conference call.</p>

<p>As this political drama unfolds in the days ahead, the nation’s eyes are fixed on Congress, waiting to see if history will be made with the expulsion of George Santos. The situation not only reflects the internal workings of the Republican Party but also underscores the broader issues of trust, accountability, and integrity within the political realm.</p>
