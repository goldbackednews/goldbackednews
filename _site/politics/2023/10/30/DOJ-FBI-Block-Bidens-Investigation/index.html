  <p>Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds has accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI of repeatedly obstructing federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania from conducting investigations into President Joe Biden and his family. During a recent appearance on “Newsline,” Donalds disclosed that the House Judiciary Committee had received testimony indicating that these federal agencies had interfered in probes related to the Biden family’s business dealings at least 10 times.</p>

<p>The intervention apparently came from high-ranking officials situated at the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the main Department of Justice office. This startling information raises questions about the transparency and impartiality of these esteemed federal institutions, casting a shadow over their operations.</p>

<p>Donalds further highlighted a specific instance involving a check from President Biden’s brother, James, amounting to a $200,000 loan repayment to the President himself. This financial transaction, according to Donalds, establishes a direct link between President Biden and the business transactions executed by James Biden and Hunter Biden with foreign entities.</p>

<p>The Florida Representative emphasized the importance of scrutinizing James Biden’s involvement in these dealings, asserting that the public’s focus should extend beyond Hunter Biden. He raised concerns regarding the absence of written loan agreements between the President and his brother, suggesting that this could be indicative of tax evasion practices.</p>

<p>Rep. Donalds assured that the investigation into these matters would persist, with a commitment to holding the administration accountable. “Our investigation is going to continue. We’re going to get to the bottom of this and hold this administration accountable,” he affirmed.</p>

<p>In response to these allegations, the White House and the DOJ have been on the defensive. The White House has dismissed the committee’s efforts as a mere distraction tactic by “Extreme House Republicans,” accusing them of attempting to shift attention away from their own governance failures and impending government shutdown.</p>

<p>They criticized the hearing as a circus filled with disinformation, aimed solely at undermining President Biden and his family. The White House maintains that the real crisis lies with the House Republicans’ chaotic governance, for which they should bear the responsibility.</p>

<p>This developing story brings to light serious allegations against federal agencies, necessitating a thorough and unbiased investigation to ensure accountability and uphold the integrity of the American justice system.</p>
