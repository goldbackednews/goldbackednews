  <p>Former Vice President and current Republican presidential candidate, Mike Pence, shared his perspective on how former President Donald Trump’s actions surrounding the 2020 election should be judged. His stance? Leave it to the voters.</p>

<p>In a Newsmax town hall held in Iowa, Pence conveyed his belief that decisions concerning Trump’s alleged interference in the 2020 election results should be determined by the voters and not the courts.</p>

<p>The subject is deeply personal for Pence, as he recalled the events of January 6, 2021, a day he labeled a “tragic day”. On this date, Pence oversaw the Congress’ certification of the Electoral College, during which the Capitol Building experienced a breach by protesters. Speaking on the event, Pence expressed, “By God’s grace, I did my duty that day under the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p>However, Pence’s stance on the handling of Trump’s fate is distinct from the general political discourse. He voiced his hope that “issues around the president’s conduct and actions on that day and leading up to that day would be left to the judgment of the American people and not be brought into the courts of this country.”</p>

<p>This comes amidst Trump facing legal repercussions, with a four-count indictment in Washington, D.C., and a 13-count indictment in Georgia. Both relate to his alleged endeavors to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

<p>The relationship between Trump and Pence has shown signs of strain, primarily due to differences in their recounting of events on January 6th. Pence maintains that Trump had urged him to reverse the voters’ decision, while Trump insists that he simply wanted a delay in certification to further investigate claims of voter fraud.</p>

<p>Discussing his past relationship with Trump, Pence stated, “We haven’t talked in a while, but we used to talk and work together every day for the better part of five years in a campaign and in our administration.”</p>

<p>Despite the palpable tension and the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, Pence maintains his belief that voters, and not legal systems, should be the final arbiters. He concluded, “I’d like to see these issues resolved by voters, by the American people.”</p>
