  <p>In a surprising turn of events, President Joe Biden’s scheduled summit with Arab leaders was abruptly cancelled due to escalating conflict in the Israel-Hamas warfront. The move followed a tragic explosion at a Gaza hospital, claiming hundreds of lives.</p>

<p>The White House announced that Biden would now only be visiting Israel, putting off his anticipated trip to Jordan. Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had previously pulled out from the summit, condemning the attacks which the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza attributed to an Israeli airstrike. However, the Israeli military denied any involvement, pointing to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause.</p>

<p>Jordan’s response was unequivocal. Their foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, expressed deep concerns on a state-run network about the ongoing war and aggression, pushing the region towards a precipice. He emphasized that Jordan would consider hosting the summit only when all involved parties are on the same page, primarily focusing on halting the war, respecting Palestinian humanity, and delivering deserved aid.</p>

<p>This situation underscores a mounting challenge for President Biden. As the leader of a superpower nation, the eyes of the world watch his every move. In a region fraught with tensions, Biden’s decision to personally visit showcases his commitment to a central role for the U.S. on the global stage, banking on personal diplomacy as a decisive instrument.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Biden’s approach, Jon Alterman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies remarked, “This is how Joe Biden believes politics works and history is made.”</p>

<p>However, with the humanitarian crisis escalating, concerns are mounting over the potential expansion of the conflict beyond Gaza’s borders. Already there have been encounters on Israel’s northern frontier with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed faction stationed in Southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>President Biden’s journey to the region is fraught with potential pitfalls. Other U.S. officials’ visits have been disrupted due to rocket attacks into Israel. Further Israeli airstrikes in Gaza could intensify global condemnation just as Biden aims to fortify ties with a key ally.</p>

<p>The U.S. has subtly been amplifying its call for humanitarian assistance in Gaza amidst ongoing support for Israel. This dual stance arises from fears of worsening conditions in Gaza, leading to diminished Arab tolerance for Israel’s military actions. Such a scenario could significantly bolster Hamas and even inspire Iran to escalate its anti-Israel endeavors, potentially igniting a broader regional conflict.</p>

<p>In a bid to bring relief, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been working diligently with both Arab and Israeli leadership. His recent efforts resulted in an agreement outlining a strategy for humanitarian aid distribution in Gaza.</p>

<p>Amidst these global dynamics, Biden remains steadfast in his commitment to allies. When asked about the simultaneous crises in Israel and Ukraine on CBS’ “60 Minutes”, he resolutely stated, “We’re the United States of America…We have the capacity to do this and we have an obligation to.”</p>

<p>In the upcoming days, Biden is set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other key officials. However, meetings with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas have been shelved.</p>

<p>As the Israel-Palestinian conflict endures, the global community anxiously awaits the next steps from world leaders, with hopes for peace and stability in the region.</p>
