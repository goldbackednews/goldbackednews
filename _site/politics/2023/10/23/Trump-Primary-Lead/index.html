  <p>Former President Donald Trump has not just maintained but significantly bolstered his leading position, boasting a double-digit increase in support since June. This comes amidst a series of legal challenges and his conspicuous absence from the initial two GOP primary debates. In contrast, his primary rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is facing a downward spiral, losing support rapidly, according to the latest data from a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.</p>

<p>The survey paints a clear picture: Trump has successfully captivated the majority of Republican voters, with 58 percent throwing their weight behind him, marking a robust ten-point climb since June. DeSantis, on the other hand, finds himself lagging substantially, trailing by a staggering 46 points at 12 percent support — a sharp 11-point decrease from his 23 percent standing in June.</p>

<p>Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is closely tailing DeSantis, holding 11 percent of the support, and displaying a positive trajectory with a seven-point leap since June.</p>

<p>The poll, conducted between October 17-20 with a sample of 1,000 registered voters, comes with a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.</p>

<p>DeSantis, undeterred, is pressing on with his comprehensive tour of Iowa’s counties, aiming to bolster his presence in this crucial early voting state set to cast its votes on January 15. However, the RealClearPolitics average of polls indicates that DeSantis is up against a tough challenge, trailing Trump in Iowa by an average of 33 percent.</p>

<p>This development adds to the pressure on DeSantis, who has been on the receiving end of Trump’s sharp critique. Trump recently remarked on DeSantis’s dwindling poll numbers, labeling them as that of a “wounded bird falling from the sky” and prognosticating DeSantis’s imminent exit from the race due to financial constraints.</p>

<p>Trump’s statement, “After having single handily gotten him elected Governor, with no thanks or glory, it has been a beautiful thing to watch,” adds a layer of personal animosity to the political rivalry, setting the stage for an intense and unpredictable GOP primary race. As the political landscape continues to evolve, all eyes remain on these two dominant figures, eagerly awaiting the next development in this high-stakes political drama.</p>
