  <p>In what many critics describe as a questionable move, President Joe Biden’s decision to resume hefty financial support to Palestinian entities is now under judicial scrutiny. U.S. District Court Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk has stepped in to grant a much-needed review, prompted by concerns that Biden’s generosity may be in stark violation of established anti-terrorism laws.</p>

<p>This legal review comes on the heels of a lawsuit initiated by Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, and the America First Legal Foundation (AFL). Their shared contention is that the Biden administration may be carelessly allowing Economic Support Funds, meant for humanitarian purposes, to be misused. Such funds, instead of uplifting the Palestinian people, could be financing terrorist activities in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p>Biden’s decision to rekindle financial relations with the Palestinian National Authority stands in sharp contrast to the more cautious approach of his predecessor. Former President Donald Trump had prudently halted any payments, heeding the Taylor Force Act of 2018, which clearly restricts U.S. financial assistance to Palestine while it continues supporting imprisoned terrorists and their dependents.</p>

<p>At the heart of the issue is a staggering sum of approximately $500 million greenlit by Biden, representing a lion’s share of the total U.S. aid to Palestine. And as if to add fuel to the fire, an additional $700 million was routed to a UN agency in the region — an agency Trump had wisely exited.</p>

<p>The gravity of this decision becomes even more palpable against the backdrop of the recent devastating terrorist attacks on Israel, attributed to Hamas and Hezbollah. Both groups, as The Wall Street Journal points out, are under the financial and operational umbrella of Iran.</p>

<p>The human toll of these conflicts is alarming: Israel mourns the loss of over 1,200 souls, with another 3,400 nursing injuries and more than 200 held hostage. Palestinian sources too paint a grim picture with over 1,100 dead, 5,400 wounded, and a startling 263,000 individuals displaced, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>The Washington Free Beacon has also unearthed unsettling findings. Despite being armed with internal reports suggesting that such funding might embolden Hamas, the Biden administration moved forward, seemingly undeterred.</p>

<p>As the judicial review progresses, many hope it brings clarity to the situation. However, Biden’s decision to potentially put U.S. funds in the hands of extremist groups, directly or indirectly, is a matter that will undoubtedly cast a long shadow over his presidency.</p>
