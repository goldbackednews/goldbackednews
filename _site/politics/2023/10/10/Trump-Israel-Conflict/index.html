  <p>WOLFEBORO, N.H. – At a crucial campaign stop in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump levied strong criticisms against President Joe Biden regarding the recent deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas. Trump is of the firm belief that such atrocities in Israel would never have occurred had he still been in office.</p>

<p>Trump, who is seeking the presidency for the third consecutive time, emphasized that under his leadership, peace in the Middle East was maintained, specifically citing the Abraham Accords. Drawing a clear line between the peace of his term and the current unrest, Trump stated, “Today we have an all-out war in Israel, and it’s going to spread very quickly. What a difference a president makes.”</p>

<p>A significant point of contention in Trump’s speech was a recent move by the Biden administration involving a $6 billion transfer to Iran. This move, aimed at releasing five detained U.S. citizens, involved the transfer of frozen Iranian assets from South Korea to an account in Doha, Qatar. Republicans, including Trump, argue that this deal inadvertently provided resources that aided Hamas’ assault on Israel.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has emphasized its unwavering support for Israel in these trying times. President Biden remarked that the U.S. stands firmly with the people of Israel and will ensure the nation has the resources to defend itself. Despite these assurances, the central criticism from the Republican side remains fixated on the financial transfer to Iran, seeing it as a misstep that indirectly fueled the conflict.</p>

<p>Trump further elaborated on his administration’s tough stance on Iran, highlighting how he reduced the Iranian economy, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and imposed sanctions. In a bid to keep America safe, he also initiated strict travel bans targeting radical Islamic terrorists.</p>

<p>His commitment to Israel was clear as he vowed, “As president, I will once again stand strongly with the state of Israel, and we will cut off the money to the terrorists on day one.”</p>

<p>Despite the criticism from Trump and other Republicans, the Biden administration continues to assert its firm support for Israel’s right to defend itself, with many in the administration condemning the actions of Hamas.</p>

<p>The political landscape is certainly heating up as the 2024 presidential race approaches, and Trump’s campaign stops are likely to be a focal point of interest in the lead-up to the election.</p>
