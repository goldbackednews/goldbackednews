  <p>In a highly anticipated move, federal prosecutors are set to appear for transcribed interviews at the House Judiciary Committee this week, as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged political bias in the Hunter Biden probe. This closed-door session raises significant questions about the integrity of the investigation and the role of politics in judicial proceedings.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, Martin Estrada, is scheduled to be interviewed on Tuesday, followed by DOJ Tax Division attorney Stuart Goldberg on Wednesday. These interviews are a response to allegations of politicization and misconduct at the Justice Department agencies throughout the years-long investigation into President Joe Biden’s son.</p>

<p>The move comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has been pushing for months to have federal prosecutors involved in the Biden investigation testify before his committee. These negotiations have been fraught, reflecting the high stakes and political tensions surrounding the investigation.</p>

<p>Special Counsel David Weiss, overseeing the government’s investigation into Biden, is also expected to appear for a transcribed interview on Nov. 7, behind closed doors. The Justice Department had initially offered Weiss for public testimony back in July, indicating a preference for transparency, but this closed-door session suggests a more confidential approach is being taken.</p>

<p>The allegations that politics have influenced or hampered prosecutorial decisions in the investigation have led to heightened scrutiny, with Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, taking on the role of special counsel. He has been leading the Biden investigation since 2018, and his appointment as special counsel aims to address concerns about the impartiality of the investigation.</p>

<p>In his first move as special counsel, Weiss charged Hunter Biden with making false statements related to a firearm purchase and possession of a firearm by a person using controlled substances. Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the investigation continues.</p>

<p>This development comes amid House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry against President Biden, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape. The status of this inquiry remains uncertain following the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker.</p>

<p>As the political drama unfolds, the nation’s eyes are on the House Judiciary Committee and the closed-door interviews set to take place this week. The outcomes of these interviews may have significant implications for the Hunter Biden investigation, the integrity of the judicial process, and the broader political discourse in the United States.</p>
