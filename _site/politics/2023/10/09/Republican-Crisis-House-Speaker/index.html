  <p>As Israel grapples with a massive surprise attack by Hamas militants, House Republicans back home are facing their own battle: the unexpected ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the ensuing leadership vacuum.</p>

<p>Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., didn’t hold back, taking to social media to vent his frustration: “This is why you don’t remove a Speaker mid-term without cause. What an unmitigated s— show.” Lawler underscored the need for stability and direction, especially given the escalating situation in Israel. He emphasized, “We need to elect a Speaker.”</p>

<p>In the face of adversity, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has displayed determination, vowing to eliminate threats posed by Hamas. “All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding, and operating in that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble,” Netanyahu warned.</p>

<p>Yet, in stark contrast, the political landscape within the U.S. House of Representatives is marked by uncertainty and disarray. For the first time in U.S. history, a House Speaker has been removed, paralyzing Congress’s decision-making abilities during a pivotal international crisis.</p>

<p>House Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has taken the reins as interim speaker, but his true extent of power remains uncertain. Traditionally, the Speaker is a key part of the “Gang of Eight”, a select group of top congressional leaders privy to classified intelligence briefings. Without a definitive Speaker, there’s a possible intelligence gap during this delicate period.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy raised similar concerns in a recent interview, “There is nothing the House can do until they elect a speaker… why would you ever remove a speaker during a term to raise doubt around the world?”</p>

<p>As the search for a new leader intensifies, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have emerged as frontrunners. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who previously contemplated running, urged the party to swiftly come together, emphasizing the urgency of the situation, “We cannot allow the narrative to be chaos and confusion on Capitol Hill.”</p>

<p>Rep. Marc Molinaro echoed the sentiments, emphasizing the immediate need for a permanent speaker. “Israel is at war [and] its people are being terrorized. We cannot let uncertainty in the Capitol get in the way of helping Israel. There’s no time to waste,” he asserted.</p>

<p>House Republicans are expected to make a decisive move in the coming days, with speaker elections scheduled for Wednesday, following pivotal meetings early in the week. As the world watches the Israeli conflict unfold, the pressure is on for House Republicans to unite, lead, and address the pressing matters at hand.</p>
