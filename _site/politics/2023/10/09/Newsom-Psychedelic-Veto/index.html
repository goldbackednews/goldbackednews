  <p>In a bold move, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation intended to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms and other hallucinogens, sparking mixed reactions across the state and country.</p>

<p>While the proposed bill had aimed to decriminalize the possession and personal use of these substances for adults over 21, Newsom expressed reservations. His stance is surprising, especially given his supportive history toward cannabis legalization back in 2016.</p>

<p>The bill, designed to take effect in 2025, emphasized the non-commercial nature of decriminalization. It would have only applied to personal use, excluding the selling of these substances, and would’ve ensured that individuals possessing limited amounts of such hallucinogens would not face prosecution or arrest.</p>

<p>Newsom, in his official statement, conveyed the need for regulated treatment guidelines, ensuring therapeutic and safety standards before such a move. The legislation’s objective also included instructing the California Health and Human Services Agency to delve deeper into the therapeutic use of psychedelics and provide insights to lawmakers.</p>

<p>With psychedelics gaining momentum as potential treatment options for various mental health conditions, it’s a hot topic. For instance, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) recognized psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy for treatment-resistant depression as recently as 2019.</p>

<p>Many proponents, including combat veterans and emergency responders, tout the benefits of psychedelics for trauma treatment. Joe McKay, a firefighter who worked during the devastating 9/11 attacks, is an example, having publicly expressed how psilocybin transformed his life.</p>

<p>However, not everyone is on board. Concerns range from the potential ease of access for younger individuals to the currently uncharted benefits and risks of these substances. The California Coalition for Psychedelic Safety and Education, which opposed the bill, emphasized the need for more safety measures.</p>

<p>State Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill’s author, expressed disappointment in the veto, advocating for the numerous Californians who’ve found solace in these substances. Wiener emphasized the evident drawbacks of criminalizing such substances and hinted at revisiting the topic with future legislation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, other states and cities have shown progressive stances on this issue. Oregon and Colorado have made strides toward decriminalizing psychedelics, and cities like Oakland and San Francisco in California have already decriminalized certain natural psychedelics.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how this veto will shape the future of psychedelic decriminalization in California. With potential ballot initiatives slated for 2024, Californians may get another shot at making their voices heard on this divisive issue.</p>
