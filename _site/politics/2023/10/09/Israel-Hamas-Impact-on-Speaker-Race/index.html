  <p>The recent brutal Hamas attack on Israel has ignited an unexpected wrinkle in the already-tense race for the US House Speaker position. This international crisis, which has many looking to the US for a response, comes at a time when Republicans are pressing for a prompt installment of a new leader to address these global challenges.</p>

<p>With the House of Representatives currently missing a Speaker, it’s been hamstrung in its ability to swiftly tackle the situation, even as the crisis escalates. This gap in leadership has been acutely felt, given that President Joe Biden has not sought a formal request from Congress and the Senate remains in recess.</p>

<p>Despite the urgency, the White House has remained relatively quiet on the issue. Monday morning saw a lid called, meaning no public comments from President Biden until at least Tuesday.</p>

<p>Acting with limited authority is Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry (R-NC), whose role is based on rules established post 9/11. However, his recent actions suggest a readiness to stretch these powers, evidenced by his recent eviction of Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Steny Hoyer (R-MD) from prime Capitol office space.</p>

<p>The absence of a solid leader has led to a legislative standstill. While House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and ranking Democrat Gregory Meeks (D-NY) have drafted a pro-Israel resolution, real legislative actions remain stagnant. This standstill is even more pronounced when considering that some members of the political sphere, like members of the Squad, have been vocally critical of the US-Israel relationship.</p>

<p>There is also a keen awareness among Republicans about the missed political opportunities this presents. Without clear leadership, they’re unable to effectively address divisive issues within their own ranks or capitalize on differences among Democrats.</p>

<p>As the situation in Israel becomes more volatile, it’s evident that both parties are feeling the heat to move quickly. Potential contenders for the Speaker position include Reps. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Jim Jordan (R-OH). With the next potential Speaker vote expected as early as Thursday, Republicans are under pressure to choose their candidate wisely.</p>

<p>As political maneuvers continue, there’s a looming need to address other urgent matters, including funding decisions with the November 17 deadline approaching. With the ousting of McCarthy, these timelines are under scrutiny.</p>

<p>In essence, the sudden Hamas-Israel crisis has added another layer of complexity to an already heated political atmosphere in the US. If a decision isn’t reached promptly about the Speaker’s position, and the global situation continues to worsen, Republicans might need to resort to unconventional measures.</p>
