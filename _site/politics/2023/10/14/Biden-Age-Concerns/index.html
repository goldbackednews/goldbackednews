  <p>As President Joe Biden’s term unfolds, a growing chorus of concerns has emerged from the Democratic ranks, as recent polling suggests a majority of voters perceive him as “old, slowing down,” and even “feeble.” These worries are further fueled by the President’s age, which stands at 80, leading to skepticism about his ability to seek another term.</p>

<p>The polling data, which paint a picture of an aging President, is reportedly causing unease among Democrats. The spotlight on Biden’s age is further intensified by focus groups, where swing voters frequently label him using terms like “old, slowing down”, or more critically as having “dementia” or being “feeble”.</p>

<p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) recently voiced the need for the Democratic Party to address these growing apprehensions, especially with the looming possibility of a rematch against former President Donald Trump. Another vocal Senator, Jon Tester (D-MT), highlighted the undeniable reality of Biden’s age, pointing out that he would be 82 during the next election.</p>

<p>As party members grapple with this data, there’s an overarching sentiment that President Biden hasn’t done enough to challenge these perceptions. Politico’s insights suggest that the President has shown little interest in countering the negative image that’s slowly being cemented in the public’s view.</p>

<p>Adding to concerns are Biden’s physical health issues. Though he suffers from atrial fibrillation, peripheral neuropathy in his feet, and hyperlipidemia, his physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, after a physical examination in February, confirmed that the President is fit to conduct presidential duties.</p>

<p>However, Politico’s Jonathan Martin notes certain limitations in Biden’s interactions with the media, which has a cascading effect on his public perception. Instead of directly addressing questions about the economy and public sentiment, Biden often digresses, losing potential opportunities to challenge his opponents.</p>

<p>Amidst these age-related concerns, some Republicans suggest that focusing on Biden’s mental or physical capacity isn’t a fruitful strategy for the upcoming elections. They believe the spotlight should be on Biden’s policy decisions.</p>

<p>Poll results emphasize the President’s challenges, revealing approval ratings below 50% across critical issues such as inflation, immigration, crime, terrorism, and foreign affairs. With such figures in play, it’s evident that the coming months will be crucial for Biden and the Democratic Party as they strategize for the 2024 elections.</p>
