  <p>In a decisive move against what many term as “woke” language, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas is introducing an executive order that mandates the use of gender-specific language, specifically when addressing women. This act emerges as a strong stand against the increasing trend of adopting gender-neutral terms in governmental communication.</p>

<p>“The science is clear and real; There are things only women can do, like perform the miracle of birth,” Sanders expressed in the executive order. She emphasized that government documentation should “celebrate gender distinctions between men and women — not erase them.”</p>

<p>This order is primarily a reaction to the nation-wide effort to adopt what is dubbed as “culturally conscious” or “inclusive” language. Such changes frequently attempt to remove traditional gender associations from words. One specific instance this spring showcased the Arkansas Department of Health describing potential negative effects on “pregnant people.” Sanders’ order will now necessitate the usage of the terms “pregnant women” or “pregnant mom.”</p>

<p>The executive order further clarifies the preferred language for other scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of “menstruating person” or “menstruating people”, use “woman” or “women.”</li>
  <li>Rather than “birthing person”, the term should be “birth mom.”</li>
  <li>“Chestfeeding” should be replaced with “breastfeeding.”</li>
  <li>Instead of “laboring person,” use “birth mom,” and “woman” in place of “birth-giver.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Sanders, who holds the distinction of being the first female governor of Arkansas, has been consistently vocal against the removal of feminine associations from terms traditionally used for women. She notably criticized President Biden, stating that he became “the first man to surrender his presidency to a woke mob that can’t tell you what a woman is.”</p>

<p>The trend of adjusting gender-specific terms is not unique to Arkansas. For instance, Portland, Oregon, recently encouraged its city staff to embrace a more “culturally conscious” vocabulary. This adjustment included avoiding the use of words like “women,” “Caucasian,” and “citizen.” Similarly, educational institutions across the nation are adapting their curriculums to mirror this trend.</p>

<p>Sanders, however, is determined to push back against these changes, voicing her concerns at the executive order’s signing ceremony. She is expected to state, “Enough trying to erase women and girls. Enough denying our biological differences from men.”</p>

<p>This bold step by Gov. Sanders is sure to spark extensive debate both in Arkansas and across the nation. With tensions rising over the balance between tradition and inclusivity, this executive order may serve as a tipping point in the ongoing discourse about “woke” language in America.</p>
