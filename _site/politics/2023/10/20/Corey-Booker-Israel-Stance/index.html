  <p>The recent attacks in Israel and the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have brought renewed focus on U.S. political leaders and their positions concerning the region. Among those under the lens is Senator Cory Booker, a notable figure who has, in the past, shown a special connection to Israel. But his controversial decision regarding the Iran Nuclear Deal has raised eyebrows and led to questions about his real stance on the U.S.-Israel relationship.</p>

<p>In 2015, Cory Booker supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more commonly referred to as the Iran Deal. This move, which provided Iran with access to $150 billion and legitimized their nuclear program, was seen by many as a significant risk, with fears that the funds could indirectly support groups antagonistic to Israel. Critics argue that the deal, rather than ensuring peace, could inadvertently bolster enemies of Israel, such as the militant group, Hamas.</p>

<p>Booker’s decision to support the JCPOA came as a surprise to many who saw him as a staunch supporter of Israel. His bond with the nation was evident during numerous visits, including his initial trip, arranged by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach in 1994. The Rabbi recalls their close relationship, forged over decades, with a shared love for Israel at its center.</p>

<p>Yet, the choice to back the JCPOA seemed to eclipse this connection, leading to a public fallout between Booker and Rabbi Boteach. The Rabbi even held a press conference alongside then-Governor Chris Christie, decrying Booker’s decision as aiding global terror.</p>

<p>Recent events in Israel, particularly the horrors of the October 7th massacre, have intensified the scrutiny on Booker. While President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials traveled to Israel in a show of solidarity, Booker’s hasty departure from the country during this crisis further fueled criticisms of his commitment.</p>

<p>Contrasting Booker’s reaction to the events in Israel with the responses of other U.S. officials, such as Senator Joni Ernst and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, underscores the dichotomy. While these leaders showed solidarity by visiting the nation during its time of need, Booker’s abrupt exit left many questioning his allegiance.</p>

<p>This episode has also unearthed older political decisions, like Booker’s relationship with Senator Robert Menendez. Despite once testifying to Menendez’s character during a corruption trial, Booker later called for his resignation upon Menendez’s indictment by the FBI on other charges. Critics argue that Booker’s political decisions often seem influenced more by personal ambition than moral conviction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Senator Cory Booker’s actions concerning Israel and the JCPOA continue to spark debates. While his history with Israel is deeply rooted, his more recent decisions paint a complex picture, leaving many to ponder the true nature of his stance on U.S.-Israel relations.</p>
