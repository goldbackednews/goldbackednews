  <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump, now leading in the Republican presidential primary, has promised to overturn President Joe Biden’s Electric Vehicle (EV) mandates. Additionally, Trump has cautioned American auto workers about a looming job crisis, predicting their roles will become redundant in just two years if the current policies continue.</p>

<p>Breitbart News has reported on the escalating situation where approximately 34,000 auto workers from companies like General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis are striking across the United States. These workers are striving to negotiate new contracts that would guarantee better wages amidst soaring inflation and job security assurances against the backdrop of Biden’s EV mandates.</p>

<p>In a video message targeting the United Auto Workers (UAW), Trump expressed his intent to abolish Biden’s EV mandates, which he believes would endanger their jobs in the near future.</p>

<p>“If you’re an auto worker, be it in UAW or any other state, the future seems bleak. With the current trajectory, many of you might not have jobs in two years. I intend to rejuvenate the auto industry in our country, much like the golden days,” Trump emphasized.</p>

<p>The former President further advised union leaders to reconsider their political affiliations, warning that siding with the Democrats might result in the downfall of the auto industry. He added, “No matter your hourly wage, the reality is, without a job, it doesn’t matter. I aim to restore the prosperity of the auto industry and the workers behind it.”</p>

<p>Car prices have surged, which Trump attributes to Biden’s policies. He stated, “Since my term ended, car prices have skyrocketed by nearly 30%, with the average new car price reaching a staggering $50,000. This isn’t just an attack on the automobile industry; it’s an attack on the American dream.”</p>

<p>Trump criticized Biden’s EV mandates for pushing car companies to elevate prices and eventually phasing out their more affordable gas-powered models. As a result, consumers are being nudged towards the pricier electric models. If companies resist this change, they could face hefty fines amounting to hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>Many in the auto industry view Biden’s EV mandates as a potential cost-saving strategy, which could indirectly boost executive salaries. Furthermore, thanks to Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), auto executives are on track to benefit from billions in tax credits, further promoting EV production and sales.</p>

<p>Trump’s strong stance on this matter highlights the ongoing debate about the trajectory of the American auto industry and the potential ramifications for workers and consumers alike.</p>
