  <p>In an unexpected twist of digital diplomacy, Truth Social, the brainchild of former President Donald Trump, has rolled out the welcome mat for none other than its founder’s 2024 rival, President Joe Biden. The Biden-Harris HQ campaign account made its debut on the platform with a cheeky post: “Well. Let’s see how this goes. Converts welcome!”.</p>

<p>This embrace of the platform by Biden’s reelection campaign has caught the eyes of political enthusiasts and analysts alike. It raises questions about the balance of power in the digital realm, as political heavyweights look to engage and influence potential voters on varying platforms.</p>

<p>Devin Nunes, former Rep. and now CEO of Trump Media and Technology Group, voiced his perspective on Newsmax’s “The Chris Salcedo Show”. “We’re a free speech platform,” Nunes declared, distinguishing Truth Social from social media giants like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. “We welcome anyone and everyone. Contrary to perhaps popular belief, we aren’t looking to ban or kick off the Biden campaign.”</p>

<p>By the end of the week, Biden-Harris HQ’s follower count stood at an impressive 33,600 - surpassing even the follower count of the Team Trump account. However, Trump’s primary account remains a juggernaut with a whopping 6.45 million followers.</p>

<p>Nunes took a jibe at media outlets, calling them out for spinning narratives about Biden’s follower count. He mused over the idea of Biden potentially overtaking Trump on Truth Social, remarking, “If that happens, great for him. But most of those following Biden are likely doing so to engage with his campaign, often critically.”</p>

<p>Nunes alluded to the swathes of comments under Biden’s posts that seem to be real-time fact-checking the president’s campaign, a testament to the interactive and unfiltered nature of the platform.</p>

<p>As the 2024 election season heats up, the use of platforms like Truth Social offers an uncharted territory for campaigns to navigate. With both major parties marking their territory on the platform, it’s clear that the battle for the White House will be fought as fiercely online as off.</p>

<p>In today’s digital age, where a tweet can sway public opinion and a post can ignite a debate, platforms like Truth Social are more than just social networks. They are political battlegrounds, and the game has just begun.</p>
