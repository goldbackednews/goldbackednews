  <p>WILMINGTON, DE - A legal cloud continues to hang over the first family as Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, firmly declared his innocence in a Delaware court on Tuesday. Facing federal gun charges resulting from Special Counsel David Weiss’ prolonged investigation, Biden entered a not guilty plea.</p>

<p>The charges brought against him are weighty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making a false statement during a firearm purchase.</li>
  <li>Providing inaccurate information mandatory for a federal firearms licensed dealer.</li>
  <li>Possession of a firearm as someone unlawfully using or addicted to controlled substances.</li>
</ul>

<p>A collective total of potential 25 years in prison looms over Biden if convicted on all counts, alongside a hefty fine of $250,000 for each charge and the possibility of three years under supervised release.</p>

<p>Despite the severity of the charges, Biden maintains his innocence. Magistrate Judge Christopher Burke, who oversaw the arraignment, has set specific conditions for Biden’s release. These include seeking employment, transparency about international travel plans, abstinence from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and mandatory participation in a drug counseling program. Notably, Biden passed a drug test during the hearing, addressing concerns about potential substance misuse.</p>

<p>Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s defense attorney, disclosed plans to file a motion to dismiss based on a diversion agreement related to the gun charges, asserting its continued validity. This agreement was initially part of a plea deal to address misdemeanor tax counts, which disintegrated in July. As a result, Biden had no choice but to plead not guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and a felony gun charge.</p>

<p>This recent appearance in court revolves around allegations from 2018. The indictment claims that Biden, while acquiring a Colt Cobra 38SPL Revolver, dishonestly asserted on Form 4473 that he wasn’t unlawfully using or addicted to any narcotic or controlled substance, a statement the authorities contend was false.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors Leo Wise and Derek Hines represented the government at the hearing, while Weiss was absent. Previous reports suggest that Hunter Biden’s firearm became a matter of public concern when it was discarded in a trash can near a Delaware school in 2018.</p>

<p>Although the defense appears ready to challenge the charges on several fronts, including the validity and constitutionality of the implicated statutes, it’s evident that this legal battle is just heating up. As the story develops, its impact on the Biden family and the wider political landscape remains to be seen.</p>
