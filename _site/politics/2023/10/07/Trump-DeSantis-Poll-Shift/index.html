  <p>In the ever-evolving political landscape, former President Donald Trump’s popularity seems to remain resilient. Recent polling data reveals Trump’s lead over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has surged by a staggering 20 points nationally in just over two months.</p>

<p>This dramatic shift was highlighted by a recent poll published on Wednesday, showcasing Trump’s support among registered Republicans and independents who lean Republican at 56%. This marks a 10-point increase from July’s Marquette poll, which pegged him at 46%.</p>

<p>On the flip side, DeSantis experienced a drop in support, losing ten points since July. The Florida Governor now garners only 12% of the support, indicating a significant shift in the political landscape within the Republican camp.</p>

<p>The New York Times further highlighted DeSantis’s challenges, noting the campaign’s decision to relocate a third of its staff to Iowa and its current financial status. DeSantis’s campaign war chest for GOP primary purposes stands at a concerning $5 million.</p>

<p>The Republican field remains diverse, with Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, not far behind DeSantis at six percent. Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, and former Vice President Mike Pence share fourth place, each holding four percent of the support. Interestingly, Ramaswamy witnessed a three-point increase from July, while Pence saw a three percent decrease.</p>

<p>In this political poll mix, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) also made appearances, holding two percent and one percent support, respectively.</p>

<p>Marquette University provided further food for thought by examining a hypothetical election match-up between Trump and current President Joe Biden. Results fluctuated based on the voter sample. Among registered voters, Trump led by a slight margin, while Biden had a minuscule advantage among likely voters. Both scenarios present statistical ties, keeping the political waters murky.</p>

<p>With these developments, it’s evident that the political tides are shifting, re-establishing Trump’s dominance within the Republican sphere and placing DeSantis on unsure footing. As the Republican race heats up, the nation watches closely, anticipating the next move in this intricate political chess game.</p>
