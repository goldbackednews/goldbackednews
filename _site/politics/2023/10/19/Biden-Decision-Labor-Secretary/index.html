  <p>The Biden administration faces growing criticism after its decision to include Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su in the presidential line of succession. This move has sparked significant backlash, particularly as Su’s nomination for the role has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Alabama GOP Sen. Katie Britt spearheaded a letter, signed by 29 Republican Senate colleagues, addressed to President Biden. The letter voices their “grave concerns” and seeks clarification about Su’s eligibility to potentially assume the office of the President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.</p>

<p>The senators highlighted that since March 14, 2023, Ms. Su’s nomination has not been confirmed, pointing out a lack of bipartisan support for her position. The White House, however, continues to recognize her as Acting Secretary of Labor and has included her name on its official website in the “order of succession to the Presidency.”</p>

<p>Su, who served as California’s labor secretary from 2019 to 2021 under Gov. Gavin Newsom, is currently ninth in line for the presidency. The GOP senators have called out the administration for potentially disregarding congressional intent, stating it would be “antithetical to our system of governance.”</p>

<p>The senators’ concerns also touch on the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress the authority to set the presidential line of succession beyond the Vice President. The letter further emphasizes that Ms. Su has not been “appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,” urging the administration to clarify its stance on her position in the line of succession.</p>

<p>In a direct quote from the letter, the senators wrote, “It is unimaginable to think that this Administration believes someone who has neither been duly elected nor confirmed by the Senate… could be President of the United States.”</p>

<p>Besides the ongoing controversy surrounding her place in the line of succession, Su’s nomination has faced considerable challenges from both sides of the aisle. While she has been serving as acting secretary since Marty Walsh’s resignation earlier this year, her official confirmation remains uncertain. Su’s nomination saw intense pushback due to her stance on gig work regulations in California and her perceived lack of cooperation with ICE officials during her tenure as the state’s top labor official.</p>

<p>The GOP senators have reiterated their call for President Biden to reconsider Su’s nomination, suggesting he put forward a nominee capable of garnering bipartisan support.</p>

<p>With both parties voicing concerns over Su’s nomination, this situation serves as another flashpoint in the already tense relationship between the Biden administration and Senate Republicans. The resolution to this debate will likely have significant implications for the administration’s relations with Congress and its ability to navigate future political challenges.</p>
