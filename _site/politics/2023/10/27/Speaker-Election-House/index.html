  <p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has publicly accused former Speaker hopeful Kevin McCarthy of sabotaging the election process for the House Speaker position, alleging that McCarthy’s machinations delayed the appointment of Mike Johnson, R-La., to the speakership. Gaetz’s comments add a dramatic chapter to the already intense race for one of the most significant positions in American politics.</p>

<p>Just a month after Gaetz played a crucial role in McCarthy’s ousting, the Florida Congressman has shifted the spotlight back onto McCarthy, accusing him of being a “saboteur” and blaming him for the delay in electing a House Speaker. According to Gaetz, McCarthy undermined the candidacies of Reps. Steve Scalise, R-La., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Tom Emmer, R-Minn., ultimately prolonging the process and creating turmoil within the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The eventual election of Mike Johnson as House Speaker marked the end of a tumultuous period for the Republicans, but Gaetz insists that the delay could have been avoided. He alleges that McCarthy actively worked against his fellow Republicans, hindering their chances of securing the speakership. “What Tom Emmer, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan all saw was that the actual saboteur of their candidacies was Kevin McCarthy,” Gaetz declared, casting a shadow of doubt over McCarthy’s actions during the election.</p>

<p>Interestingly, former President Donald Trump weighed in on the matter, taking credit for derailing Emmer’s candidacy and stating bluntly, “I killed him.” McCarthy, for his part, publicly supported Jordan, referring to him as a “great ally” during the three floor votes. However, Gaetz remains adamant that McCarthy’s intentions were not as straightforward as they seemed.</p>

<p>According to Gaetz, McCarthy’s true colors were revealed during a closed-door GOP conference meeting, where freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., proposed polling the Republicans on Johnson’s candidacy. “Kevin McCarthy objected,” Gaetz stated, “Because at that point he hadn’t figured out a way yet how to scuttle Mike Johnson the way he scuttled Tom Emmer, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan before.”</p>

<p>Gaetz concluded his accusations by contrasting Johnson with McCarthy, painting Johnson as a leader free from obligations to lobbyists and special interests, while suggesting that McCarthy was indebted to these groups. “Mike Johnson answers to God and the Constitution,” Gaetz proclaimed, firmly placing his support behind the new Speaker.</p>

<p>As the dust settles on this high-stakes political showdown, questions linger about the true dynamics of the Speaker election and the role McCarthy played in it. Gaetz’s accusations have undoubtedly added a layer of intrigue to the proceedings, casting a long shadow over McCarthy’s actions and intentions during this critical period in American politics.</p>
