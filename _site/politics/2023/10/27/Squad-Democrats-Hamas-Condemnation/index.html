  <p>The political atmosphere in Congress took a tense turn as a group of House Democrats, predominantly from the far-left “Squad,” voted against a resolution condemning the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists. The resolution, H.R. 771, which also reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for Israel, witnessed overwhelming bipartisan approval but faced resistance from these members, sparking outrage and condemnation.</p>

<p>Republican Representative Jason Smith of Missouri did not hold back his criticisms, lambasting the “Squad” members and other Democrats for their refusal to back the resolution. Speaking on “The Brian Kilmeade Show,” Smith labeled their actions as a “complete disgrace” and questioned their fitness to serve in Congress.</p>

<p>“Those nine Democrats are a complete disgrace,” Smith remarked vehemently. He pointed out that Cori Bush, a member of the “Squad” from his home state, has advocated for defunding the police while representing a city that, per capita, experiences more murders than any other in the United States. Smith argued that these members are irrational, accusing them of wishing to destroy society and of promoting propaganda that is as misleading as possible. He emphasized, “The fact that they’re harboring and supporting terrorists who have killed more Jewish people since the Holocaust is absolutely unacceptable and these people do not deserve to serve in the halls of Congress.”</p>

<p>The 10 members who voted against the resolution included six of the eight “Squad” members: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Jamaal Bowman of New York, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, and Cori Bush of Missouri. They were joined by André Carson of Indiana, Al Green of Texas, and Delia Ramirez of Illinois.</p>

<p>On the other side, two “Squad” members, Greg Casar of Texas and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, chose to vote present, alongside Joaquin Castro of Texas, Nydia Velázquez of New York, Jesús “Chuy” Garcia of Illinois, and Pramila Jayapal of Washington.</p>

<p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky also voted against the resolution, but he explicitly condemned the Hamas attack and affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself, unlike some members of the “Squad.”</p>

<p>The resolution’s passage with an overwhelming majority of 412-10, despite the notable dissenting votes, sends a clear message of America’s solidarity with Israel. However, the “Squad” members’ refusal to condemn Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, has ignited a fiery debate about their stance on Israel and their commitment to combating terrorism, placing them under intense scrutiny and criticism.</p>
