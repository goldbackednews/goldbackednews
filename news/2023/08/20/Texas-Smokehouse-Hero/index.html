  <p>In a dramatic turn of events at Woody’s Smokehouse in Centerville, Texas, a legally armed good Samaritan stepped in, potentially saving lives.</p>

<p>On August 14, just after midday, the Leon County Sheriff’s Office was alerted to gunshots at Woody’s Smokehouse. Preliminary reports and subsequent investigation by the authorities have revealed that Kevin Craig Anderson entered the popular barbecue joint in what was described as a “harassing manner.” Hailing from Houston, Anderson reportedly began to agitate several patrons within the restaurant.</p>

<p>The situation took a violent turn when Anderson proceeded to assault an elderly gentleman inside the bathroom, knocking him unconscious on the floor tiles. Even as the victim lay defenseless, the assault continued.</p>

<p>But intervention was close at hand. Another patron of the smokehouse, a man licensed to carry a firearm, attempted to halt Anderson’s violent onslaught. The aggressor quickly shifted his focus to the armed individual, knocking him to the ground and launching a fresh assault.</p>

<p>In the heat of the moment, and presumably in self-defense, the armed man discharged two shots, hitting Anderson in his right arm. The injured suspect then fled the scene in his car. Not long after, officers located Anderson in his vehicle on the side of a nearby highway. He was airlifted to a local hospital for immediate medical attention.</p>

<p>As of now, both the sheriff’s department and the Texas Rangers are collaborating on the ongoing investigation into this harrowing incident.</p>
