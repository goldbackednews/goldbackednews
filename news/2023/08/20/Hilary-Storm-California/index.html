  <p>Amid an already eventful year, Californians face another unprecedented challenge: Tropical Storm Hilary. Weakened from its previous hurricane status, Hilary is still poised to unleash significant damage and has prompted urgent preparations across the state.</p>

<p>Initially a Category 1 hurricane, Hilary lost some strength as it veered towards Mexico’s coast and the Baja California peninsula. However, the National Weather Service (NWS) warns that the storm remains a threat, with potential for “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding across the region, especially in California.</p>

<p>Though no longer a hurricane, the storm’s rainfall is deemed its primary hazard. Regions in southern California, including Los Angeles, have already begun experiencing increased rainfall. The storm’s center is forecasted to shift northwards from Baja California into southern California within the next day.</p>

<p>National Hurricane Center Director, Dr. Michael Brennan, expressed deep concern about potential flash flooding and catastrophic consequences, especially in desert regions between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Hilary’s current position, approximately 220 miles south-southeast of San Diego, continues to threaten Mexican cities such as Ensenada and Tijuana. Despite its weakened state, experts stress that Hilary remains treacherous.</p>

<p>The storm has already claimed a life. In Santa Rosalia, Mexico, one individual was swept away by strong currents in an overflowing stream. Rescue efforts managed to save four others.</p>

<p>For Southern California, Hilary represents a historical event. The storm is set to be the first tropical storm to make landfall in the region since 1939. This impending landfall has prompted evacuation advisories, particularly for Santa Catalina Island.</p>

<p>In anticipation, California Governor Gavin Newsom has enacted an emergency declaration. Approximately 7,500 personnel have been mobilized across southern California, including California Highway Patrol members and Caltran workers. They aim to respond effectively to anticipated flash floods, lightning, and even tornadoes.</p>

<p>Tijuana, positioned directly in the storm’s trajectory, has taken significant precautions. Beaches have been closed, storm shelters established, and citizens advised on the dangers of landslides, especially those living in precarious hillside homes.</p>

<p>Mexico has further responded by evacuating individuals from vulnerable islands off the Baja coast and deploying troops for emergency operations. The storm’s treacherous conditions prompted the closing of beaches even in the picturesque La Paz.</p>

<p>In a race against time, Los Angeles authorities are relocating homeless individuals to shelters. State beaches in San Diego and Orange counties have also been closed. As a precaution, regions have exhausted supplies of free sandbags and residents are rushing to stockpile essentials. To ensure the safety of visitors, both Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve have been temporarily closed.</p>

<p>Major League Baseball and SpaceX have made adjustments to their schedules, with games being moved and rocket launches postponed.</p>

<p>As Hilary continues its path, Californians brace for what could be one of the most challenging storms in nearly a century.</p>
