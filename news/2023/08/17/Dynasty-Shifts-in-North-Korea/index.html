  <p>In a surprising move that is shifting political tides in North Korea, the nation’s present dictator, Kim Jong Un, has begun adopting the political title “Great President.” This title is not just any designation but is historically ascribed solely to his grandfather, the revered founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung.</p>

<h3 id="an-eternal-title-reclaimed">An Eternal Title Reclaimed?</h3>

<p>North Korean media outlets have amplified the use of the “Great President” title in reference to Kim Jong Un. Over the past seven months, they have mentioned him with this title approximately 26 times, an increase from previous years. Such a move draws attention, especially considering the official status of the title.</p>

<p>In 1998, an amendment to the national constitution solidified Kim Il Sung’s position as the “eternal president,” even abolishing the office to ensure that no successor could claim the title. The verbatim reference in the constitution reads: “Under the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Korean people will hold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-sung in high esteem as the eternal President of the Republic.”</p>

<h3 id="dynasty-and-deference">Dynasty and Deference</h3>

<p>Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, despite his authoritative stance, never reached for the title of “Great President.” This is presumed to be out of respect for his father, Kim Il Sung. Instead, upon his passing in 2012, Kim Jong Il was immortalized in the constitution as “the eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.”</p>

<p>However, as the media’s terminology indicates, Kim Jong Un seems less bound by traditional deference. His gradual increase in using the title — from just four times in 2020, to 16 in 2021, and a whopping 24 times in 2022 — showcases his intent to further centralize power and perhaps rewrite established protocols.</p>

<h3 id="the-dynastys-god-like-aura">The Dynasty’s God-like Aura</h3>

<p>The Kim dynasty, since North Korea’s inception in 1948, has carefully cultivated a secular religion around their leadership. This unique blend of governance, combined with the communist philosophy of “juche,” vests virtually all authority in the “supreme leader.” Through state media and strategic communications, the Kims have been portrayed as near-deities, credited with extraordinary intellect and a myriad of talents.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un’s move to embrace the “Great President” title is more than a mere semantic shift. It’s a testament to the ever-evolving political theater of North Korea, where tradition and modern ambitions intertwine in the quest for power.</p>
