  <p>Germany is under scrutiny for allegedly using accounting tricks to meet its NATO defense obligations, according to a recent report. The claim adds a new dimension to ongoing debates about member nations’ commitments to the transatlantic alliance.</p>

<p>The report alleges that Germany, the largest economy in Europe, has been employing clever bookkeeping maneuvers to inflate its defense budget and meet the NATO guideline of spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense.</p>

<p>Critics argue that such practices could undermine the collective defense principle that underpins NATO, if countries appear to be meeting their obligations on paper but not in practice. The 2% guideline, although not a hard rule, has been a contentious issue among NATO members, with the U.S. repeatedly urging other members to increase their defense spending.</p>

<p>The German government has not responded directly to the allegations but has reaffirmed its commitment to NATO. The country has previously faced criticism for not meeting the 2% spending guideline, a trend common among several NATO member states.</p>

<p>The allegations have fueled further debate on NATO members’ commitment to their defense spending obligations, which is likely to be a critical issue at upcoming alliance meetings.</p>
