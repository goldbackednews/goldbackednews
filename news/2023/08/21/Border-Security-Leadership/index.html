  <p>EAGLE PASS, Texas - The Lone Star state witnessed an unparalleled show of unity and bipartisan governance on Monday. Texas Governor Greg Abbott was joined by Governors Kim Reynolds (Iowa), Jim Pillen (Nebraska), Kevin Stitt (Oklahoma), and Kristi Noem (South Dakota) for a detailed tour of one of the nation’s most active border regions. Their collective presence underscored the widespread concerns surrounding the border crisis and the need for effective state leadership in the absence of adequate federal action.</p>

<p>During a press briefing post-tour, Governor Abbott extolled the cooperative efforts of various states to mitigate migrant crossings and curtail Mexican cartel activities. “Twenty-five states, which amounts to half of the states in the United States of America, are stepping up to secure a border that President Biden has seemingly abandoned,” Abbott proclaimed. This remarkable commitment indicates a significant portion of the country acknowledges the urgency of border security.</p>

<p>Governor Noem, in particular, did not mince words about the severity of the situation. Describing her experience during the tour, she said, “What I saw today is a war zone.” Noem, referring to the alarming cartel activities in the region, emphasized, “This truly is a war for our country, our federal laws, and sovereignty.”</p>

<p>While Governor Abbott’s Operation Lone Star and its related security measures, including the floating border barrier system, have been controversial, they reflect a state’s dedication to protecting its residents. Despite ongoing litigation from the United States Department of Justice over the floating barriers, Texas has already allocated over $4.5 billion towards law enforcement and military deployments for enhanced border security.</p>

<p>As the federal government’s response remains uncertain, Texas, along with its sister states, has chosen to step up and provide the leadership and resources necessary to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. As this multi-state effort continues, it serves as a testament to the dedication and commitment of these governors to prioritize the well-being of their residents above political differences.</p>
