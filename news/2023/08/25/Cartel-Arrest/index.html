  <p>In a significant development, Mexican state police officers have successfully arrested Jose “El Amarillo” Leyva, a shadowy cartel figure responsible for multiple terror-style attacks in the border state of Nuevo Leon. This elusive cartel operator became widely recognized after Breitbart Texas released his photograph and specific details in 2021.</p>

<p>Aged 57, El Amarillo was associated with the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas. He had been commanding several squads of armed men in northern Nuevo Leon, with their primary targets being police forces and rival gang members. The apprehension of El Amarillo was a collaborative effort by Nuevo Leon’s Fuerza Civil Police, leveraging intelligence and initial investigations conducted by the State Investigations Agency (AEI). During the arrest, the police also confiscated a weapon and a small drug stash.</p>

<p>Breitbart Texas had shed light on El Amarillo’s ominous activities in 2021. He had masterminded and executed various strike missions that targeted local police officers in northern Nuevo Leon. One of the most heinous crimes tied to El Amarillo and his henchmen was the 2021 assassination of the local police chief in Dr. Coss, Francisco Leonides Cruz. Breitbart Texas had detailed the chilling episode where the police chief was ambushed and taken down in a calculated surprise attack.</p>

<p>Since that report, El Amarillo expanded his sphere of influence, and his footprints were evident in numerous terror-themed assaults on both police and civilians in the Nuevo Leon-Tamaulipas region.</p>

<p>Breitbart Texas’s sources in law enforcement described El Amarillo as a hard-to-catch figure primarily because he was native to the region. His in-depth understanding of the local rural areas allowed him to move his personnel stealthily, thereby evading law enforcement’s gaze for an extended period.</p>
