  <p>Lawmakers are demanding transparency from the intelligence community about alleged covert operations concerning UFOs - specifically, the retrieval of crashed UFOs and subsequent efforts to reverse-engineer their technology.</p>

<p>Whistleblower David Grusch has made significant claims under oath regarding such secret programs. During a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 26, Grusch suggested that the government has been engaging in such activities for decades. Yet, due to ongoing reprisal cases against him, Grusch refrained from divulging further details in the public hearing.</p>

<p>The push for truth intensified as six Congress members, including Reps. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Jared Moskowitz (D-Florida), Anna Paulina Luna (R-Florida), Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), and Andy Ogles (R-Tenn), jointly signed a letter on August 21 to Inspector General Thomas Monheim, seeking answers.</p>

<p>During the controversial UAP hearing, Grusch, a former intelligence officer and Air Force veteran, claimed firsthand knowledge about the existence of UFO technology and “biologics” of “non-human origins” dating back to the 1930s. He attested that he could provide details, albeit in a classified setting. Following the hearing, Grusch’s personal medical records surfaced in a move seen by many as an attempt to discredit his testimony.</p>

<p>Ross Coulthart, the reporter who initially covered Grusch’s statements about a concealed UFO-retrieval operation, posted Grusch’s full remarks on Twitter on August 8. This elicited a fervent response from Rep. Burchett, condemning the leak of Grusch’s medical details as a desperate ploy to conceal the truth.</p>

<p>The July 26 hearing also featured testimony from former military pilots, Ryan Graves and David Fravor, who recounted their encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) while airborne. Fravor, a retired Navy pilot, described observing the now-infamous “Tic Tac UFO” during a 2004 training mission.</p>

<p>Concluding a two-hour-long hearing on July 26, Rep. Ogles expressed concerns about the potential national security implications. This concern has led to bipartisan efforts in the Senate to declassify and release UFO-related documents, uniting political adversaries in a quest for truth about these unidentified phenomena.</p>
