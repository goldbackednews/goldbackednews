  <p>In a fresh surge of violence in Nigeria, reportedly perpetrated by militants identified as the “Fulani militia”, 21 individuals have lost their lives in two central Plateau state villages. This gruesome act was executed despite the establishment of government checkpoints following alerts of potential attacks from local bandits.</p>

<p>The affected regions, part of Heipang, Plateau, have a significant number of internally displaced civilians. Historically, Plateau sits within Nigeria’s “Middle Belt”, acting as a division between the nation’s Muslim-dominant north and Christian-dominant south. Over the years, this region has been witness to a series of jihadist attacks, aiming to eradicate the Christian populace. Predominantly, these attacks are launched by young males from the majority-Muslim Fulani group. Reports suggest that these attackers typically enter on motorcycles or horses, wielding weapons like guns and machetes. Their objective is clear – to seize local property and agricultural land.</p>

<p>Christian humanitarian organizations active in this area have noted systematic attempts to displace Christian communities, primarily comprising smaller ethnic groups with little political influence on a federal level. Their intention is to replace these communities with Muslim inhabitants. A report from June, released by the Catholic group Aid to the Church in Need, underlined attempts by Fulani terrorists to eradicate Christianity from the Middle Belt. Shockingly, over 7,600 fatalities were reported between January 2021 and June 2022. While some global entities, including the Nigerian government and United Nations, label this situation as a territorial conflict exacerbated by climate change, local Christian groups vehemently refute these claims, emphasizing the religious persecution aspect.</p>

<p>Details of the recent Heipang incident pinpoint the time of the attack between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Thursday. Initial counts identified 17 casualties, primarily villagers previously displaced due to similar violence. Additionally, four members of a local vigilante group, formed in the absence of adequate police protection, were also reported dead. Thirteen others have been critically injured.</p>

<p>It’s alarming to note that over the past two decades, the Heipang community has seen the loss of more than 100 villagers due to such attacks, without any arrests being made. Various Nigerian media outlets have, to an extent, concurred that Fulani terrorists orchestrated these attacks. However, the descriptions provided differ amongst sources, with some being cautious in directly associating the act with the Fulani group.</p>

<p>Father Remigius Ihyula, a Catholic priest from the neighboring Benue state, explained that many in the Nigerian media deliberately avoid specifying the identity of Fulani jihadist attackers, fearing potential backlash. He noted the often-used terms “bandits” or “unknown gunmen” are misleading and called for accurate portrayal.</p>

<p>In response to this week’s incident, the government highlighted the establishment of early checkpoints. However, these measures proved inadequate as terrorists circumvented them. Plateau State Governor Caleb Mutfwang expressed his condolences and urged security agencies to strengthen their efforts to cease these senseless fatalities.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, non-Fulani aligned Muslim entities also reproached the government’s actions. The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) separated itself from Thursday’s horrific onslaught, placing blame squarely on security forces for their delay in response.</p>
