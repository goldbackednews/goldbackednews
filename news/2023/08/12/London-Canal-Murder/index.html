  <p>In a horrifying revelation, a woman’s severed head was found in a London canal, not far from where dismembered body parts had been earlier discovered inside a suitcase. This grim tale was revealed in a British court on Friday.</p>

<p>33-year-old Arizo Nour was arraigned via video link at the renowned Old Bailey, London’s central criminal court. Nour is charged with the murder of a 57-year-old woman, whose identity is being withheld due to legal constraints, as reported by The Sun.</p>

<p>Prosecutors described to the court the grisly series of events: earlier in the week, “human body parts” were retrieved from a canal near Bulls Bridge Lane. It was on Thursday that a severed head, believed to belong to the same victim, was found inside a bag within the canal.</p>

<p>Further unfolding the chilling narrative, it was stated that authorities had been called to a residence on August 6, only to find “large quantities of blood.” Alerted by the discovery, the police marked Nour as a person of interest. The prosecutor, Louise Oakley, articulated the urgency of the situation, noting concerns raised about the victim’s wellbeing, as she hadn’t been in contact for over 24 hours.</p>

<p>The search eventually led to a suitcase in the canal, with its macabre contents revealing human body parts.</p>

<p>With the case sending shockwaves through the community, Nour remains in police custody. As of the latest report, no bail application has been made on his behalf.</p>
